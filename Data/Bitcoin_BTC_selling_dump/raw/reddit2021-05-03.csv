I ended up putting what I pulled out into the Stock market instead in a broadly diversified index fund in a Roth IRA. Bitcoin was just....hype and speculation to me. Assuming I could buy low and sell it high to the “next sucker” as some people put it. There’s not real return on investment other then that...no dividends and was extremely volatile to trade....just hope that it will go up higher then what I bought in at. Plus I don’t have to worry about the stock market going to 0 in the next 35-40 years when I have to retire. If that were to happen then it would be the end of the worlds economy and capitalism as we know it...probably be world war 3 or hell even 4 by that point too. Granted the stock market has had an incredible 10 year bull run since the last recession/crash and the average return was about 13% per year...I know that getting in now I won’t see the same returns because we’re most likely heading into a correction/recession which is normal...especially after such a historic bull run...but I will still collect dividends to reinvest and DCA down my position so those future returns are greater and help make up for those slower few years to come",Opeth4Lyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9zjvks/just_being_a_realist_here_i_am_sold_my_bags/,Just being a realist here .

Golem/GNT. Been running a node for about 14 months now. Yes, everyday. The technology behind it is pretty good and I can see why it would be very useful to people who need to render large projects but lack the processing power to do so. As it is decentralised you aren't trusting just one person with your work who can then potentially take it and claim it as their own - you are essentially splitting up the workload to people all over the globe who complete pieces at a time.

>i wont be giving a fuck about thousand-fuckin-dollars “transfer fee” from banks just as long it gets to where it supposed to be , and have a peace of mind that if ever i get hacked, the funds are secured.

Are you aware that during the GFC in some countries such as Malta the government literally seized money from peoples bank accounts? The reason why Bitcoin was created was kinda due to this - No one can touch the wallet unless they have the private keys.

>Whats the use of this? We got ETH, ETC ,Eth Gold and the list goes on and on and on. Whats the difference? I dont know what, the “technology?” ,

I do agree this is getting a bit ridiculous. Coinmarketcap right now lists 2071 coins & only the strongest will survive. Take an example, I was having a look through the coins when the bubble was at its height in December17/January18 and I found a coin called ""Pizzacoin"". You might be asking WTF is this and what purpose does it serve. Go ahead and try and find it on Coinmarketcap, you won't be able to, it does not come up in any searches. You can however write it on Google and it will be the first link: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pizzacoin/ and the website listed on there doesn't even go anywhere http://pizzacoin.net/

That's an example of a coin that's died. Nothing is certain. This same thing was witnessed with the Dotcom boom. If you want to partake, don't put in money you are willing to lose. You don't need to own a whole coin. you can buy $50 worth of Bitcoin if you want.",Spacesider,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9zjvks/just_being_a_realist_here_i_am_sold_my_bags/,Just being a realist here .

5970,2019-12-23 14:26:49,"Lets consider for a moment what 'pricing in' of a known future event means. In a normal asset like a stock which is assessed on the basis of expected cashflows, it means that people incorporate the expected cashflows from the event into valuation models and the resultant price that comes out of such a model becomes the fair price on the basis of which participants become willing to buy or sell. Thus, the market consensus moves on to a level that 'prices in' the known event.

In the case of Bitcoin, there is no such cash flow based valuation model. The price of Bitcoin at any time depends on

1. number of people wanting and willing to buy in to the available supply and the
2. number of existing owners willing to sell
3. new supply entering the market each day.

Now even if known in advance that the last factor is going to reduce on account of halving, will it necessarily mean that more number of people are willing to buy in today or fewer are willing to sell? Perhaps, but that sort of change can come only from those who have low time preference i.e are willing to buy more bitcoin that they would otherwise have had they not heard of halving or not willing to sell bitcoin for a while although would have if it were not for halving coming up.

Only after halving event can people revert to their original time preference and still sustain the price because the factor 3) becomes a reality.

Investors can temporarily but not permanently change their investing time preference but factor 3 does permanently change on halving. This is why I believe that while you can see pre-halving runups because of anticipation, such runups can dump down but it is only after halving that a permanent new level of factor 3) manifests which changes the picture sustainably.

Since we haven't even seen a pre-halving run up yet, I cannot see how it can be argued that the level that will be steady state after factor 3 really manifests, is already priced in.",aaj094,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/eefaaq/daily_discussion_monday_december_23_2019/,"[Daily Discussion] Monday, December 23, 2019"

5968,2019-12-24 08:32:09,"So, I’m glum to admit it but after a few years of studying what I can about TA and trading, I took a stab at it with a small amount of play money (a few hundred bucks over the last few weeks) and have basically done what 90% of all traders do.

I think the lesson for me is that the emotional piece is (at least at this point) too much for me to handle when it comes it short term trading. I’m too risk averse and set my stop losses too tight, and miss moves, and then I revenge trade in response. Definitely understand the value of trading using bots - or at least with really tight rules in place. I think that TA is designed to exploit the emotions of the masses, but if you get carried away with your emotions when you’re trying to employ it, you’ll get exploited along with everyone else!

I’m part of the 21 million club (plus extra) and continuing to add.

6124,2020-03-15 03:38:58,"All kinds of fud at the moment but it is an objective fact that in two month, Bitcoin and gold would be the only large liquid assets with large and similar stock to flow. No virus changes that fact and I would suggest not to be deluded enough to think that this won't be noticed soon. 

And also look back at previous instances (actually across any asset class) when price has crashed by this extent and yet the approach of waiting to buy lower has actually reaped dividends. In reality, if it goes lower, you won't actually buy because the fud would be higher by then. And by the time the fud actually dissipates, the price would be much higher than now. Exactly like how so many waited to buy sub 2k in early 2019 and then ended up panick buying above 7k.

Buy low folks, buy low. Not buy high after fud goes away. As simple as that.",aaj094,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ficqmi/daily_discussion_saturday_march_14_2020/,"[Daily Discussion] Saturday, March 14, 2020"

What’s crazy is that all this is going to complete give power over to institutions when everything is done. So many institutions were late to crypto. We drop to the possible low levels, they scoop up and retail is once again behind. 

Unfortunately, with the high leverage exchanges currently controlling the market, I believe the only way to break the current cycle is for institutions to have a much larger control of the market. It’s a completely different market than 2-3 years ago.

6114,2020-03-15 06:13:53,"If this was a 50% pump during an uptrend breaking a 5 year long trendline, there would be almost noone here calling it the top. And yet, most people have assumed that this can't get worse largely because their emotions rely on the price going up. Could this candle be similar to the President Xi candle that went up and retraced the entire way? Yes, possibly. However, we got rejected at resistance, and had constant, limitless momentum down as soon as that pump was over. In this case, apart from the initial pump from the bottom (which only happened because of Bitmex's liquidation system), this has basically been going sideways.

When the price goes sideways after a huge volume candle, you assume continuation of the trend. Therefore, I will assume that we make another low. I will not short this since margin exchanges love to stop out shorts (and I recommend noone does either), so I will simply sell my holdings on spot exchanges. I'll wait for some sort of support to hit lower if it breaks the low to buy and possibly sell at a higher price.

Coronavirus FUD is real and in the US, it seems to be just getting started.  And if that is the case, the numbers will go way up in the US in the next 1-2 weeks as these things initially work up exponentially.  So US can be about 1 week behind where France is and 2 weeks behind where Italy is at the moment.  This means that if you wait 1-2 weeks, there might be even more panic in the US whereas there is an asymmetrical effect that even if it is not as bad as Italy/France, there won't be a single moment that will propel the BTC price upward either.  So there is nothing in the 1-2 weeks horizon that will lead to BTC making a run as opposed to potentiality of making it worse.

Volume is currently dying off which means we'll be seeing a big move soon. As I've stated before, the massive volume V shaped bottom means that probably is *the* bottom, and it is likely our next move will take us back above 6k. If we do make a move down my best guess will be mid to low 4's, with a slow grind down and a slow grind up making a nice round bottom.

As for macro events and the market at large, I think we could get some more bad news in the next few weeks that will cause more panic selling in traditional markets and crypto, but overall I think the equity markets have already priced in a recession. That's why we saw such a huge drop so quickly. We are down about 30% from the top and you can imagine that most businesses would see about a 30% drop in economic activity in the next few quarters to a year, hence why it is priced in. Then the markets will start to expand again from that level. But, of course, people, and therefore the markets, will most likely overreact to any bad news and markets will drop more in the coming weeks, crypto included. 

tl;dr - Global fears are well founded, but have been mostly priced in.

By nature it's deflationary. There's a hard cap to the amount of it, and once we reach it, slowly over time the supply will diminish as wallets get lost and money is not spent. Yes this causes the value per Bitcoin to always increase and this is the issue, it would eliminate investing as by design the value of anything in terms of Bitcoin will decrease why put money into a any avenue of investing back into the economy if you'll have a better return of value just holding the currency, this would destroy any way of funding a business. Why would you buy something now for say half a Bitcoin when in a year by design you'll be paying much less Bitcoin, it would crush consumer spending, in turn gdp as well. All recessions have been deflationary (obviously) and they're not mutually exclusive they both cause the other, how would having a permanently deflationary currency not lead to a permanent depression, as obviously the gdp in Bitcoin we produce will have to go down.",philmacrack123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gaqtye/daily_discussion_april_30_2020/,"Daily Discussion, April 30, 2020"

6232,2020-05-03 03:59:20,"So what's everyone's plans or advice in the next week regarding trading? I recently bought a small amount to trade and not hodl only £50 worth. What I'm hoping for is another one or two sudden increases in price before the halving (halvening is not a word, please stop using it) maybe to £8k/$10k and I'm going to set a sell order at this price. I expect a drop shortly after, how much who knows but maybe a retrace to the current levels or a bit under. This is all speculation of course and none of this is to be taken as advice. However I do feel that if the stock market relapses again then crypto will follow suit again. A good piece of advice, that admittedly means keeping your coins on an exchange, is to set buy orders at silly prices. If bitcoin is trundling along sideways then always set a sell order for several hundred pounds/dollars/euro higher than the current price. There's often spike increases in price for a few minutes then it goes back to sideways and it can mean easy free sats when you buy in again £600 lower. But it could be a run from 7k to 8k and you miss out on money. Weigh the risks and decide for yourself.

Edit - similar to the sudden drop bitcoin experienced around six weeks ago. If you had a cheeky buy order at £4,000 you'd be quids in by now (it went slightly lower but buy orders that match the lowest price, well you better buy a few lottery tickets when you make bank with the bull run).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gbts6y/daily_discussion_may_2_2020_gmt0/,"Daily Discussion - May 2, 2020 (GMT+0)"

[https://i.imgur.com/ARZLNyr.png](https://i.imgur.com/ARZLNyr.png)

Magic line (purple) is the most interesting long term trend line. We violated this line and it acted now as resistance.

The previous ATH lead to a falling wedge (blue). I know it violated the lines, but I argued for it in the past because of the volume profile. This wedge broke up leading to the previous local high @ 13k.

Currently we are in a broadening descending wedge formation (red).

The orange symmetrical wedge might be our current mega strucutre. This mega structure reformed, as you could draw different types of such symmetrical wedges in the past, now it is much flatter.

If this last orange symmetrical wedge acts as bullish pattern together with the blue broadening descending wedge, we could retest the magic line at the end of 2021 / beginning of 2022. If that happens we might see a BTC price of roughly 40k per Bitcoin (only so low as the wedge is flatter).

This could be the moment where everybody screems for 100k per Bitcoin and gets disappointed, as our wedge already played out and the magic line acts again as resistance.",noeeel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/girjqw/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_13_2020/,"[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, May 13, 2020"

If this trend sticks for next few days, it will be a good indicator that there isn't much of miner reserve inventory sitting out there. Then we can can expect to race off the blocks on the back of the lower issuance.

Think this can be attributed to miners selling a lot of stash in March during the mother dip. Can be seen in the 'Featured chart ' tab where you can see that in March, 1st spend volume was almost always higher than issuance.",aaj094,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/girjqw/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_13_2020/,"[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, May 13, 2020"

5205,2020-05-20 11:59:44,"Inspired from reading u/dexX7 comments about search trends:   


Usually when I read or hear about h2buy BTC and related trends being up, I consider it a fairly bullish narrative.  Same with stocks.   However given the current global crisis issue how plausible is it that we have or will have massive retail fomo with anyone who even has money to put in?  
Just thinking about the stats this way, could that be considered the dumb money in this situation?  
For retail interest, retail doesn't drive the market alone anymore.  So could there be larger players just dumping sells into us retail and getting ready to walk away for massive global bear market?   
These are the main questions I'm asking myself tonight, if there's responses I'm happy to read them, the question's aren't meant to be rhetorical or leading.   


I'm just super curious of your or anyone else's thoughts on this.  I don't post very often at all however I come here to read a lot, usually looking for sentiment considerations and fresh ideas to think about.   
I'm personally at a weird impasse where part of me is thinking:  
*Bullish scenario*:  ""this is a perfect time for BTC and crypto to take off""   
(1) it's a perfectly unsuspecting time to run the bull it's completely irrational to do so.   
(2) between the money printer and the pandemic crisis this creates a unique situation to get some larger players that may normally see this space as 'risky' to think it's 'less risky' than usual as it's a 'hard money' and lots of retail has liquidated out.  
   
*Bearish scenario:*  ""the global economy is going to get worse and this is a really ideal time for big holders to get out""   
(1) a lot of the new printing is winding up in the hands/power of those with the highest money velocity, which also is a lot of people with the largest wealth which means holding fiat may not be as risky for them as we as retail perceive""    
(2) with so much retail interest being drummed up off the halvening and all the bullish narrative on the horizon this is a great scenario for dumping bags and letting retail get caught at the top of a new multi-year bear market. the excuse would be recorded as the pandemic and it would truly introduce a new meaning to a 'max pain' scenario.  


Including this information for people that would like to treat my sentiment for their own indicator or counter indicator.   
*Regarding trades:*   
As a trader I don't trade very often at all either.  I am more often hold and buy on major dips,  thinking about 10 years down the road. However I do swing trade for weeks or months at a time.  
*Regarding current thoughts on a my trade strategy:*   
For the first time since I got in, in 2015, I'm considering liquidating half of my entire holdings in this space.  However not being in a situation where I'd have to even if everything collapsed for 5 years moving forward I'd be acting to do so to try to prep and take advantage of a prolonged downward move from here.   


*Regarding my gut:*   
 My gut tells me BTC is going to break upwards and run for a bit, how long my gut does not give me any feels about.  My friend and I keep gut tracker totals of each instance and we don't have these instances often, mine has \~65% accuracy so far, however over the past years I haven't submitted many at all, only 14 gut instances over 5 years.

I'm still going with my prediction from a week or so ago though, that we continue to form a decent sized sym triangle squeezing into mid June before, hopefully...a break upwards above the 10k level - [https://www.tradingview.com/i/RPCMdirm/](https://www.tradingview.com/i/RPCMdirm/)

Null and void should we break and close above 10k at any point from now on a 4hour basis.

&#x200B;

The reason i'm still leaning to lower prices in the coming week is well a) I'd much prefer a bigger consolidation between say 8.5k and 10k before we break up and also because.. b). I'm seeing way too many people just assuming now that the break above 10k and beyond is now a given 100%.

Hate seeing that.. most are not even talking about lower prices anymore..just moon talk and the fact that we'll definitely be going up real soon.

5214,2020-05-20 23:03:45,"Always interesting times in the world of Bitcoin. My hope is that regardless of what Technical Analysis you use, either you were positioned short or sold at the top before the 3% correction earlier today.

For about the last 16 hours or so, the 4H Intraday chart has been reflecting a price pinned beneath the upper trendline on increasing volume, while the lows have been pinned around $9,600 indicating a strong move was imminent. The failure to break the $9,840 price level on heavy volume signaled insufficient buyers in the market to push the Bitcoin price higher into breakout, sparking the first leg of the Wyckoff Distribution. Sometimes those bags can just get too heavy.

[4H Intraday Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddfDH3AU/)

The Intraday chart reflects a low price target of $9,260 *should* have been realized \[$9,860 - ((($9,860 - $9,560)\*3)\*2/3)\]. In the end the bottom part of the new trade range was discovered at $9,300 or $40 above the target price, which is well within the delta I’ve experienced using the Vertical Count Method in Point and Figure. Also, $9,300 is a significant psychological support level.

Once the breakdown went beyond $9,500 (three boxes below the prior low), a Low Pole Warning was signaled. A Low Pole Reversal generally results in a 50% retrace in the breakdown range from the prior low ($9,560) to the bottom of the breakdown ($9,300), which would have targeted a retrace to the $9,440 level. The Low Pole Reversal realized the $9,440 price target, stalled, and then pushed higher as shorts covered their positions.

We are currently seeking the upper end of the new Intraday trade range. I speculate it will be around the $9,540 level.

If we look at a higher timeframe (1D), the most recent high topped out at $9,940 which was the same level as the Secondary Test of the upper range of this Wyckoff Distribution. A double top (which is Bullish in Point and Figure) was formed which broke the upper trendline of the formation, suggesting bullish bias and the Parabolic SAR flipped bullish as well. 

[1D Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0wjxkKnl/)

While the signals all reflect bullish sentiment, I feel we will more likely test the lower end of the trading range ($8,120) and establish a Sign of Weakness (SOW) somewhere between $8,120 and $7,700 before retracing to the upper end of the trading range ($10,060) and possibly hitting $10,300 in a final Upward Thrust before completing the Wyckoff Distribution Phase.

A lot of people in crypto seem to struggle understanding why inflation is good for the economy. 

So let me tell you why inflation is good for a currency. 

Say it’s Ancient Greece and there’s a town. The only thing this town produces is copper. There is one copper mine that the entire economy is based off of. Let’s say 1000 dollars. 

Now let’s say this town discovers iron, and opens up an iron mine. What happens to the original 1000 dollars? If it’s a fixed amount, like Bitcoin, this can lead to two unfair outcomes. Either the money doesn’t leave the copper mine, which means Iron, while being a new technology, gets no economic benefit since the money doesn’t leave copper. Or, the money now splits between copper and iron, now meaning copper has lost 50% of its value! But of course copper didn’t become 50% less effective. Neither of these outcomes are optimal. 

This is why inflation is NECESSARY for economic growth. This is why the Fed targets the inflation rate to equal the GDP growth rate. This is the only way to achieve a fair outcome where copper wouldn’t lose its value and new value can be created. This is how the economy reconciles technological advancement.",UsernameIWontRegret,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/h9537y/daily_discussion_june_15_2020_gmt0/,"Daily Discussion - June 15, 2020 (GMT+0)"

4916,2020-09-13 11:32:39,"Not gonna lie, we're in a pretty bullish scenario. We are up roughly 15% in 2 months but OI across all exchanges is exactly the same, as are future premiums. And future premiums being exactly the same (roughly 5-6% APR) is particularly amazing. We are up about 50% YTD, 15% in 2 months and yet futures are at an annualized 5-6%. Imo, this shows the market is actually quite bearish. When bitcoin is moving up and people have very muted expectations, that's a bullish indicator.

Also, since OI is roughly the same as when it was in July and yet we are 15% higher, I think that implies our price increase is due almost entirely to spot buying and holding.

Edit: Conspiracy time. All those bids on CBP are going to get filled. A whale demands it. Paint the chart to make it look like a fake breakout happened. Everyone gets bearish and dumps their coins into those massive bids. Then we bounce.

4931,2020-09-13 15:04:18,"The good news, we’ve broken out of the bear pennant and daily MACD is close to turning positive. 
We have also for now avoided the dreaded weekly MACD negative cross. That was a line in the sand for me. 

Now you’d need to close a daily above 10650 and I’d be looking at a test of the 11k range. 

The not so good news. 
Above price we now have the 20EMA and the 50. With a bearish cross of both. 
So a classic rejection play here would be a retest into that cross area. An easy place to short if you were so inclined. Stops being easy to place and risk reward pretty decent if you looked for a fall back down to the 10.3 to 10k area. 

I will regain medium term bullishness should we close a daily above the 50EMA. Until then I’m mid term bearish/sideways. 

A BGD would be lovely but those things are so unpredictable. 

So far the lines in the sand Bull market wise have not been crossed - the weekly 20EMA and the Daily 200. As long as Bitcoin remains above both (closing), then the Bull market is still active. 

A good show of strength from the bulls should follow soon if the strength is there. We’ve retested the MA region and now they need continuation of this retest with the daily close above 10650 to convince the average trader that Bitcoin has for now survived the drop.

*Update to say that Bitcoin is currently being rejected by the Daily 10EMA. Another hourly Bart with no continuation.

**And now price has been pushed back further, so for now the bears are in control of the shorter term time frames.

He posts great content so y'all should definitely give him a follow.

As of writing, the premium on Dec futures is something like ~0.40% (so with ~103 days to expiry, an implied funding rate of 0.0047% per day).

Swap funding is -0.03% per period right now on Mex which seems insane to me, considering the price is *above* $10,000.

When the price was roughly the same back in February (pre-Corona death drop), Mex XBTUSD open interest was > $1.0B. Today, it's roughly 1/2 that (despite the same price). Obviously some of this could be attributed to BitMEX losing market share to Binance/FTX/etc., but certainly not all. FWIW, open interest on CME is 50%+ *higher* than Feb levels.

This seems like a very bullish setup, especially in the context of upcoming Q4.

3127,2020-10-29 05:59:54,"We're still above 13k and funding is about to go really negative, lol wtf. We are at resistance here so I don't want to get out of my short since you should never buy resistance, but something tells me that I should. All future premiums have dropped substantially, too.

This could still drop, and I honestly should wait for a little before making any decisions, but 13k is looking mighty strong.

Edit: To add a bit more to this - the reason we could be seeing such strength from BTC is from the most basic of fundamentals, supply vs demand. I don't know if demand has increased that dramatically but I think supply is dwindling fast.

People are shorting bitcoin since traditional markets are going down, hence the negative funding rate and the massive decrease to future premiums. But bitcoin isn't a company. There's nothing to sell, dividends to pay, or customers to make happy. Simple supply and demand dictate everything, and anyone who is currently buying bitcoin is probably just locking it away for at least a year. And when supply is gone, the price moves higher.

I'm still expecting a drop of at least 20% sometime in the near future, but it is looking less likely that it will happen at this price point.

Possibly something like this?

Tje only other way someone could be holding it for a century is someone puts it in cold storage and forgets about it only for it to be discovered by their offspring or something. Moreover, if bitcoin is adopted for day to day transactions, I doubt people will be holding it for a century. The trading volume / transactions volume will increase overtime. Also, it is true, some of the bitcoins people put in cold storage will never see the light particularly for because of saving. We all save some money or atleast try to. This will be a test for bitcoin to see if it can sustain value and if it's a good source to to save and spend.

2596,2020-11-28 01:23:54,"Here is [my response](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fvdtom/money_printer_go_brrr/fmilqmj/) whenever Tether FUD raises its head:

tl;dr:

The price goes up way more *before* a Tether grant than it does after. This is consistent with Tether being granted in response to demand, rather then to fraudulently inflate the price.

Here's a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bmKa-fXCzWA_HpDhIa-z-AylhxRpH683z2QT6rlqPis/edit?usp=sharing) I did back in June last year.

I tracked all Tether controlled actions from 2014 until June of 2019, when I gave up. This is across all blockchains at the time, which were BTC, ETH, and TRON.

Sheet 1 has every day, sheet 2 has just the Tether actions.

Looking at the grants and prints (""grants""), there were 83 total. I have identified the amount of each grant as well as the percentage of the BTC market cap and BTC daily volume of each one as of the date of each grant.

The Price 30 before (column M) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
> (BTC closing price on date of grant) / (BTC closing price 30 days prior to grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price the day of the grant was $330.08. 30 days prior, the price was $484.83.
> 
> $330.08/$484.83 = 68.08%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price is higher on the date of the grant than it was 30 days before the grant was made.

The Price 10 before (column N) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
> (BTC closing price on date of grant) / (BTC closing price 10 days prior to grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price the day of the grant was $330.08. 10 days prior, the price was $404.42.
> 
> $330.08/$404.42 = 81.62%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price is higher on the date of the grant than it was 10 days before the grant was made.

The Price 30 after (column O) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
>  (BTC closing price 30 days after grant) / (BTC closing price on date of grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price 30 days after the grant was $339.49. On the day of the grant, the closing price was $330.08.
> 
> $339.49/$330.08 = 102.85%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price increased 30 days after the grant was made. If the entry in this column is <100% then the price decreased 30 days after the grant was made.

The Price 10 after (column P) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
>  (BTC closing price 10 days after grant) / (BTC closing price on date of grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price 10 days after the grant was $382.56. On the day of the grant, the closing price was $330.08.
> 
> $382.56/$330.08 = 115.92%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price increased 10 days after the grant was made. If the entry in this column is <100% then the price decreased 10 days after the grant was made.

At the bottom of each column on Sheet 2 is the average for each column.

We can see that for the average of Price 30 before (column M) is 128.19%. On days that Tether was granted, on average, the price was 28.19% higher than it was 30 days prior. 56 of the 83 Tether grants were made on days that were more than 100% compared to 30 days prior. Only 27 grants were made on days where the price was lower than 30 days prior.

Similarly, for the Price 10 before (column N), on days that Tether was granted, on average, the price was ~6% higher than it was 10 days before. 49 grants were made on days where the price was more than 100% of the price 10 days prior. Only 34 grants were made on days where the price was lower than 10 days prior.

On the other hand, when you look at the Price 30 after (column O), on average, 30 days after a Tether grant, the price changed by an average of 15%. For 43 Tether grants, the price was higher 30 days after the grant than it was the day of the grant. For 40 grants, the price was lower 30 days after the grant than the day of the grant.

And similarly, for the Price 10 after (column P), on average, 10 days after a Tether grant, the price increased by an average of 4%. For 46 grants, the price was higher 10 days after the grant compared to the price the day of the grant, leaving the other 37 to be lower 10 days after the grant.

If Tether were totally legit, what would we expect to see? Grants would be more likely, but not exclusively, to be made, *after* significant positive price changes. We would expect to see more grants made when the price is locally high. I would suggest that is what this data reflects.

If Tether were a scam used to pump BTC or cryptocurrency, then we would expect to see that the price after a grant would be significantly greater than the price at or prior to a grant. We would expect that the price following a grant would be significantly greater than the price prior to and during a grant. I would suggest that this data does not show that. While the data does show that the average price increases following a grant, this increase is not to the same extent as the price increases *prior to* each grants.",Shortupdate,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/k1tzvx/daily_discussion_friday_november_27_2020/,"[Daily Discussion] Friday, November 27, 2020"

Inflows of crypto to exchanges are at their highest levels since March '20; this has historically preceded significant dumps fairly reliably. [Source](https://www.coindesk.com/quick-bitcoin-price-recovery-looks-in-doubt-as-whales-move-coins-onto-exchanges)

As the price hovers a few thousand USD below ATH, jittery bears or traumatized 2017-era vets will be looking for any strong signal to cash out, which could very quickly lead to a major retracement imo. 

At the same time, the longer we vacillate around the 16.8-17.5k region, the more this starts to look like semi-solid support, and this could rather quickly re-instill confidence in buyers and affirm the immediate primacy of the longer-term bullish signals we're all watching.

Once the price drops, it can trigger automatic selloffs for a while because there are lots of automatic trading bots in the market, before market sentiment either causes the price to continue the crash, or to recover through demand.

Bitcoin is a particularly volatile market, meaning that it moves up and down a lot relative to the price, but honestly I wouldn't even say that today is particularly unusual.

6189,2020-12-22 22:28:24,"Nice work man. I have spent a ton of time trying to work out trading strategies using Python. Used the BITMEX API and now the Bybit api, calculated the RSI over all time, then ran a PnL calculation over different timeframes. I found it pretty much isn't correlated enough with the trade fees to stay over 1.0 PnL consistently. I have other things to try like simple 4h MA people have mentioned here, and maybe something with neural networks but feeling a little demotivated by my results so far. I used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Numpy.

It's interesting you mentioned Gaussian filters for smoothing. I tried using a Savitsky Golay filter from the Scipy package and thought I'd discovered the holy grail until I realized you have to re-bias it for the current time and that pretty much removed all its predictive power, so I wasn't sure what to do (I'm ChemE so I'm good at math but I don't know that much stats). Curious to hear more.

My bags are so smol now. Nano sucks. The NF did the slowest rug pull of all time! Crypto was never meant for payments and superior economics never play out. Tech doesn't matter! COO is only a trophy employee. 

0.5% supply from devs are just going to dump on you for years and Colin's mom owns 90% of all wallets. Fite me!

Also, buy XRP and dump this shitcoin. I'll rather die from suffocating in Bitcoin related emissions than hold this wealth sucking scam. This coin is as fake as the Corona virus. No sewage disposal can ever manage this dumping.

It’s bizarre at this juncture to observe masses of people blindly believing Bitcoin to be this perfectly made thing that can solve any and all problems frictionlessly when they present themselves.

Watching Bitcoin zealots at this point is like watching a drunk person slur talk with childlike glee over a dubious business venture, when you’re sober or in the least still got control of your faculties, it’s a tiresome and at its extreme, alarming.

The fair value is the average price like the middle line on this chart. Of course it varies greatly above and below as all markets have overbought and oversold conditions, this is the process of price discovery.

its not about holders

SEC is not motivated by what concerns an average holder

they dont do it this way

and I dont think SEC was aiming to directly destroy XRP holders or their value

SEC simply saw massive bitcoin rally on the horizon, and they should of been dumb not to see it, right?, then immediately jerried that a huge rally is likely to bring XRP price to higher levels

now then, according to SEC, garlington and larsen are implicated in selling XRP as an unregistered security

now, why let these guys profit immensely off selling XRP amid inbound bitcoin surge?

so they launched their lawsuit to pre-empt garlington and larson from further selling their shares, knowing that a rally this huge could drag XRP along to an ATH thus maximizing their profits

again, why let garlington take advantage of this rally, while SEC insider could take out a short and then toss a lawsuit at garlington?

if bitcoin rallied in august they would of brought the litigation in august

they didint want to let Ripple Labs keep on with the selling, and seeing that they now have no chance but to take action within their regulatory framework, they went to nail G&L asses to the deck with thick large headed screws, and did it right away

its not about protection of shareholders, because SEC probably decided to not deem it their competence to weight in the current situation, and consequences and whatnot and how this might impinge on ripple holders' portfolios

they simply wanted to prevent the CEO and board from profiting further",MiscellaneousPlot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/kp0cqw/sec_deliberately_timed_this_lawsuit_to_reck_xrp/,SEC Deliberately Timed this Lawsuit to RECK XRP HODLERS Period

1463,2021-01-03 03:57:05,"Just thinking loud here... So you all think that it is OK for Ripple execs to dump XRP? I mean there is nothing wrong with them setting up bots to cover up their asses when they sold tokens? I get it, discussion about XRP itself can take a while, but Ripple’s execs making $ while they “believe” in XRP seems a bit unethical to me. I would be be totally fine if they sold XRP to fund Ripple’s operations, but that was not the case. Moreover, I am surprised that many XRP holders think that this behavior is ok. If you believe in XRP why would you dump it (let’s forget about price manipulation allegations)? Maybe XRP and Ripple is the next system that will replace swift and will become a standard, but Ripple’s execs dumping coins while everyone eats shit seems to me extremely unethical and shows imo that all execs cared about is to make $ despite all of their statements (actions speak louder). I am not saying I do not believe in XRP, but execs actions definitely make me think twice about what exactly Ripple as a company wants to accomplish.

1470,2021-01-03 04:57:40,"Look at it from an objective point of view and see that the lawsuit didnt come overnight and could have been predicted.

**28 U.S.C. § 2462** states that “\[e\]xcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained **unless commenced within five years** from the date when the claim first accrued if, within the same period, the offender or the property is found within the United States in order that proper service may be made thereon.”

From the Complaint:
**67.** Starting in **at least 2015**, however, Ripple decided that it would seek to make XRP a “universal \[digital\] asset” for banks and other financial institutions to effect money transfers.

**68.** According to Ripple’s plans, to create acceptance for the universal digital asset, Ripple first had to create an active, liquid XRP secondary trading market. It therefore continued its efforts to develop a use for XRP while increasing sales of XRP into the market.

**74.** Garlinghouse joined Ripple as COO in **April 2015** and substantially assisted its ongoing unregistered Offering by, among other things, being responsible for its operations.

Larsen, Garlinghouse & Co. knew the Filing would come till EOY ( 5 year frame ) so they created a last liquidity scheme starting Juli2020.

It turns out that when you want to sell, there needs to be a buyer on the other end (Who would have thought) so the price will crash just as hard, if not more, when everyone starts selling.

In the end, it was the person (Or people) organising this that ran off with the profit. As you said, they would announce the pump and then they would sell what they had silently been accumulating over the last few weeks.

When it goes up they would sell while telling their group to continue buying and pumping.

4964,2021-01-03 08:22:48,"Adding to this, there is also the residual impact on the coin that needs to be taken into account.   
The NEBL coin (which was targeted earlier today) was sitting around the 2500 sats relatively flat.   
Then the pump and dump happens, which burns not only most of the participants but also genuine proponents of that coin.   
After the PnP then coin has settled at 1500 sats.     
Now you have a community not only with less funds but could have also destroyed or at least stalled that projects progress.    

All this is due to the HODL! mentality.

I sent a detailed report today to Binance to see if they could pinpoint the user(s) who made significant purchases of NEBL prior to the signal, and subsequently dumped it.

4969,2021-01-03 11:57:43,"Thank you for this post, this is a post that every crypto investor should read before they join a pump and dump group. I’ve been a long time investor in nebl holding a big sized position, this pump and dump was really a very bad thing that happened in Neblio’s timeline. Forget about people who were following the discord group, many holders from before did not get a chance to sell or make any profits. Only people that made profits were the p&d group admins. We the retail or the regular investors end up losing money by following such p&d groups. The only way to avoid and eliminate these p&d groups is to avoid them. The retail buyers or the channel participants are the only investment they have. This particular channel has 130K+ people and even if 10-20K people follow and market that’s a nice buying pressure which can pump prices so the group admins can simply dump their bags and the retail investors end up in losses. Please stay away from p&d groups, don’t throw your money away. Also research the coin just a little bit before investing like what’s the purpose, what’s the market cap, what’s the supply who’s behind it and what use cases does it have. Don’t blindly buy for lambo’s, the season for lambos for blindly buying a shit coin is gone, as you can see only projects with a working product and really good use cases are being stable and running during this bull season. Good luck everyone.

1452,2021-01-03 15:11:57,"The longer this pain continues, the higher we will rise. Honestly this feels so different than 2017, I was there early 2017 already. 2020 had to be the year of regulations but it has not happened. Everybody is off by 1 or even 2 years. Total market cap reaching 1 trillion, lawsuits left and right aiming for regulations, I mean guys, this is it. I know people don’t want to believe it but what will happen is that XRP will pump so hard soon. There’s always “insiders” who know what will happen. So there will be insiders who will buy the shit out of XRP even before it’s declared a non security or before some settlement is made or whatever will happen. That “small” pump will probably bring us to a dollar maybe higher... Just wait what will happen next, people will think that XRP just pumps because of the general market even it has the lawsuit going but in reality, well, someone will know something... 

Just don’t be fooled by BTC right now. There’s 600B+ in BTC, it’s not smart money to stay there, it’s smart money that is making money of the average stupid investor who still thinks that BTC has actual value. Don’t get me wrong, BTC is likely to stay but don’t be fooled that this is the nr. 1 currency out there for the next 10 years. It simply is not. 

XRP will rise hard, very hard. Flare will contribute to that massively. Imagine DeFi coming to the XRPL. It’s coming, we know it, and it’s going to be absolutely massive. 

I don’t like to make price predictions but I truly believe that 2021 will blow away some people in terms of XRP price. They will all be like “how can this be?”.

If you’ve held 2-3 years or longer, why would you sell right now? What fundamental has changed except for a stupid lawsuit? Do you think Brad and Ripple were having coffee the past 3 years with all regulators? It doesn’t make sense, it’s here to stay!

Is there anyone else that’s been around since pre 2018 who just can’t shake this sort of uneasy feeling?

I bought in mid 2017 and in late 2017 I remember all the same feelings most people are experiencing now. That excitement, that positivity (BTC to the moooon!) that feeling like it’s just going to keep going up and up (last chance to buy BTC this cheap!). 

But I just can’t shake the feeling that it’s going to crash again in the next few weeks. That’s when it happens, at peak positivity when you’re thinking this is almost too good to be true. 

Even if you zoom out on the 5 year chart and look at the 2017 bull run and compare it to this bull run, it almost looks exactly the same just on a smaller scale.

I’m still super long on Bitcoin in general and of course will be holding some long term but after this run back up to 35k, I may sell a bit of my stack.

Or I could just be wrong and it will hit $50,000 this year cause who fucking knows?

I think you underestimate the hodl training.

>Pretty sure that I and most of you here, would be all in on Bitcoin, long before it ever reached $5

I don't think so, but the builder narrative makes sense, but to work you need the speculators to assist entrepreneurs in the adoption phase.

>The price of Bitcoin should ALWAYS reflect its utility.

Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Our societies prosper when people speculate on future demand and get it correct. aka those who save for a rainy day are rewarded.

>... that made bitcoin successful in 2009

Bitcoin was not a success in 2009 it just had not evolved. Stupid rules like the 1MB limit were added to prevent imaginary threats, which later became the thing that was it's undoing.

>the constant demand from people who are buying it, because they want to use it.

No one was buying it to use it then, it was not until May 22, 2010, that bitcoin was used for the first time to buy a meal and that was a stretch.

the people who actually found it useful and used it were people who needed decentralized P2P cash for the internet. CSW hates those peopel.

>I bet most people here have been banned from [r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/) (or not and r/btc)

there is a difference between being banned for being rude, or asking the wrong questions, many people have seen the constructed narrative and they've attacked it resulting in a ban, some have asked why and been banned.

The advantage to freedom of expression is you get to understand reality, my opinions, for example, are not added to the r/bitcoin reality and as a result, I have asymmetric information. If that information is not used appropriately they benefit, but in reality, it is the people doing the banning that are handicapping themselves.

One needs to learn to play the cards they are dealt, not to hate the game.

>Real utility. Real demand. Real people.

What will drive adoption is benefits, when the benefits outweigh the costs people will use it. ""Utility"" in and of itself, is not value-creating. Solve a pressing need and you stimulate adoption.

Bitcoin can be used for good and evil. both represent utility it's just a matter of interpretation, it's not just utility, utility can serve tyranny or freedom.

You better build the utility you want, because the needs it fulfills determines who adopts it.",Adrian-X,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/kq9myq/are_you_still_waiting_for_bsv_to_dump/,Are you still waiting for BSV to dump?

6254,2021-01-09 07:26:32,"My strategy thus far has been to open a long for 10x so my liquidation rate is really low and wait a few days for the ATH to get a couple thousand higher, then to throw a 50x into it which bumps up the multiplier but the bump to liquidation rate is small enough that it still stays in what you would expect a 20x liquidation rate to be which is relatively low enough to avoid liquidation on drops.

As for shorting, you can assume for fast small gains that it will drop every day because it's fluctuations have gotten so extreme. My strategy is to open a short at the ATH of the day at 20x so it usually puts it 1 or 2 grand above the ATH and let it wait. I usually get like a 30% return on that when it does drop the 1 or 2 grand during the day that the daily pattern shows, and then I put the gains from the short into the long at 20x or 50x at the lower price.

So I mean, you can play the market, but I like what you're saying about the market not crashing (hopefully).

5130,2021-01-10 05:42:05,"This is a well thought out and well laid out point by what seems to be a seasoned investor.  I agree with 100% of what  [u/KlausStortebeker](https://www.reddit.com/user/KlausStortebeker/) states and would like to add a couple of additional thoughts of my own:

1. I've been hearing the larger exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini, Fidelity, etc.) are following Grayscale into personalized portfolio construction of Altcoins for their institutional clients (in addition to just custody).  As institutional assets scale into Crypto, not being on Coinbase or Gemini will seriously disadvantage ICX vs. other projects.  Right now the majority of institutional funds are flowing into BTC and ETH, but Grayscale's digital large cap fund and personalized funds are growing in tandem and I expect them to grow faster than their BTC or ETH funds.  Imagine 100's of $bn's flowing into the Altcoin space and ICX not being a part of that fund flow.
2. Recently, in both Crypto and traditional stocks, we've seen the power of network effects from investors turning into users and vice versa.  Being on Coinbase will allow ICX the best chance to tap into this network effect.  The more connected/seasoned investors investing in ICX will mean they push for more development on the Icon Network either through their own companies or companies they invest in.  Given the Icon network is both mainstream and commercial facing, onboarding the most of amount of mainstream and institutional investors is critical at this juncture of development.

The Rosetta implementation is a step in the right direction.  I don't know what to say to the comment that ICON hasn't even applied to be on Coinbase.  If it is true, I would be absolutely shocked and it would truly show there is no one at the helm of this ship.  I hope that is not the case.  If $50mm custody is the last hurdle to a Coinbase listing, I'm sure large vested investors can help out.

Regardless of what happens, thank you for this post - I hope it continues to stoke awareness and discussion.",user_1950,https://www.reddit.com/r/helloicon/comments/ktnz3q/the_coinbase_situation_why_its_important_icons/,"The Coinbase Situation: Why it's important, ICON's current position, and what we can do to help"

3975,2021-01-10 20:10:08,"After a really good read, really I’m happy you see the most important things that matter more than the wealth you may have achieved and that you have a balanced approach with a similar midfullness to lifestyle importance, to me its super important that we should follow our heart and learn real love !! For me it’s absolutely impossible until you find the love for oneself first,  then you will free yourself from something intangible, when you do this your world will change, it’s probably different for everyone and may change your course in life dramatically, Now let’s get right back to bitcoin and alts and me,,,,
I am 55 got into crypto back in 2016 and missed a customer/friends advice to buy at around $ 300 as i knew nothing about values except what one coin for $ 300  I had £3000 to invest and did not do it .he said he was owed millions from America so I believe he was in mt gox 
So I ended up getting into the scene buying shitcoins like xvg, and the likes xrp etc, I still did not understand but started to realise this Crypto blockchain was the  future whatever the price change, I then hit the jackpot when xvg pumped and sold half way to its top, then sold the Etn ico lol made 7 k there, I then played at the game buying selling making and loosing, I ended up holding one btc at a cost of $10k, also 15 Ethereum, 34 ltc, and a good few shitcoins  now lost to Cryptopia lol, pac coin amongst them.
So I switched off from the big crash and against my wife’s wishes I said I’m hanging onto the bags for another cycle,.
Back in March in I saw the signal to buy again  but “wifey” got the better of me “she holds the purse strings” we will move on from that to early December I saw it had hit 16k, begged her  and won so we bought 1 bitcoin, told a few people to get In onThis as it’s the bull cycle etc, no one listened, then I saw Ethereum is undervalued so begged and begged at 695 managed to get my son to buy 15 and I bought 45 lol, that’s it, so now we are up and hoping this bull cycle is only 1/3 through, I also started margin trading and to be honest it’s a hard one as it takes a lot of my time and it’s not healthy with the family. I have a business and due to covid have retired from it and let the managers run it.
I’m also  a biohacker in the last 5 years and luckily have gone through the revolution of taking your life/ health matters into your own hands, this one thing has been more important to me than any other thing, I would really urge anyone who is not finding happiness to try and understand the power of belief, there only two people that helped me with this that is dr jo dispensa and Bruce Lipton, listen to them for a good few weeks and it should change your life forever!!! 
Right where is the market going, I believe we are never going back down like previous, it’s obvious and I do not need to explain this, my question is do I ever sell even at 100k - 200k and Ethereum at 10k, my belief is that I can borrow against the asset and never sell, especially for big items like a car, hope We are all making sure we realise we are still in the 0.2% If we hold crypto right now and that we may be in an elite class one day if we hold 1/2 to one bitcoin. I think the hedge fund sharks have been allowed to use teeth in this game, dont be bitten and pushed off your holdings, expect dips with a quick return up as that’s  the signal they are looking  to frenzy feed on the retail small stop loss  traders that loose thier positions I would not take a stop loss for a trade if in btc right now as they know exactly what you guys are doing and can cause the dominoes effect then once you get liquidated they are mopping up your blood!!! Please give me a thumbs up or down I’m not thinking what I say but typing as I think, peace love and also may you get what you want out of life !!!! Lambo or just happiness, be real and be a futuristic and live in the moment, don’t over expose yourself in this market",jmanjis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ku9yjr/in_2017_i_sold_100_btc_and_bch_for_15m_dollars/,In 2017 I sold 100 BTC (and BCH) for 1.5M dollars USD – Some thoughts

3984,2021-01-11 00:16:29,"Sunk Cost Fallacy

That's all that needed to be said. 1.5m was life changing to you and you secured your future. There was no missing out. You couldn't have made that money now because you don't have the money now and that's a wasteful thought.

It's ridiculous people think like that. You don't lose out on money you ""could have had"" just like you don't lose money if you don't sell. The people saying these things are just dense.

With all of that being said, we can all expect BTC continues to grow from here. Moving large portions of an appreciating asset, especially one that's extremely appreciative, is a mistake. No one should follow what you did, not because what you did was wrong, but because BTC depreciates much, much slower than any other asset currently in existence (actually, it's none, zero).

Selling was a mistake. But, I don't blame you. Many people still don't understand why, even people that are extremely successful like you, OP.

Congrats on exiting the rat race, but you really ought to consider how you store your wealth. Fiat derivatives are a mistake. Using tax write offs is largely pointless. Storing with depreciative assets is senseless... Who am I to give you advice, though?

* How are you planning to hedge against [inflation](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/02/12/Photos/NS/MW-GD574_CPICha_20180212131601_NS.png)?

It's how I try to approach life too, and your retirement sounds wonderful and exactly the way you should do retirement. My mom retired around the same age after making more money in a few years than she had her entire career. I helped her make some good art investments while she was still making money because that's my specialty, and she's done extremely well. Example would be a painting she bought for 25k is now worth at least 350k (got an offer a year ago but passed), and is possibly more like 500k at the moment. Similarly to you, she could look back and think, ""gee, I could have worked a couple more years and bought 10 times as many paintings and had even more money"", but instead we just enjoy what she has, and it's wonderful work to live with anyway. She has a bunch more beyond that one painting, and basically all of it has seen some form of value increase.

I have had coins since 2010 but I never accumulated a huge amount...call it a failure of vision or just chalk it up to being kind of young and not really seeing what this could become.  Suffice to say I didn't have enough to cash out millions.  That said, I have 0$ in as I got all my coins mining.

I sat down and looked at what I have and how I wanted to retire and came up with a price bottom that I want to see the market hit and then I will retire and basically just sell enough each month to get my salary and cover expenses.  

Do you think there is an advantage over one method or another?

I have a plan, I don't think I am being greedy and I am still working and contributing to a 401k, I have a brokerage, an annuity based universal life insurance policy, etc etc so bitcoin has always been the plan B.

3973,2021-01-11 10:18:37,"More advice for young people....if you develop a true passion for anything and become an expert at it, you can probably get paid to do it. I love my job and don’t need the money from it to live anymore, but I will not retire until my body and brain won’t let me “work”. It isn’t a drain. It’s true passion work and I’m excited each day. I love every minute of my day to day work and it brings incredible joy. Retirement is a state of mind and if you don’t want to retire, don’t. We have long surpassed the magic number to retire and yet, it would take away a huge part of my joy in living. 

Credit to the people who taught me this in high school.....don’t join the rat race. It makes no sense to me. 

In other words, unlike OP, you won’t be in the rat race to begin with and money won’t be your motivator to retire. It will be your motivator to continue your already free life all while still making contributions to the world and developing your expertise in a field you love.

6182,2021-01-11 10:32:17,"Let me play devils advocate.
As some people are aware I've battled the shills on /r/buttcoin regarding Tether for several years.

I don't like Tether, I think they are a terribly run company, I don't think anyone should use USDT. But at the same time, all of the hypothesis in which Tether is printing unbacked tokens and pumping the price of Bitcoin fail to explain how Tether manages to keep the price of their token locked to the dollar. Everyone pointing to the growth of Tether as being impossible, fails to note that their closest competitor USDC has a much better reputation and is also going parabolic in marketcap. If USDC can legitimately have 4.6 billion dollars, then it makes sense that Tether, the market leader, many years ahead in adoption, with far more trading pairs could have 20 something billion dollars (goes to check, 24 billion, holy shit.)

So this is what I think: The hypothesis that Tether is the new willy-bot is the ultimate no-coiner cope.  It's possible, sure. But it falls apart under a small amount of scrutiny. For example, it has to be the dumbest scam ever to publish how much fake money you've created on an open blockchain. Any exchange could easily do that in secret in their internal database and the Bitfinex guys have one of those too. I have yet to hear a coherent ""theory of the crime"". That explains how they've kept it going through the massive dump in crypto in 2017-2018. All the actual ponzis in the crypto space collapsed.

As to the NYAG case. I will bet that what happens on the 15th is a big let down for the buttcoiners. The actual substance of the case is about an internal loan that Tether gave Bitfinex more than a year ago. It's normal for a company to push back on regulators demanding information that they don't necessarily have a right to. But I guess we'll see in a couple days.",biglambda,https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/kupola/my_thoughts_on_the_tether_situation/,My Thoughts on the Tether Situation

6183,2021-01-11 13:45:28,"I read both r/xmrtrader and r/Buttcoin almost daily. And the Tether topic is heavily discussed on that other sub. In particular, user u/JelloSquirrel posted a nice theories recently about what could be happening.

Here is the link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kspk6n/what\_i\_think\_is\_happening\_and\_what\_is\_going\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kspk6n/what_i_think_is_happening_and_what_is_going_to/)

 And here is the TL;DR he made:

>My general thought is that right now, fake Tether is being produced and  flowing out from Binance and Huobi into other Tether exchanges and DeFi  markets in order to capture all their crypto. Additionally, some amount  of Tether and crypto from Binance is making it to Kraken and Coinbase to  cash out via fiat markets. A couple weeks ago, the ratio of Tether to  real fiat was about 4x, and now it's about 10x, effectively leveraging  up the entire crypto market place, except about 90% of the cash is  (likely) to be worthless in the near future, as exchanges around the  world become increasingly liable for money laundering and unbacked  Tether due to changing laws around the world.

&#x200B;

I may not agree about everything he said (like then why the Tether price on the Kraken USDT\_USD pair is in average always higher than 1USD/USDT). But his analysis makes use of tools I did not know existed, that show how the cryptos are flowing in between exchanges, and the recent balances of cryptos for each exchanges. Very neat!

It was a miracle, the trades didn't incur much loss but I spent way too much time thinking about how to roll; how to adjust etc to scratch these calls. What adjustment strategy has worked for you when your short calls/puts are in significant loss? Do you ever hold your positions after expiry when they are ITM e.g. either take the loss or sell when Calls are ITM or long when Puts are ITM? If selling SPY puts wiped out your account (BTC & ETH IVs are MUCH higher and the weeklies gamma risks are a killer),  I assume you are managing the risks of your short options trades somehow.",dEDg3AFQar,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/l47cm1/weekly_bitcoin_ethereum_options_trading_series_2/,Weekly Bitcoin / Ethereum Options Trading Series #2

Investing only what you can afford to lose makes sure that in cases like DOGE, you have protected yourself from the pump and dump, and you haven’t just lost rent/mortgage money and you’ll be in debt because of it.

Get yourself a notebook read up on projects, watch video from team devs, and not from shills, look at pros and cons. I personally spend around 10-20 hours on learning each project and even that doesn’t give you a full working knowledge of a project!!

Yea, centralized exchanges absolutely can do that and have done so in the past. Just the other day Independent Reserve delisted BSV. Some Dutch exchange blocked a currency from being withdrawn from their platform a couple of weeks ago. Remember the Bitgrail fiasco.  
Decentralized exchanges are a different matter, but you're talking to people who want an easy to use mobile app like Robinhood where they can spend fiat.

You stated that to trade crypto you need an exchange app as well as a wallet. I see that Binance has an internal wallet integrated in their app and Coinbase says that you can hold all your crypto directly in the app itself. Is this a smart move or is it better to separate the two?

3933,2021-02-01 20:21:18,"Hi - I'm looking for some advice on getting set up if possible! 

After doing alot of reading I'd just like to clarify a few things.  Coinbase and Binance seem to be the most popular exchanges - but act as an online based wallet also?  Is a wallet in coinbase more or less secure than a wallet in Exodus?  Also, how do the transaction fees work?  Are they specific to apps such as Exodus i.e. do exodus set their own price for transactions?  Are there other places to get a wallet that doesn't have fees or have cheaper fees?  Or are these just standard fee's relating to each individual coin type?

Cold storage seems to be the best way and is definitely something im going to look into asap.

Pretty sure I know the answer to this, but again just want to be sure! Basically as long as I know my keys and password I can view my wallet on any device any number of times I want.  And it can always be recovered (if I forget my password) by using the seed phrase?

Any help will be much appreciated!

3579,2021-02-03 14:02:18,"I think your analysis of what happened is very sound.  About the future, somewhat less so, just because if marketcap is shaved off of some of the bigger coins, DOGE has a lot of competition.  Consider this in terms of stepwise motion: for DOGE to reach $1, every cent represents a step up of $1.28 billion in its marketcap.  It is VERY IMPRESSIVE that DOGE made that kind of transition to get to where it is, but, there are small coins with more known utility for which each of those stair steps represents a 10X, period.  

This is not to say that Doge cannot achieve all of its stair steps to $1, given long enough -- in a bull run of 12-18 months, it is certainly not impossible.  We have established that several million of us like the coin, so there is a base, BUT, DOGE has to find a way to beat out very serious competitors in order to capture the equivalent of $8-11 billion in marketcap a month.  Make it even two years: to get to $1, DOGE still has to find about $530 million in marketcap a month because the developers are refusing to cap the supply.  In the interim, some strong case has to be made about why DOGE should be the beneficiary of other coins not doing as well, in the midst of competitors whose marketcaps can do higher multiples with the same amount of money.",General_Awareness535,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lbi8h9/the_doge_pump_heres_what_happened_and_whats_next/,The DOGE Pump - Here's what Happened... and Whats Next.

People buy Doge at inflated prices, like the bought XRP at inflated prices, and the people behind it cash in massive, huge profits. In some months when Doge is at 0.01 people will ask ? Where is the big pump? Reply, same as XRP, well, it WAS the big pump and dump, sorry guys.

I can't say I agree with your conclusion re holding, whales don't care if you buy, sell or hold in the immediate aftermath of a pump, but it's nice to see a thread actually explaining the basic premise to people gain traction.

I'd note that if anything the instigators of this are likely still selling their DOGE, they're also likely behind all the alt accounts spamming memes and ""HODL"" nonsense. It's in their best interests to try and dump as much as of their DOGE as possible whilst the price is inflated.

I don't know how many times I have read and written to not try to time the market.

You didn't read it or didn't listen.

Nowadays I even have to defend 'not your keys not your coins' since some have lost their seed, so keeping your coins at exchanges is safer...

We can lead a horse to the water, but letting it drink is another matter.

Good luck recovering, stick to your original plan and hodl it in Bitcoin, can't give guarantees but I'm pretty sure you will be in the green before the end of the year.

If you are in it for the long term, wait for the retraction after the blown off top somewhere end of this year or in 2022.

Than slowly keep dca, sit out the next run in 4 years time and if you can fulfill some dreams cash out some..",Btcyoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lbo7zw/how_and_why_i_threw_my_hodl_strategy_out_the/,How and why I threw my HODL strategy out the window and fell for a pump & dump scheme

3556,2021-02-03 20:09:55,"Very cool read. Was a bit skeptical on moving some funds towards DOGE but this gives me some food for thought.   


I can remember as a younger kid listening to my neighbor tell me about this new thing called bitcoin, and how he and his friends thought it was the next big thing. I was too worried about the new call of duty at the time so I didn't listen. I don't have contact with him anymore, but i do recall the figures those days being sub $400.. hope he held.   


Point is, for a relatively small investment in this coin, you could potentially see a massive return. That is enticing enough for me, but I would tell everyone else who is interested - make sure whatever money you put in it, you would be ready to lose in a worst case scenario.

4727,2021-02-03 22:54:50,"We’ve all been there. 2018 I went from $3400 to $35000 back down to 150$. These coins are only worth what people will buy them for, they aren’t attached to companies as voting shares or something. So yes they can go down 99.99% very quickly. And something to watch out for is what the circulation supply is compared to the max supply. If some project is shilling their coin but the Max supply is like 80% more than the circulation supply(similar to XRP) you know that the project has a bunch of coins they plan on dumping on the market, some people don’t realize that when a project does this project is literally taking money out of the persons portfolio and profiting off it. I’ve seen people defending projects with all of their time and energy while the project t literally steals from them, just because they don’t understand how it works. Unless there is a VERY strict governance like Bitcoin about how quickly coins are released into circulation you have to be suspect of this.

These are all things you have to watch out for. 

Gamblers don’t just learn. You sound like a gambler. You had a plan and you threw it out the window relatively quickly. I think you need to go to a gamblers anonymous meeting to see what that’s all about.

I hodled my account from 12K to 60k USD, caught the xrp pump in December and hit almost 100k. Then the 2018 alt crash began and I decided I was a good enough trader to make money on the dips. Proceeded to bleed away more than half of my gains throughout the bear cycle, and then learned about shorting and leverage right around the time bitcoin had bottomed out. So I proceeded to lose more money on bitmex not understanding just how bad my thought process was.

Despite some decent gains so far this cycle I'm still far off from where I could have been had I just held.

4751,2021-02-04 10:02:30,"Are you from the US? Trading like this makes 0 sense to me. 

You’re capped at 3k losses a year for offsetting cap gains, after that you’re paying cap gains on everything that was profitable. 

Buying with btc / cashing out in btc doesn’t help your cause either. 

BTC ratio can remain the same upon entry and exit of trade, but if you cash out an alt for an equivalent amount of BTC that is *worth more in USD value* upon exit, and if you then sell that BTC for USD, then you’re in for a very rough ride come tax season... All your “profits” are goin towards taxes at that point - even if you didn’t gain/lose any Satoshis. 

BTC to ALT buy is taxable, calculated by your USD sale value of BTC (at time of trade) for an ALT with xyz USD value; ALT to BTC sale is taxable, you’re locking alt gains/loses into BTC, BTC value is based on BTC/USD price at time of trade, not the amount of satoshis lost/gained; To cap it off, USD gains/losses from your last BTC to USD sale will be calculated based on the USD value you gained/lost on BTC after selling your alts into it. 

This is the easiest, and most unforeseen, way new crypto traders lose *substantial* amounts of USD. 

Take crypto to crypto trading more seriously next time - taxes on those transactions are  convoluted/flawed, and you can certainly get fucked by the IRS if you aren’t careful.

I understand more dogecoins are created/released each year to combat deflation and lack of availability.  However, is this done off of a percentage of current circulated coins?  Is this done as a constant each year?  Is the goal to have X amount amount of dogecoins in circulation? Or is the goal simply to ADD X amount of dogecoins each year?

Hopefully what I'm asking makes sense.  I can't understand how any asset is meant to hold it's value over time if it's designed to increase at a constant.

Maybe Dan leaving was good for EOS because the big powers just realized how EOS is cool and will play big part of their plans then they will just change the focal points in block one to make sure they comply with their goals 100% ..

5330,2021-02-05 02:07:49,"Totally agree. There's something extremely weird going on with EOS. 
XRP had the 'flatline syndrome' because they kept dumping more and more on the market but even XRP has it's up swings every once in a while. 

I've done a shit ton of digging around for EOS but have yet to find a reason why its been stuck in this region for over 300 days... 
I just can't seem to find the answer aside of all the missed deadlines, mess ups etc but if you look at it pure chart wise though it should at least start to give a kick here and there, it's in the perfect place to go out on a tear! 

It's like you said, it feels like there's a big entity out there that is satisfied with trading 1-3 % moves which is stupid because if they would just nudge a bit all TA dudes will come pilling in and this thing will liftoff and perhaps spark more interest from devs and people yet they just keep it going sideways and in doing so lose all bullish momentum and basically just flatlines EOS into nothing.

Coins that have we haven't even heard about or don't even have a working website or project at least follow the market a bit yet EOS completely ignores everything except a general market move to the downside.

Another thing is that the EOS blockchain really lacks marketing and leadership. Someone or some team needs to step up and step it up professionally, not a (don't take this the wrong way if the one reading this is a) random youtube guy in his bedroom talking about EOS , it isn't Brendan as he is leaving it to the community and Dan is gone, EOS is basically faceless atm.",NivekIyak,https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/lcnmzp/even_xrp_with_all_its_problems_is_overperforming/,"Even XRP, with all it's problems, is overperforming EOS"

1814,2021-02-05 23:16:48,"Hey everyone,  I did some math. Let me set the stage first.

Chun Wang (CEO of F2Pool) tweeted that he sold off 10k bitcoin and that they (presumably) had a total of 1,000,000 BTC. So, if they had a maximum of 1m BTC (which I think is actually overestimated), then they have sold (or moved) 12.5% of their BTC in the last 20 days. Yes, that is 125k BTC.

They are selling at a nominal rate of more than 6k per day.

This gives them a \*maximum\* runway of 160 days from the day they started dumping or 140 days from today if they keep this pace. That means, according to my rough math, they will be out of bitcoin on June 24th - which happens to be my birthday.",Adamsimecka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l9a1lx/my_theory_f2pool_stabilizes_btc_price_till_they/,My theory: F2Pool stabilizes BTC price till they run out of BTC.

It is possible for G0LDM4N_S4CHS to use “buy when ~~its~~ [**it's**] below 2x” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

You need something inflationary to actually perform transactions and be viable for a means of exchange. I would argue that Doge is more viable for means of exchange, whereas Bitcoin is kind of like a commodity that rises in value because of scarcity.

It's crazy to see this jump to where we are. After being in and out and in for years it is totally not what Doge has been doing. It seems very fake and manipulated to me like you pointed out. I even said this to a buddy after the first jump on January 1st and the days afterwards.  It wasn't like the tiktok jump in July where it jumped and then fell off quickly this one was weird and the way it just slowly went back down seemed manipulated. I sure wasn't expecting what happened on the 27th or whenever that was when they shutdown robinhood.  It went up so quickly.  It was unbelievable.  Then quickly started to dwindle. Then came the Musk tweets several times and here we are. It seems like he has a hand in all this. Especially from his mid December tweet. It was like a signal to be ready...

How far back do you think this goes? 

How it dropped back to .0073 and jumped to where we are is insane. The slow down it is experiencing now the past day is scary. I feel bad for large bag holders if it doesn't keep going up.

***If you ware watching the crypto's price chart, i.e. doge, you may notice that there are 0.001(+/-) selling and buying occurring. If you are wondering what this could mean, simple. It's possible newer coins are being added, it's a small correction, or whales are trying to trigger a panic sale.***

If it's a whale, guarantee they will buy back all their shares. And if they are trying to trigger panic sales so that they have a newer low buy-in, then in the long run, they will only hurt their income because they have to keep doing that.

***A lot of stocks and commodities are going through risk. So, just look away from your phone, because .08 cents could be the new floor. If you are tempted to buy, than feel free to do so, buy as low as you can.***

***With that being said, this is a clear sign of stability and high growth potential. We are the underdoge, and we will send doge beyond the moon. HODL*** 💎🐾🐕🚀🌕",ItachiUchia003,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lc17m9/misconceptions_regarding_dogecoin/,Misconceptions regarding Dogecoin

5657,2021-02-10 17:09:29,"Great Post, looking at the graph I'm guessing that a lot of folks time their entry into bitcoin and their exit. Surely that would explain the spike and the dip right? I'm sure the community has some real hardcore Hodlers but that kind of fluctuation suggests that there's also a healthy amount of speculators.

While such volatile swings may be daunting for the newbie joining the hype train, wouldn't it be also true to say newbies could take advantage of this fluctuation? If they can properly time it that is. If what you say is correct that a spike is to follow roughly a year after a halvening then we are due for a spike and then a dip at (roughly?) six months after the new ATH which would bring the price back down to somewhere near the pre-spike price?

5651,2021-02-10 21:09:18,"12, 16, 20, 24. These are the years of the halvening. So far the spikes have occurred on the latter half of the next year. 13, 17, respectively. Then BTC fell to about one-fifth of the high.


If this pattern continues then we could see up to 400,000$ per btc by the end of the year and then a fall to 80,000$ per btc in 2022.

Some things that may complicate this is large investments by corporations may cause the spike early. Maybe they see the pattern too.

There is also a major market correction predicted later this year. Cathy Woods called it a ""doozey"".  This could cause a divestment of btc for folks covering margin or bargain hunting. It could trigger the dip early or cause a false dip that rebounds until the real dip next year.

Finally, if the dollar collapses then all models are out the window because people will pour their paper money into crypto as a hedge against inflation and that will drive the price up more than anyone can predict.

So then, I think buying in at 47k is okay if it spikes the same 20x as twice before. 47k is less that the one-fifth drop we've seen twice before.",Bull_Winkle69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lgp8ke/tips_for_newbies/,Tips for Newbies

With new investors comes new possible highs, we really can't say how high a coin like ONE could go at the moment, things that seem impossible now could very much be a regularity in the coming years. Million dollar Bitcoin? Maybe. It's part of the risk.

If you check the coin market cap archived screenshots of the market in years past you'll be shocked at the prices some of your favorite coins (provided they stick around and kept growing) were trading at, and even then people figured ""no way this could get past such and such price"" people have very short memories and sell based on emotion, that's true in almost every industry, just watch stocks.

I think Elon could have pumped the market to get out, not because he was getting in. He pushed the tops a little higher and spruced up some short-term belief in the market. He possibly dumped at the top of the spike after the announcement.    
He put a decent effort into shilling doge while buying into BTC in order to redirect market share for cheaper prices, it’s not really far-fetched that he’d do the polar opposite.

1989,2021-02-15 17:48:27,"Apart from potential conspiracy theories, real answer is combination of 2 things - arbitrage and automated trading (bots/algo trading, whatever you call it). 

Very few bots actually can do this and it requires being in the same building or even on the same server as the exchange server to be able to do it, but basically imagine that at time 2:45:59:200 (200 being milliseconds) a big sell order dumps BTC price from $1000 to $800 (using these for simplicity). 

_____

So, a bot is seeing that price of BTC is $800, while price for ETH is $100 and price for BTC in ETH is 10 ETH/BTC. The bot sells my ETH for USD and buys BTC with it (thus dropping the price for ETH and bringing up the price of BTC), then sells that BTC for ETH. Let's say I sold 10 ETH at $100/ETH (let's ignore liquidity at that moment for simplicity), got $1000, then bought 1.25 BTC with it ($1000/$800/BTC). Then, finally, I can sell that BTC to buy back ETH at 10 ETH/BTC, getting 2.5 ETH extra. Everytime I sold something, I brought down it's price, everytime I bought something I brought up its price. So, reviewing my steps, first I sold ETH for USD, thus dropping the price of ETH in USD, then I bought BTC with that USD, so I increased the price of BTC in USD, then I sold BTC for ETH, bringing down the price of BTV with respect to ETH. So as a result of me doing this arbitrage, I gained 2.5 ETH, while lowering the price of BTC in ETH and increasing the price of BTC in USD and increasing the price of BTC in ETH.

_____

After I did my trade, another bot sees that the ETH for BTC costs 9 ETH/BTC, but the price for ETH is $900 (since me selling ETH for USD just a millisecond ago brought the price down), and the price for BTC is $820 (notice how it increased just a bit from my previous trades, compared to my stronger effect on ETH/BTC and ETH/USD markets). This bot has BTC and wants to accumulate it. It sells 1 BTC for 9 ETH, then sells that ETH for $900, then buys 1.097 (almost 1.1) BTC with that. In the process it increased the price of BTC in USD (just like I did before), decreased the price of ETH in USD (just like I did before) and decreased the price of BTC in ETH (OPPOSITE of what I did before). 

So, this way, we both lowered price of ETH in USD, increased the price of BTC in USD and balanced each other's impact on price of BTC in ETH (or ETH in BTC).

_____

Lastly third bot who holds USD and wants to increase its amount simply buys BTC, sells that for ETH, then sells ETH for USD.

All 3 bots are getting gains while making the price of ETH in USD dump and price of BTC in USD go back up, until they find balance again. 


_____


That's what you see on the market - if someone dumps BTC, its price in relation to other coins also decreases, and the price of other coins with respect to USD also decreases. This going back and forth until there is mo more gain in arbitrage, so all the prices are lower with relation to USD. The last thing to understand this process is that I said ""price of BTC with respect to other coins decreases"". However, this effect is rather small because BTC's volume is so big, it takes ALL other coins on arb like this, so the decrease of price of BTC with respect to an X coin is miniscule. 

If we take into account the difference in liquidity, and adjust the ratios of price changes there, then you'll see how it all comes together.

_____

Lastly, someone who wants to cash out from multiple coins into fiat would try to dump them all at the same time, so instead of giving all this sweet arb grease to the arb/algo traders, he sells his alts at the original high prices, before the bots correct those.",kid_ghibli,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk6sap/multiple_coins_hit_a_big_dip_all_at_841_pm_pst_why/,"Multiple coins hit a big dip, all at 8:41 pm (PST).

The real answer, more often than not, is miners. Pools who have a LOT, lot more bitcoin than anybody else, and dont particularly want the price to increase massively any time soon. It's in the best interest of the bigger pools to keep the price low to eventually punch out the little pools who dont have enough BTC to dump to cover their costs, and if they do dump it, it's going to be at a low price pretty much determined by bigger pools. The less BTC they have, and the less they get paid for it, the more likely they are to retreat from mining due to not covering costs or donate / join their hash power with the bigger pools monopoly.

I'm genuinely more worried about fear mongering causing people to liquidate on fear when it comes to the longevity of crypto. It seems odd to me that people accept that the coin can go up 10k or more in less then 24 hours but are flabbergasted when it can also do the same in the reverse, especially when those gains were practically founded on a tweet.

5170,2021-02-24 03:10:38,"I agree with the sentiment and thought process of your post. However as we are not a Bitcoin based economy, but a dollar or euro based one, looking at relative value between the two skews the picture I think. 

Consider you are comparing something with great marketing value, public acceptance and trend, to something that doesn’t have that. So assuming there will be the same acceptance and this demand, to express the two in the ratio between them is not correct. 0.004 is not the bottom because something has changed in Monero, but it’s the hype of Bitcoin that has driven it as high. 

So, as I said, I agree with your thought process and outcome, and still believe that XMR has great potential at $200, not because Bitcoin went to $50k, but because there will be increased demand for its privacy features, and this demand will drive the price, regardless of where Bitcoin lands. 

If Goldman or JPM, or whoever called BTC at $147k, that’s 300% upside after an absurd rally. That would be the same return if XMR goes to $600! The latter, I can see happening relatively quickly. The former, well it’s too high risk in my book. So I chose the XMR trade. As risk and reward curves move up together, 300% upside means you are taking some risk. So I don’t care if $200 is the bottom, or $150, or $100 for that matter.

4855,2021-02-24 08:02:36,"The XRPL could actually be argued to be quite centralized at a technical level. Every blockchain is centralized to some degree until meaningful adoption, but the XRPL is seemingly centralized at the protocol layer.

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/3/53/pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjsmve_oP7tAhVjFVkFHcxKBtEQFjACegQIERAB&usg=AOvVaw2tNb514XPWOgN084EZdvsw

*""Consensus Crash Testing""* by the University of Nicosia:

> In particular, the percentage of UNL
overlap can be considered being inversely proportional to the decentralization degree of the consensus process. **For example, a network configuration that utilizes 10% UNL overlap is more decentralized compared to the case of 90% UNL overlap.**

https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07242. *""Analysis of the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol""*, by Ethan McBorough, former Ripple Lead Engineer:

>As described in the original whitepaper [10], the
minimum overlap requirement was originally believed to be roughly 20% of the
UNL... We also show that under a more general fault model which was not considered in the original whitepaper but is canonically used in the research literature, **the minimum overlap is actually roughly > 90% of the UNL.**

In essence, it appears for the XRP ledger to remain viable all network participants must agree on which nodes get to verify all transactions (90%). That seems only slightly more decentralized than permissioned/private ledgers. 

Ripple provides a ""recommended"" list of valudators participants should trust but it seems if the network fails to follow these guidelines the entire ledger could be at risk.

Its also worth noting the conflicts that arise between XRP, the XRPL and Ripple given the for-profit status. Ripple is the chief steward of the XRPL but Ripple is also a for-profit company with an obligation to profits. Building out a ledger is not a profitable venture, Ripple needs to sell things. That is why the early years of Ripple was almost solely focused on creating fragmented software products to sell off to banks instead of just building out protocol features. 

A for-profit company owning the supply is also far different than a non-profit. A non-profit has zero incentive to do anything other than put that money back into the ecosystem through salaries, partnerships and so on...Ripple on the other hand could easily increase its bottom line with XRP sales, enriching shareholders or use it for ventures not even connected to the XRPL, which was arguably what it was doing in its early years. Believe it or not, Ripples priorities and the XRPLs priorities may not frequently be in line. Considering XRP effectively equals the XRPL, the fact that Ripple could sell off ""value"" from the XRPL and not necessarily even put it back in is a pretty concerning conflict of interest. For instance, what if banks approached Ripple to build a permissioned network? A for-profit isn't going to turn down an obvious path to revenue even if it means nothing for the XRPL.",TRossW18,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqzih4/for_the_newbies_a_summary_and_analysis_of_xrp_and/,For the Newbies: a summary and analysis of XRP and Ripple to help you make up your own mind...or at least better understand the controversy.

Basically my story follows yours to a tee where I didn't want to sell at such a huge loss and became numb to the dip and altogether just stopped looking at the market. Got back into checking up on the market when Bitcoin had the massive dip to 3k in 2020 (fortunately I actually bought a bit at this time) but other than that moment I wasn't active in the market much. Forward to January 2021 where I've really started following the market and tech more prominently again. With my portfolio has recovered now and even grown from my initial investments but I feel I've gained a lot going through that, I can control my fomo and fud a lot better that's for sure, something about losing 90%+ gains that just rips away those kinds of emotions. Basically now have learned not to lose faith in this new burgeoning industry, things will go up and things will go down, the industry is young so anyone investing even now can count themselves lucky because the vast majority of the world aren't even aware of cryptocurrencies yet.

Now I read up on a bunch of new cryptos regularly and try to be more informed about what's going on.

3503,2021-03-03 02:14:46,"With Strike and LN, not to mention wrapping coins on other chains, I expect second layer transactions will become scalable at some point in the future. Given this, I think it is actually nuts that people plan on pulling out of BTC. If you don't believe in the project's long-term viability, sure that makes sense... but if you do believe in it... what are you even thinking?

There was a time where hodl didn't just mean *""oh I'll pull out when moon $$$""*. It meant actually **HODL**. Keep it. Don't let go. Bitcoin has already  achieved viability as a store of value. MicroStrategy is just the forerunner among institutions planning on holding Bitcoin. Many thought the ""store of value"" claim was a death knell for Bitcoin only four years ago. Well, it is 2021 and Bitcoin is fine. Additionally, second layer projects are doing fine. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin won't scale hasn't been paying attention, or simply doesn't believe in Bitcoin's future. If scaling didn't happen the way you expect, or as fast as you hoped, at least recognize it is happening.

If you want to recoup your initial investment, crystalize gains, or anything like that, go nuts. You can be a responsible investor while still hodling long-term... but if you are in crypto and don't understand what you've invested in, maybe it's time to learn. Planning to cash out at an arbitrary level that satisfies your greed is both poor investing and very naïve.

You want a market with commodities that go through explosive volatility netting you 2000% gains in the next five years? Maybe buy some crypto company's stock. Lots of mining companies are still small cap. This isn't financial advice. This is just my hot take. Hodl like the enthusiasts of 2017 and earlier. DYOR and learn what success looks like for Bitcoin, and other crypto. To quote an old meme:

**I can't trust large corporations to have my best interest in mind** \- you mean like the large Bitcoin corporations? Chainanalysis sneaking in you privacy? That is true.

**I can't trust police** \- eh, you will call it anyway, when you need it

**I can trust bitcoin won't break into my home and take my kids away.** Yeah Bitcoin not, but Bitcoin exposes your financial privacy to criminals who will do it instead.

**I can trust Bitcoin won't feed me propaganda.** Then the Bitcoin propaganda works.

**I can trust Bitcoin won't sell my information.** LMAOOO. Dude, by using Bitcoin you are selling your information.

**I can trust Bitcoin won't judge me based off my credit score.** Yeah, just pay the 20$ fee.

3454,2021-03-03 06:55:00,"Good and valuable things often make money. I will never see nothing wrong with making money unless it is at the clear expense of the others.

In my current country of residence, for example, physicians are looked down and even shamed for asking any kind of compensation despite it is being, you know, job. I quit the practice because it was an example of hypocrisy. ""Helping people"" honestly for me is the unintended secondary effect of doing that job. However, there are a few people that were very vocal about vaccines and spouting conspiracy theories like ""doctors are just trying to control you!!! Wake up sheeple!"" had made me *cringed* so hard to the point that I quit.

I get most of my income from freelancing working on unreasonable academic demands of resident physicians in my country of residence (unreasonable defined as 10 page of academic work, presented tomorrow and the said physician in on shift for 24 hours, when will he/she has the time to research, write, let alone make a presentation); let's just say from one perspective, I'm perpetuating the issue of academic dishonesty. Me? I think there is a profit to be made, I provide them service so that they can rest easier and treat their patient without staying up 1 month on fuckload of stimulants (surgical residents do not sleep, they fall asleep, hopefully not on the operating table).

What I am trying to say is that the things that make you money are not necessarily bad things; if you believe in the tech, just do it. Besides, if it is sounds good and reasonable, it is an opportunity. Life is too short for debating that what you choose is noble or not; not harming people is noble enough in my book.

As much as I preached being the headaches being an early adopters, there is also a risk of being a late adopter in cryptocurrency. I might say that cryptocurrency is still in the early adopter stage, but it has shown no clear signs of slowing down.",kibbles333,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lvspfa/im_not_afraid_to_admit_it/,I'm not afraid to admit it.

False. They got a small fine due to the way their redemption program was structured and the SEC told them to stop. But there's no fundamental reason they can't offer a workable and legal redemption program.

In fact, some folks were predicting that Grayscale is going to purposely engineer a premium reverse to drive it negative, then buy a bunch of their own shares, then implement a legal redemption program for massive profit. This prediction was made when the premium was still high.

I have probably invested 30-40 hours researching crypto and blockchain in the last couple months.     I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s similar to reading a foreign language.       I honestly do not understand most of what I read.   That does not mean I do not believe it’s the future and want to take advantage of it while I can.       From what my simple brain has concluded with Information that I only somewhat understand was Etheurim was my get my feet wet pick.    Can I explain why, not really.    Biggest upside with a network that can be used more broadly?     
I depend on reading what all y’all have to say.    Each and almost everyone here  has a better understanding than I.     
That doesn’t mean I don’t want to hedge my stock portfolio with crypto.   I do.    
Eth seemed like a semi safe play with the most upside.

2967,2021-03-06 23:06:55,After owning many many different coins I wished I had just bought BTC only from the beginning.  My current advice to newcomers is to imagine an amount of money you’re willing to put in.  Then buy BTC with 1/4 that amount.  Wait for a pullback or crash or whatever and when it comes put your remainder 3/4 in to BTC.  This way you’re in the market if we go to the moon and a pullback never comes and at the same time it prepares us mentally for seeing a “crash” as a buy in opportunity,I_was_bone_to_dance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lz1taw/a_beginners_guide_to_dyor_do_your_own_research/,A Beginner's Guide to DYOR (Do Your Own Research)

3013,2021-03-07 00:31:14,"My opinion on a less risky investment is too set a long term goal, ideally no shorter than 5 years. Gradually increase holdings through a Cost average approach over a period of say a year depending on the holdings desired. I wish I had have known this when first investing. It would have taken the emotion out of the equation much earlier and reduced some FOMO bad decisions. 

Just as important as Hodling is understanding where the technology is going. there is no point having 20 moon shots at $100 a pop if you don't understand the vision of the project.  Think who will benefit and to what level will institutions adapt the technology as they will hold up the system during bear markets. Blockchain is the what really excites me and I can see a future where is has widespread adaptation through smart contracts & NFT. 

Therefore projects like ETH & ADA are my favorites followed by what I think as safe bets like BTC & LTC as they are already kinda mainstream. Finally its nice to have a few long shots to make things abit more interesting. I like XMR & NANO as they both have great working products just waiting for the mainstream to swoop it up. 

Most important, don't trust strangers and hype men when it comes to a project.

Isn't price influenced by more factors like volume of trades, who gets in to back it up, or what else have we ... because i failed to understand how does a fully diluted market cap tell the price story? 

Let's say you have dunno, i'll use XLM for example, you have this Alt at 0.4 dollars , with a 45% supply in circulation ... now the Spectacular tool our colleague did tells us if the total supply would be in circulation , don't forget, Mcap=price x supply in circulation, the cap Price would be arround 20 bucks , but i fail to understand how does the Total Supply into circulation limit the price in any way shape or form? ... I mean, can't the price be at one point , 40 dollars per token for example? So the total supply is already in circulation,  the model actually tells us that there is no way a XLM would be able to pass 20 dollar/coin but i simply don't understand how can supply tell the story of price alone !? By all means it simply doesn't ... there are way more external factors that drive the price up no matter how much supply is in circulation. 

If i use this alone it means DoT has reached price cap at 40 dollars ... so there is no point to Ever Buy DOT, right? since it's already at 33.

This is a pretty nit-picky definition, IMO. Bitcoin/ETH miners all run full nodes. There's really no point in spending all that energy mining if you're trusting someone else to validate the blocks. The same will go for POS projects. While the incentive isn't literally ""get paid to run a node"", the incentives align so that you are getting paid, and as a result you're incentivized to run a node.

5047,2021-03-08 07:31:57,"I think the issue centers around the scalability trilemma as presented by Nakamoto consensus advocates. It is assumes one area can only be improved upon as a comparative advantage where other areas get worse. They don't consider a system may have an [absolute advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage).

There is no proof that Nakamoto consensus cannot be improved upon in every metric. A counter-example shows that there are systems at an absolute disadvantage to Nakamoto consensus so it is reasonable to question their assumption and consider an absolute advantage.

A counterexample of an inferior system would be an excel spreadsheet on one computer, publicly writable. There is no security because anyone can write to the database in any way. It's neither scalable or decentralized because it operates on a single machine.

Most cryptocurrencies give better guarantees than this counterexample so absolute advantages happen and should be considered.",meor,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m00xdv/some_thoughts_and_a_few_nano_projects/,some thoughts and a few nano projects

How do we know they aren’t just faking us out and the next peak won’t be higher? There have been a few triangles already which we know weren’t the “main squeeze”!  I personally have a target price and a plan to sell in increments on downward movement. Are you saying that if we “breakout” on the top side of the pendant there could “potentially” be another spike and that wasn’t actually the squeeze? I think that it’s important to really emphasize this because I can see a bunch of smooth brained apes who don’t have a clue drawing triangles all over their screen shots like your first picture thinking this is it🤦🏼‍♀️ I’m covering 10K then I’m in for whatever comes after that but I think there are some that may need a little help and encouragement along the way!

I have 2 questions. 

1. If any smooth uptick above $500 might be for Alpha, how can we differentiate the uptick for Alpha triangle if we expect $10K+ for the price? At $800 price +$2K smooth uptick might already feel large enough to fee like Alpha, without suspecting there might be another one for +$8K. Or even +$100K if it goes there. Is there any way to differentiate between those smooth very large upticks?
2. If we saw frequent halts for raising from $40 to $90 is that even possible to reach $10k, $50K, $100K or more? Would not it take forever to reach numbers this high?

1542,2021-03-08 14:55:32,"\*Alarm alarm\* Potential HF intern shill detected. Shill strategy of the weeekend/week: talk about super low exit strategies to convince people to sell early.

Some bits of interesting info (charts from previous squeezes), intermixed with hocus pocus bs (technical analysis) and the give-away: ""we'll probably have some 200 USD wedges and then a peak to at least 500 USD higher"".

Very subtle. Very bs. Why where price targets mentioned at all to make the point? Why such extremely low price targets? We're talking about a squeeze that will make the VW squeeze look like an ant. With $GME we're talking > 100% of the float shorted. Something that has most likely never happened before and will never happen again. Why mention 200 and 500?

I won't go looking for patterns, I've been trading long enough to know that all TA is absolute total utter speudo-scientific soothsayer horsesh\*t. What I'll do is: buy. hold. sell whenever I feel like I have enough tendies. And I do know that that is going to be a couple orders of magnitude higher than what was mentioned in this DD. It's either that or bag-holding. I truly don't care.

&#x200B;

This is about how my 20+ year trading insights have evolved:

Beginner trader: buy. hold.

Experienced trader: draw patterns, study charts, study news, create back tests, write quant algorithm trading bots. Fool yourself.

Expert trader: buy. hold.

Remember: the easiest person in the world to fool is yourself.

1585,2021-03-08 15:15:59,"Thank you very much for this DD, I found it to be very helpful. What I think always needs to be stressed is the fact that every individual investor sits on an own utility function as has a very individual background when it comes to personal wealth. 

This is something that I have thinking about a lot when looking at all the VW-GME-comparisons. I think what it is important to think of is the, so to say, ""shareholder-structure"" and the wealth distribution of shareholders. What I mean by this is that it can be assumed that the shareholders in the VW squeeze will probably have been wealthier and thus more risk tolerant than shareholders in a potential GME squeeze. 

I assume that from reading in the subreddits here, a lot of low- to medium-income investors have invested in GME. In the end, I think what will also influence the hight of the squeeze is how soon the stock reaches ""life-changing-money"" for the majority of investors. This will probably be at a much earlier point relative to the VW squeeze. And I think that this is okay, because as you also put it, it will not be about ""us"" in the end, but how we individually maximize our profits. 

This does, however, not mean that the stock will not skyrocket, because of all the other parties involved. The sentiment of retail investors could thus not even matter in the end for ALPHA squeeze in the end.

1541,2021-03-08 15:29:12,You can't compare it to volkswagen because volkswagen was never 100 percent squeeze. Nothing has been 100 percent squeezed. They covered 30 percent. Then short laddered it down and people started selling thinking they missed the peak. Then they covered the other 70 percent when it dropped. Basically winning off this squeeze. We are here to kill the shorts. 100 percent squeeze = launching and not dropping back down. Remember big institutions still hold most of the stock too. So it will still end up somewhere high unless they started selling off.,Mangolorian420,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/,Exit Strategy DD: A comprehensive guide to maximizing your gains during the GME short squeeze.

1752,2021-03-09 03:06:00,"Excellent post, saved.

I read it all, I feel the need to add a note about triangles: volumes.

Volumes should start to decline from the moment triangle is forming, be very low close to the apex and then:

* increase sharply in case of a break-up
* increase in case of a breakdown, but this is not always necessary or true

Also, in case of a break-up, a second buying chance could be triggered when the price retraces back to the upper triangle line (now acting as a support) and bouncing back.

Finally: HODL.",CountGeeTee,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/,Exit Strategy DD: A comprehensive guide to maximizing your gains during the GME short squeeze. Advice from a day and swing trader.

But it makes me wish there was an app or some other tech called “whale rider” whereby I could (in the absolute laziest way possible) get access to a list of whales I could “ride” for a portion of my tendies. I could link a number or % of my held GME shares to pool with theirs. That way they get more shares, possibly at a lower cost basis for them since I got in at $45, which also gives them a larger position and power to move the price so they win. I win because I get to be lazy and I can pornhub all day without fear of not getting a seat on the rocket, since I’m much too smooth brained to know exactly when to paper hands. Plus I’m on RH and Fidelity - I’d be happy to give up half my tendies (or 25% or whatever the whale agreed to) for the comfort in knowing that Mark Cuban’s guy (for example) had an actual Bloomberg terminal and his finger on the trigger.

But don't worry, none of the exchanges or whales have ever been accused of wash trading, front running, trading against their customers, failing to fill orders, scam wicks, or spoofing the order books. 

And even if they had been accused of practices long illegal for traditional markets, they would certainly be false allegations, because these guys are of the utmost moral character.

And if by chance, there was a rare occurrence of these things, it's probably just one of the very, VERY few bad actors. I can assure you that all exchanges always do everything possible to prevent such manipulations.

770,2021-03-14 19:58:23,"I am going to say it since no one else really is...  If this is to follow the 4 year trend, then we should expect to see a large decline in a few months.  The price will then go sideways for 2-3 months and then start to slowly rise and explode.  

My concerns with this theory.  There is more institutional money in this bull run.  This may cause a buffer for hard dips in the upcoming month, but could also limit are chances of going parabolic.

I feel like to really go parabolic like in 2017 there needs to be an opportunity for people to hop in, aka Large dip and then slow steady rise. This will make buyers feel comfortable that they are not buying at the top.  

I am not selling, even though I think a large dip is coming.  I am just not sure how it will play out this year with all of the institutions involved.  I think it could cause smaller dips and smaller highs, then what we saw from the FOMO in 2017.  

The good news is that it seems to still be following right a long with the 2017 playbook and maybe my questions will prove to be invalid.

 “Our bitcoin holdings are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents

MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin.

 
We also pursue a business strategy of acquiring bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin.  We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes.

We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, though we may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate Cash Assets for treasury management purposes.”

GBTC actually had a way to redeem shares, but the SEC stopped them in 2014. They are not registered as an ETF. 

Closed-ended funds tend to trade at a discount (GBTC is a closed-end fund). This is a well studied phenomenon (known as the closed-end fund puzzle in academic circles), and you can find papers going back to the 1980s on this subject. 

GBTC is eventually bound to start trading persistently at a discount once open-end competitors emerge. It traded at a premium for years because it had no competitors. 

GBTC's recent discount is almost certainly tied to the debut of BTCC on 19 Feb (the day before GBTC premium went negative), the first North American ETF that tracks bitcoin. BTCC is an open-end fund.

Here is what was yesterday at it's wortst:

On kraken to sell off BTC to the $49k price, you would needed only $84M at some point.

Right now, is the worst price we have reached is \~53k, and to drop BTC to another 9.x% to $49k you will need ... tadam ... $174M. This is about double of the amount you have required yesterday.

In the same time you need only \~$160M to buy out BTC to the price equal to $68k and increase its price on more then 26%.

So you need 1.08x less money to increase price to \~2.8 times.

2. Go bulls. That is the dip, and whoever can invest now will profit significantly in less then a week.

Some notes (obvious ones, CO is on stage):

1. Crypto prices are volatile, you must know it and you need to have titanium balls to bear with it. \[Oh ... fcking bears here ... unintentionally\]
2. If you sell your assets at a lower price than you have bought it, - it is not an investment, it is a loss. Never sell bellow the price you've bot your assets. Just bear with lesser price for a while (might take two or more years though). Beware that the BTC and some other real cryptos are the limited resource, and deficency in its availability and difficulty of mining/purchase will increase the prices inevitably.
3. Governments of different countries, will screw you as much as they can to squeeze one more cent out of you. Governments will make anything to keep the monopoly on money which is the leverage of foolling and manipulating you. Alwasy be ready for a bad news and have an exit strategy (the sell off might be a most wrong idea here). Some good exit strategies: Change the country of residence, to one that already embrace crypto currencies or have explicit rules for thier turnover (google for the list). Lobby with your own polititians on crypto currencies rules in your country.  Lobby with your  fellow citizens on crypto currencies rules for the prosperity of you your children and your fellow citizens.",pazak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m61lxu/daily_discussion_march_16_2021/,"Daily Discussion, March 16, 2021"

Not too inclined to buy a form of cold storage also as the money would be getting too rich then, if anything I'd put more money into bitcoin for my own daughter.

3040,2021-03-16 16:05:26,"The markets are irrational, and that's why the Bitcoin price movements can't be treated as a rational, intelligent or planned process with any kind of system behind it. The market will definitely decide the value of Bitcoin, and that's how it should be. However, I'm not sure that this process protects us. Bitcoin has a long way to rise, but also a long way to fall, as it has the lion's share of crypto's market cap. As individuals we can ride it out. However, we have less influence than the likes of, say, Ark Investments. Cathie Wood has made it clear, she will not hold if the price takes a big knock. All of the big dogs have set automatic stop losses on Bitcoin. They will bail if we see another huge crash. We don't know where those stop losses are, but they will have a domino effect. If one kicks in, the price will drop disproportionately, and the others will follow. Volatility helps in the long run to stabilise at a fair market price. However, many of the little people will feel unable to hold if the price crashes following a true whale exodus. Institutions have to protect their shareholders and investors. They are not ideological. Ideological attachment combines with a lack of understanding of what Bitcoin is or what its function is, combines with a belief that people and markets are rational. This is a heady, intoxicating blend, and it should not blind us to the fact that there is this danger in Bitcoin. We are only protected if we truly can hodl no matter what. But the market doesn't care about any of us, and we can't blame anyone who bails at the first sign of trouble.",Squirida,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m65bju/bitcoins_regular_1030_corrections_ultimately/,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger"

1) Very hard to use as a currency.  There are competing cryptos that make much more sense for payments.  Cigarettes or Tide Pods make a better currency for actually buying things.

2) As a store of value it depends on the existence of a massive electronic infrastructure that is susceptible to disruption, particularly by governments looking to crack down on fraud and money laundering.  People compare BTC to gold, but even if civilization collapses almost completely, there's a good chance that gold will have value.

3) If Climate Change is ever taken seriously Bitcoin will be the first thing to be forcibly scrapped.  If Climate Change isn't taken seriously then the economic damage will probably collapse demand for something like Bitcoin, which getting back to point #1 is a currency that DOESN'T WORK AS A CURRENCY.

That is correct, without temporary retraces and cooldown periods Bitcoins growth would not be sustainable. The dips are created when BTC gets overbought, so naturally many people start taking profits, leading to a dip that is bought by the ones waiting exactly for this opportunity. The crypto market being very speculative a lot of people are buying and selling these dips and making profits from them, so the dips help the daytraders too, not just the long term investors who want to enter at a cheap price.

5011,2021-03-16 20:44:29,"The thing is, while to the outside it looks like the BTC situation is stable and the price continues rising steadily with occasional dips, in reality the situation is extremely unstable.

BTC can't gain adoption as a currency. It's useless as one due to the horrible TX capacity. This leaves only the ""store of value"" argument, which is based entirely on faith that BTC price will keep going up. Once the market mood changes and people no longer trust the price to go up, it will plummet.

>yet as the price dips and dips, it has always reached an equilibrium point where the world rushes in to buy the discount - because the world recognizes Bitcoin as a valuable and desired asset. 

This is the crux of the issue. When Bitcoin price falls, how many people rush to the exits, and how many go ""Yay, cheap Bitcoin!"" and buy BTC from the former group? (Worth noting that the latter group **only** includes people who have money or other investments - those who are already 100% BTC cannot participate.)

As long as there's this belief that the price will keep going up long-term **and** there are enough people around willing and capable to throw new money into this scheme, price drops will indeed only end up as temporary dips.

However, falling **enough** is all it takes to turn the situation around. A big enough price drop makes existing holders scared, making them dump the BTC they own. At the same time it also takes the wind out of the ""store of value"" argument (something that can drop so much is a terrible store of value) and makes it unlikely many people would be buying either - especially those who aren't already 100% BTC and **have** money to buy more. It's a vicious cycle: it simultaneously drives people into selling and reduces the number of those who would be willing to buy. In this situation the price enters free-fall and the drop accelerates itself.

And it's worth noting that out of the money flowing around in the crypto ecosystem, around $40B is Tether. It's the vast **majority** of the money that's currently being used to buy the dips. Once it loses its USD peg, there will be far less money around, which is a likely trigger for the crypto crash.

Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset even under normal circumstances and Tether makes the situation even more unstable. But crypto space actively sweeps it under the rug, in order to make cryptos look like a better investment (by hiding how dangerous the situation is and making it look like the price increase is organic, not manipulated).

This was last seen in the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2008. Banks had blind faith that housing prices would continue to climb (and they **had** been climbing nonstop for \~17 years at that point!) Due to this, they handed out mortgages to people who couldn't pay them back, since they'd be able to simply sell the house afterwards and still make profit. Handing out all these mortgages, in turn, resulted in more people buying houses, driving prices even higher. And likewise, once the crisis started, it drove prices **down** due to multiple factors (all these houses being put on sale at the same time; less mortgages being handed out; workers losing their jobs, being unable to buy houses or pay their mortgages).

There's one difference though: unlike housing, Bitcoin has **no** intrinsic value and will drop much harder.",WHY_DO_I_SHOUT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/m69of8/bitcoins_regular_1030_corrections_ultimately/,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger"

3047,2021-03-16 22:16:19,"Agree 100%. If Bitcoin didn't deflate occasionally, it WOULD become a bubble which would ultimately pop. Much rather get these deflations along the way rather than have them build up into a massive explosion later.

These corrections shake out weaker hands, allow stronger hands to accumulate, and shows everyone the next potential ATH. Then, the previous ATH ""bubble"" becomes the new support, and the cycle repeats.

3048,2021-03-16 23:24:26,"My guess is that the volatility is proportional to the difference between two different real values of bitcoin. One real value is the current utility of bitcoin, it's current network effects, it's current feature set, etc. The other real value is its future utility of bitcoin. This is where the technology is going, how big it's network will get, and how valuable that will make it. I think the volatility is so large because the current utility is so much less than the future utility. Those who don't look into the future only see the current utility and say ""it can't be worth this much, I'm selling"", but forget that market's like to try to price in the future. The people who looks to see where bitcoin is going in the next 10 years often see a future where bitcoin is widely used as a global currency, and see that the market price is nowhere near what it would be if that happened. 

The market price is somewhere in between and fluctuates down towards it's current utility and fluctuates up towards it's future utility. The volatility hasn't gone down much because the market price hasn't gotten very close to it's future utility. When that happens, we'll stop seeing these crazy swings.",fresheneesz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m65bju/bitcoins_regular_1030_corrections_ultimately/,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger"

229,2021-03-17 07:16:58,"Will the Corporate Bond Bubble Burst at 2 pm Tomorrow? 
 
This is the question I can’t stop asking myself.  
 
By implementing some alphabet soup of acronyms tomorrow, I think the probability is actually pretty high.
 
Here is my call:
 
The Fed is going to extend the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Rule to banks, which is due to expire on March 31st.  
 
This will unleash another source of demand for treasuries to try to cap treasury yields from rising.  
 
Remember that banks bought 17% of treasury issuance last year.  
 
Banks have lots of cash on their balance sheets and utilizing that as a source of demand for treasuries may counterbalance the lack of foreign buyers.
 
Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea posits that if the Fed doesn’t implement the SLR extension, another $700 billion of treasuries will need to be sold by those banks.
 
That’s not likely to happen, unless Jay is feeling frisky and wants free markets again.

If we get this type of MMT/YCC, the US dollar would likely fall while oil would spike higher as the money printer goes “Brrrr.”
 
The investment-grade corporate bond bubble may burst as inflation goes into overdrive. 
 
This would single handedly make the 60:40 portfolio obsolete, and bitcoin would consequently moon again.  
 
Be long volatility!

I share some of your concerns, I had a lengthy discussion with HUT8 IR over corporate image, tweets, press releases, Bitfarm exchanges etc.
In simple terms they acknowledged crossing the line and foal play is some cases; as they want to improve shareholders engagement without looking at it from global investors view. The fact that you can reach to IR easily was very comforting and their ability to acknowledge some mistakes was another reason to stick longer.

Regarding other concerns, I believe most of it were addressed by CEO recent podcasts interviews (around 3) thus I urge you to look at it.

I just wanted to give my take on some of our concerns since I am in the same situation as you are right now, (entry point and investment):

1. yeah, it sucks that the price is not going up, especially with BTC going up. But this is also happening to Bitfarms, it's not a HUT8 thing and does not tell you that the company has no potential. Also when I look on the socials like youtube, I don't see any ""hype"" YouTubers talking about HUT8 (yet), which tells me that there is a lot of upsides left. (i hope financials or NASDAQ will get their attention).
2. About the twitter thing, yeah it looks kinda desperate. But HUT8 has been neglecting exposure for a very long time. I think they got a wake-up call from what happened to Argo with their PR. It's not perfect at all, but at least they are trying to get themselves out there in the world.
3. I was also disappointed about their disclosed hash rate not going up and I don't think it will go up by much (in the next 6 months), why? Jaime talked about it in the interview with Curtis Lucas(painful to watch yeah, but I love the dude and I set through it). She described how it was in the bear market, how everyone died who overextended themselves on hash rate in 2017 and how hash power has the most value at the beginning of a bull market. (hinds why HUT8 had the most hash rate at the start of the bull market). They are looking very long-term, although I don't like it right now, I think they might be right. Miners are VERY expensive right now and their returns might fall off fast in the future. I think that they are waiting for the next bear market, go all out on miners and repeat.
4. My personal take is that the stock has the best risk/reward value of the miners right now, (that's not the best returns but the most consistent). It's a stock for the long run.",HoldTheDoorGME,https://www.reddit.com/r/hut8/comments/m6pmx1/this_post_includes_some_criticism_about_hut8/,This post includes some criticism about hut8!

-Their whole business model assumes a bear market is coming. If this doesn't happen then they're at a big disadvantage.

-The Nasdaq uplisting, if this doesn't happen we've picked the wrong stock. They've hinted on their twitter that an uplisting is in the works but I'm still skeptical this. I listened to an interview with the ceo and she said that the shareholders should be happy that Bitfury are dumping shares because we've been crying out for liquidity.

4950,2021-03-17 20:33:38,"Thank you everyone for comments. First of all if i didn't like the stock fundamentally i wouldn't invest in as i shared my portfolio on here recently.i believed in hut and invested heavily.  I laughed at some comments like ""please sell your shares i can buy tomorrow "" . You can buy shares if you want to buy anytime especially now since we are under $10 . That user probably has 100 shares invested in hut 8 or he/she might be working for company.  I didn't say that I'll sell the shares right away but I'll at the end of the month if it's not uplisted to Nasdaq. 

We all waiting ER to come out and hoping that will be huge catalyst . But so far all companies that i invested ,shares dropped after they released a good ER (as we all expecting/hoping it will be good). Some of you has good points for sure . That was my intention to get different opinions . 

Sue tweeted back in January saying we will get real loud soon implying( or we all took it that way ) when Nasdaq rumors were around. Then week later we all found out bitfurry is dumping shares. That day we seen significant drop on share price . Sue got them corrected New release selling vs transferring which i think the same meaning.  Bitfurry has been partner with Hut8 for long time (Some of you said bitfurry played a big role on Hut success in regards to chips and strategy). But they couldn't wait to sell or transfer whatever you want to name it when crypto stocks were hot and has huge upside potential.  Yet we retail investors being told repeatedly #hodlthehut. We retailers has thousands of shares  where as their partner (bitfurry)holds millions. So we get to  hodl while their partner dumping. I don't know.... it just doesn't make sense to me in any way.

Hut future looks bright however there are some pieces missing if you know what i mean. And I'm not expecting or wanting this to jump $100 then drop it $20 either. But failed to keep gains over the time worries me to be honest. Because we don't go up when btc is up ,but we got smashed when btc drops like 3-4K. Regardless  if Hut8 doesn't uplist to Nasdaq (sorry to say this) ,Hut is not a good company to invest ! What will happen if btc tanks like 2017?

Yes, a bear market will happen and shaking out those weak hands is a good thing. We'll end up with more hodlers in the end making Bitcoin more valuable and more stable in the long run. You just don't want to be one of the people forced to sell at a loss because you invested emotionally. 

It's also very possible that we'll see a super cycle, meaning a short bear market of maybe a year before we see another large move to the upside. This is because the ratio between hodlers (institutions, long-term buyers, bitcoin-believers) and weak handed retail is leaning more and more to the hodler side causing less selling in a bear market and more buying as well.

The question is what the bear market will look like and when exactly it’s coming. Will we see a parabolic leap to a 100-300k Bitcoin followed by a euphoric alt season where every stupid coin jumps 100x in value just because it’s crypto, followed by a rapid 90% drop in the market that ruins everybody? Or will the way up and the way down look unrecognizably different and everybody is going to miss it? And maybe these slow bleeding dips are actually what the crash looks like when there’s big money support levels.

Everyone wants to magically predict the crash so they can get out with profit before it happens, but nobody knows if this is the crash today and it’s just slower because of all that institutional money, or if we’re going to see a 100k Bitcoin next week and selling then is too early because you’d miss the 300k Bitcoin the week after, and the crash will be more gentle and settle around 50% while we all hodl in profit.",Tritador,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbaofc/there_will_be_a_next_bear_market/,There will be a next bear market.

The last bull run in 2017 if memory serves me lasted about 7-8 months. This is from when BTC started to rise, kept rising, then hit it's ATH.... 8 months.

So let's assume that this bull run is going to last a similar amount of time, that takes us to christmas and slightly beyond.

We'll see the same ""peeps buying xmas pressies with BTC"" from BTC maxis, but what we won't really hear is the fundamental utility adoption going on for other cryptos. Everyone will be shouting because ""omg, i'm rich"", and then we'll hit the bear market, again, for years.

However, when we recover, BTC won't have as big a share of the overall market of cryptos as it has in the past. At this point, I would've thought several cryptos will be used in live environments with actual utility, and those tokens will fly much much higher in the next bull run, and they'll also eat up Bitcoin's market share.",TimsKillerRabbit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbaofc/there_will_be_a_next_bear_market/,There will be a next bear market.

Do you not see the problem with a company having fixed costs attempting to speculate long term on a handful of assets you think are due for potentially for a multi-year low?

these ""institutional investors"" aren't random individuals who can afford to be down 60% for 3 years in hopes that they make their money back. They have fixed costs and a fiduciary duty to shareholders.

What happens when the amount that these institutions needs to sell to cover their fixed costs, ends up reducing the price in a low-demand bear market, which lowers the value of their positions even further that means they have to sell even more to cover their fixed costs the next month, quarter, year?",suninabox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbaofc/there_will_be_a_next_bear_market/,There will be a next bear market.

2231,2021-03-24 03:28:52,"I bought Litecoin the day before the December 2017 crash. I held it until this January, then dumped it.

Obvs I'm still in the game since I'm posting here, but I've dropped all my Litecoin in favor of a bunch of other coins 

My point is, sometimes it ISN'T worth to HODL. Sometimes you SHOULD just cut your losses, because sometimes that coin specifically doesn't recover, even if the market as a whole does. HODLing forever is not a solution unless you've diversified in coins that you truly believe will be adopted. I thought Litecoin had that chance, and in over 3 years it never panned out and I lost 50%.

3737,2021-03-24 05:00:24,"Been an ela believer since 2018. Price has been suppressed by bots in huobi for years and now that resistance has been broken, so much upside . What do u look for in a moonshot? 6 points for consideration. 

1. Legitimacy - so many rugpulls DeFi projects and meme coins nowadays. It's all about buy and sell before you get dumped on. For elastos, it has been around for a few years and got invited by WEF to join as partner last dec. Only two other projects can boast about this. One of them is hedera HBAR.

2. Team - Founder Rong Chen is a OS veteran, having worked under bill gates. Co-founder Han Feng is a respectable authority figure in blockchain academia space and has connections to MIT, huobi, alibaba etc. On the western side of things we have donald bullers who has done a great job in spreading the word on data ownership. Several clubhouse sessions were held with influential ppl like Brittany Kaiser.

3. Development - has one of the top activity in Github. Recently revealed that the elastOS foundation has 1000 btc left for development which could last for years

4. Competition - honestly, when it comes to decentralised internet, no one else even come close to achieving what elastos has. Chain is secured by a hybrid of merged mining with btc(even CZ gets ela from btc mining) and decentralised POS through node voting. For scalability, there are side chains where eth and neo are already integrated.

5. Use case - in the current world, data ownership and decentralisation is getting traction. Elastos rolled out early release for Decentralised whatsapp(hyper) , decentralised twitter(feeds) and decentralised linkedin(profile). Check those out in google play and apple store 

6. Tokenomics - recently passed a community proposal on deflation, similar to btc. Scarcity will bring the price up.

I could go on but please join the telegram group to understand more if you are not convinced. Not gonna lie, it had been tough for us OG hodlers the last couple of years when we saw other projects skyrocketing purely based on hype and not tech. However we stuck around because of this vision and the tech progress that never stopped.

Some points and tips while we are in the same boat. 

First and foremost get a good portfolio app. I use Coinbase (for staking) and Coinbase pro. 
I use CoinStats and Delta to track my portfolio. Both are good with just the basic free app. 

I started out with a similar strategy of diversification mostly evenly with slightly greater weight on mainstream coins like BTC and ETH. Quickly found my portfolio growing more lopsided with certain coins. Next investment drop I adopted a 1,3,5 strategy. 
0-1% in negative gaining coins, 3% additional to 0-15% increase coins. 5% additional to 15% increase coins. 

Very happy with portfolio. Also got some coins specifically just for their staking. 

Also got caught up in the ADA mess and massacre. I DCAed out well before it current lows and hold a much smaller amount now. If you’re holding still then it probably can’t get much worse so that’s a good thing.

ADA was not a pump and dump at Coinbase. They were pumped since Jan and super hard too. The day Coinbase Pro allowed them to trade, everyone took profit and it tanked. ADA was $.40 less than two months ago and $1.50ish when it launched on Coinbase Pro. I think the ADA community thought that the Coinbase members would pump it back up the next day and that never happened.

Meaning that even after the next halvening (last one was May 2020, so first half of 2024) BTC will *just* then catch up to Ethereum after it's issuance drop. BTC would drop to 164,250 a year (450 x 365). Adjust supply for 3 years out --- 18,665,000 + (328,500\*3) = 19,650,500 --- and we get to .83% issuance. Roughly and right smack dab in the middle of the Ethereum range.

Meaning then it won't be until 2028 that BTC will be back to having the lower issuance rate.",Bob-Rossi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mdrc4t/the_ethereum_value_proposition_a_beginners_guide/,The Ethereum Value Proposition: A Beginner's Guide

2401,2021-03-26 21:57:53,"ETH is already establishing itself as the money of the Internet. NFTs are tapping hard into the internet art, meme and gaming culture & they're priced in ETH; ETH is the best trustless collateral in DeFi with tens of billions of $ worth locked up.

Around 8% of the supply is locked in DeFi, and 3.1% of the supply locked in the beacon chain for staking (which will only become more as Coinbase and RocketPool are rolling out their staking solutions). I also expect the use of ETH in DeFi to grow substantially as the yield is simply too attractive and DeFi is still exploding in new usecases and projects.

And then you give institutional investors a choice: Do you invest in BTC, or do you invest in an asset that is a hedge against inflation (even more so after EIP-1559) *and* generates a yearly yield on top of it?

And while we're talking, big companies are onboarding to DeFi soon, lead by the baseline protocol https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/; they now also have a lot of choices in terms of which Layer 2 to pick from. If you don't believe me, here you go: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mb80at/daily_general_discussion_march_23_2021/gs6268t/ 

This is from Paul Brody, head of EY blockchain. They are revolutionizing ERP systems by breaking up all the siloed data in ERPs and enabling fortune 500 companies to trust each other by leveraging a credibly neutral middleware, and that's Ethereum.

And you're wondering if you should buy ETH? With rollups going live in a couple weeks/months, EIP-1559 in July that will make ETH deflationary, and a rapid move to Proof of Stake by the end of the year.

I’m just trying to logically follow through what you are saying.  We better all hope that the dapps are so great that people will continue to pay us with scarcity by burning their super high value ETH. That’s a complicated tug-of-war right there.  I don’t know where it will balance out, but if the network of dapps that backs ETH are too expensive, is that really a benefit in the long term?

Question about deflation. In your example there’s 100 million Eth and 1 million is burned per years. First is that $1m each year or .99 the second year .981 the third, etc. 

Assuming the latter, are Eth developers really looking at building a logarithmically decreasing money supply? That seems so extreme. I was imagining you would see some tiny reduction in the total that didn’t increase, but also didn’t really diminish the total pot. This way I’m 50 years were at maybe 70 million Eth.

I don’t understand why everyone is so happy for the supply to deflate when it runs counter to the purpose of Ethereum to act as the world’s computer. No one wants to build computation engines based on an asset that will become more expensive to use for its users.

2750,2021-03-31 16:18:11,"Thanks for your post - a good read. I agree with most of your points - point 5 - invest in the company, not the market... i agree and disagree with this.  There is good short term money to be made through investing in value in the market although many beginners can lose out with the wrong entry. All of my long term holdings (about 75% of portfolio) are in companies that i believe in... the remaining 25% is in market opportunities that may be for a few days, weeks or months.

Personally i'm a little (not much) more bullish on price but as you say we're all just guessing really and a number of things need to fall into place to see a significant rise (more licences, good quality and exclusive licensing, increased veve customers, increase number of drops, catering for more global customer base through enabling access and accessible drop times etc).  I personally don't think of it as a crypto - its a very different type of product and project to ETH, ADA BNB etc. If it gets mainstream adoption from people who don't understand crypto then the collectibles business is one of the most lucrative given the emotional pull from collectors to collect.",gibbondog,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecomi/comments/mgwwvq/for_new_investors_some_thoughts_on_price/,"For new investors: Some thoughts on price predictions, selling, and asking for advice"

Very literally quantum computing is becoming a thing, and fast. Shor's algorithm will literally decimate btc and any other crypto relying on factoring being hard, unless there is some massive update and even then this would still leave all lost wallets vulnerable / wallets people forgot their passwords to. And let's be honest bitcoin updates are always dreams that never occur.

Is there an argument against this, I don't really see people here talk about it, and obviously butts would never even let this slip there minds?

Edit: note that this applies to much of our modern infrastructure and cyber security and it kind of is terrifying people aren't addressing this and trying to update to quantum resistant protocols.

4843,2021-04-05 06:07:40,"Bitcoin has appreciated one million percent in the last decade. I personally would be cautious trying to short something with that much momentum. Bitcoin could easily do 4x from here before a major correction. Going short seems like poor risk reward. Where would your stop loss be?  With a traditional short your losses are theoretically unlimited. Buying a put sounds sort of appealing since it's a finite loss - MSTR premiums are kinda crazy though. 

Early last year the stock to flow model predicted $20k bitcoin by the end of 2020. All the bears scoffed, but of course we actually blew past that number. That model predicts $150k to $300k by the end of 2021. Interest continues to grow, new ETFs are being formed, big banks are getting into it and bitcoin continues to move off exchanges into cold storage. We are in the middle of the bull cycle following the last halving. The RSI hasn't yet reached the massively overbought levels we've seen in previous cycles. All near term indicators seem to be bullish. 

If I were determined to short bitcoin I would target Q4 2021. The cycle is expected to peak around that time. Who knows of course. We will at some point get a big pullback - even the bulls expect this to happen. Find other indicators like RSI, maybe you can find multiple signals in the Sept or Oct timeframe pointing to a cycle peak. You could also target a psychological level like $100k.

There's an indicator called pi-cycle that lines up with the last two bitcoin peaks. It's just the crossover of a 111 day moving average and 2x a 350day moving average. And again Q4 is when that's expected to happen.",disarrange_daily,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,Does it make sense to dollar cost average short positions on Bitcoin?
4840,2021-04-05 06:13:03,"Beyond DCA not being a real financial strategy, there's a problem with this whole concept -- you're relying on DAI to hold up in the event of a BTC crash.  This seems ... unlikely at best.  The way the ecosystem is currently set up, while it may be a Tether crisis that takes down Bitcoin, a Bitcoin crisis will *definitely* take down Tether, and Tether will take every unbanked exchange with it.  The DAI peg is maintained by ""collateral"" that's just ETH-based crypto, all of which is nearly certain to collapse when BTC does.  It's no good being able to easily pay off your worthless BTC shorts if your winnings are in equally-worthless DAI.

Any method of shorting BTC, directly or indirectly, needs to either:

a) be on some entity completely outside the crypto ecosystem, like options on MSTR at a real stockbroker, or

b) leave you with actual USD at a real bank on the long side, and crypto assets on the short side, so that if the crypto ecosystem vanishes *completely* you still have your profits.

Otherwise, you're asking to get left holding the bag when the curtain falls.

(b is obviously very hard to achieve -- since the unregulated nature of crypto means the exchanges can't enforce anything, so if a customer is *ever* long dollars-off-the-exchange and short crypto the odds of them simply vanishing are high.)",DjangoWexler,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,Does it make sense to dollar cost average short positions on Bitcoin?

4348,2021-04-10 06:00:27,"Do what you personally want with your money/shares. 

Here’s my view, 

GameStop transition, who knows what it can become. I’ve taken moonshots before only to sell at the absolute worse times. 

Take Gevo for example. I believed (still do) in that company since I started investing in 2015. They have had so many haters, trash talkers, shorts, bad publicity, lawsuits on patents (of which they won), splits, share price going from ~$0.30 to $24, and back constantly. I had gotten fleeced so many times because of stupid shit I’ve read by people who don’t know anymore than you or I. 

Fast forward to me picking investing back up two years ago, I accrued 2707 shares of Gevo @$0.80 average....

Months and months of trash talking and bleeding from short interest. “Hey I heard such and such are invested in this, they’re known to bleed companies.” I ignored it as long as I could but I just got to a point where enough was enough. I believed so much in their direction, but I sold. And then it happens. At this point I’m too invested elsewhere with no available funds. And I Watch over days as it glides to $15 a share. And now even through the worst times it fluctuates maybe between $7 and $10 a share. 

The point is, if through YOUR research and due fucking diligence you believe in YOUR investment, not randos on discord. You already know what to do brother. 

Hopefully you realize by now wallstreetsbets has always shared home to real time investors and they are more apart of the reddit crow than people think. Always have been. 

Next time you question anything, just ask yourself, am I personally making the best decision? Have I invested what I’m okay with losing? And then shake the fuck out of that magic 8 ball until ALL SIGNS POINT TO YES. Lol 

It’s not just about gme. This is a hedge against the inevitable. Will it work out? Who knows. 

But isn’t it fun to play the game? 

They get mad when you dont invest like you should. They get mad when you don’t sell.

2700,2021-04-10 12:08:16,"Personal story. 

A long time like 3-4 years ago which is a long time ago in Crypto years. 

I mainly bought bitcoin, litecoin, and Ethr cause they were the only ones available on coinbase. 

I always wanted to buy Dogecoins since I first heard of them. So I created an account on kraken and bought Dogecoins and then I proceeded to buy some other altcoins that may actually have value. Well I bought these coins at the height of Crypto Hysteria in Jan and Feb 2018. 

I have a shit to of alt coins. Also have a couple of bitcoins.i then pretty much emptied everything sometime around 2017 or 2018 first during the 19k btc peak then in late 2018 just Everything dipped to low thousands. Still made a few thousands. 

Sometime in 2019 I bought a good bit of bitcoin and I still had a ton of ltc and Ethr laying around. Decided to not fuck with it. And then popped off this year. And then I started investing in crypto again recently after bitcoin passed 15k mark. Things have gone up more in BTC, ETHR, and LTC than altcoins. More so BTC and ETHR. But LTC is doing just trucking along 

They are backbones. I mainly invest in those three. And then what happens with alt coins is just what happens. If it peaks and goes off crazy and I make a huge profit then awesome. 

If it goes back to the pennies then it is what it is. I'm content with it. 

Goal is to eventually pay off home mortgage. Once I get that amount to pay it off I'll probably empty it pay the taxes and pay off the home loan. 

Honestly the Peace I felt when my parents home loan was finished was great. I want that. It takes off a lot of stress. Property tax and HOA is a huge reduction than monthly mortgage.",downtimeredditor,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mnozjj/no_matter_how_new_you_are_to_crypto_you_are_in_a/,"No matter how new you are to crypto, you are in a unique position!"

***Some of the points, though technically correct, are misleading.***  Examples: **1)**""*Citadel owes the interest to the Broker, not the lender.*"" While technically correct, this is misleading, because (unless you're getting screwed by RobinHood) the broker takes this interest and passes it along to the lender in the form of a ""rebate"" aka money- meaning, lenders get paid.

***Some of the points, though technically correct, are misleading.***  Examples: **1)**""*Citadel owes the interest to the Broker, not the lender.*"" While technically correct, this is misleading, because (unless you're getting screwed by RobinHood) the broker takes this interest and passes it along to the lender in the form of a ""rebate"" aka money- meaning, lenders get paid.

Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested. Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold. Remember compound interest. There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.

I would like more information on this part. In the research I've done wrapped BTC or ETH has very low yields (1-2%) so I must be missing opportunities here. What are these opportunities for high returns that you speak of?

619,2021-04-11 09:43:56,"YES! Hammer home how important BTC is to evaluate the performance of your coin!People here often are oblivious to it and never check their alts against BTC.If they did they would see that even really succesful alts don't outperform BTC outside of a massive bull run and usually lose value against it long term.Yes even ETH.

>If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately. Why? Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you. You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.

This is also really important. I always delete my old coins and never look back. It's just insane to torment yourself with eventual ""losses"" or money you miss out on.

I only have about 20 bucks in each coin, but since I invested literally zero fiat, I feel like it's not bad at all.   Brave only paid me about 20 bucks value in Crypto for the last 8 months, but I've managed to make 5x time that with just good trades and decent times.    I'm happy.

You do make a lot of interesting point though I think a lot of your thought process revolves around Bitcoin. 

To me, a somewhat of an atheist, this is like saying though you have your other paths you must still believe and trust in god or something.

I like everything you have to say about tracking crypto/gains/losses and paying attention to taxes. This is very important information. health savings accounts and retirement plans are also sick ways to avoid taxes, and heal/support yourself lol

I don’t think spending 3-4 hours a day reading about crypto is sound advices. Maybe at the early stages if you don’t understand fundamentals or terminology but this is bonkers.

I think being active in subreddits of your coins.x participating somewhat in daily discussions, asking questions about things you don’t understand, and doin your own research are all great over looking tips. 

If you love a coin and believe in its future and utility, why not dedicate some income. If you think it’s truly undervalued and it’s price will go up why not put it aside as an investment. 

If everyone who is new in crypto is in it to make money, why are we here in the first place? 

New technology’s and real world use cases are evolving everyday. I think NFTs are a great example of this as you’ve said. 

I like a lot of the apps and services you’ve mentioned. Although if people don’t know something like that, I think maybe some lingo and vocabulary may be challenging although I dont know, like most things I’m 80% sure, give or take. 

Overall this is amazing and I think you for this post.

I left it all for better days.

First mistake, left it on an exchange, now it didn't get hacked BUT it got delisted and due to Kucoin being in my opinion a shitty exchange I have lost about 20.000 USD on the delisted coin. Now I have written them that I know how crypto work so de listing dosent make my coins magically wanish, they are in a free wallet or kucoin sold em off.

So make sure you are up to date on de listing and if you don't plan on selling keep it in a wallet.

607,2021-04-11 14:10:04,"What a really long winded explanation of how to complicate cryptocurrency trading, spread your money as far and wide as possible, create an absolute tax nightmare and click your way to bankruptcy.

Most people here are trading in the 1000-5000 range, if that. All this advice is *possibly* only slightly helpful if trading is your job and your pushing towards 10k, researching 2-3 hours A DAY!? bore off, I'm working 10 hours a day, who the fuck has time for that.

I've been investing in crypto since only February 12th, gained 20% so far, compared to any other investment on this earth, that's unbeatable. Yeah bore me with the bull market talk, 20% is still 20%, I've seen plenty of posts about people losing in recent months, and the only way they do this is by overcomplicating things, and buying shit coins.

For what it's worth, and that's probably very little, but here is my advice, what I've learned, and my journey. 
Joined coinbase > did coinbase earn (£30) > traded earned coins for BTC > traded that £30 between different coins, exchanges and wallets until I lost almost all of it, mostly due to fees, this is called 'LEARNING' and is the best £30 I ever wasted, especially as it was free > bought BTC & ETH on coinbase > bought ADA & NANO on binance, xferred to exodus and staked the ADA > been adding to these 4 coins since, splitting it like 60/20/10/10 respectively ^ > profit.

I've set up stop limit orders to protect my initial investment plus 10%, if and when I reach 30% profit I will move that to 20%, and so on. I don't DCA, I just buy dips, invest how you like. The only mistake I feel I've really made, is actually not investing enough earlier, but if you're not comfortable, don't do it, that's how it goes wrong. But for those of you in a position where you're a bit afraid to invest larger amounts, whack it in and set up a stop limit order, this technically can't fail and all you'll lose is fee's.

Most money in crypto is earned from the value increasing, so all you have to do is simply own that coin, that's it.",Nixher,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/moilxv/im_been_in_crypto_since_2013_maybe_700_alt_coins/,I'm been in crypto since 2013.

assuming that BTC (and some ETH) is the main holding, what % is located to the other 8-9 coins?
for example is having 1000 ADA really worth it? or 500 coins/tokens on the EFT flavour of the month?

i do own ADA (not that exact amount, was just picking a number) but obviously you won't retire on 1000 ADA unless you really want to hold it long long term

is it better to keep pumping that number up to say over 10,000 ADA or is the funds best used to buy more BTC instead?",chiefdeville,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/moilxv/im_been_in_crypto_since_2013_maybe_700_alt_coins/,I'm been in crypto since 2013.

Many newcomers who jump right into trading because they don't have patience and want to make money quick will get rekt. If not instantly, then when the bullmarket ends. Just like 2018. So learning some hard lessons from the previous generation is a good idea.

As for me, I decided that trading is not for me and I am better off holding and selling along the larger market cycles.

1017,2021-04-13 15:53:41,"""they've invested in BTC for the profit"" - most are BTC at treasury reserves. So, ""they've invested in USD for the profit"" would be analogous. Microstrategy intends to use some as currency (paying non employee board members with BTC).  Tesla intends to accept BTC for vehicles/services, without immediate exchange to fiat.

It will only make sense for institutions to sell this early if they need the capital.  It's a treasury asset for them. Held for reserves.  Selling, just because ""profit"" would lead to a significant tax burden.  I'm more worried about them selling for a deep loss for the tax-loss harvest. 

Companies like that don't burn their reserves unless they have a good reason.  They don't have to sell BTC for fiat to make profit.

They x10 their btc, but because they have tons they need to pump the hell of the alts to then dump slowly for months, they now have maybe x2-x3 their btc but it's way enough because they have hundreds of millions. 

People need to realize alt coins are called shitcoin for a reason, they produce no value nor any utility, people are in euphoria right now because it's free money for everyone but wait until whales starts to dump their alts into btc, the only true crypto to hold in bearmarket is btc. 

I agree we might not see a -85% drop in btc because of institutional buying pressure, but your alts that nobody wants except dumb retails?

However, I start believing that the only catalysts for institutions to dump BTC is a return of confidence in USD and a return of “normal life” post pandemic. What made institutions adopt BTC this cycle around is not because they received a revelation out of nowhere and changed their mind.  
The stars perfectly aligned this cycle for the adoption of BTC: pandemic, money printing, loss of confidence in fiat, economy and regulators, distrust in the conventional system, realisation that things can change brutally and very fast, realisation that we must adapt to a new era, etc. Because of all of these catalysts, BTC is seen as a solution and it will remain a solution as long as the problems persist.

4133,2021-04-13 21:06:11,"It's all very simple.

Crypto is a largely unregulated market.

We know throughout all of human history, if you leave private interests to set their own ethical standards, they'll do what's in their interests above and beyond the short, medium or long term interests of their community (see: The Tragedy of the Commons).

So it makes sense that unregulated crypto markets are going to be fraught with questionable business and ethical practices.   A ""stablecoin"" that doesn't have proper audits, cannot and should not be trusted to be appropriately asset-backed.   An exchange that does not have adequate regulatory oversight should not be trusted to not be wash trading or front running.  

The ultimate irony is that crypto is supposed to be a ""trustless"" system, but most of its players are trusting they're not being taken advantage of.    Why is this?   Perhaps it is because they all are too busy taking advantage of others to wonder how much they're being taken advantage of?",AmericanScream,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mppwq4/rewritten_a_decentralized_conspiracy/,Rewritten.

Why do you think this? Big money jumps ship all the time and then buys back in on the dips. Plus with the little regulations surrounding crypto it could be much worse.

If I was big money I would wait for the momentum to die down a bit, then get with my big money buddies to all dump the fuck out of bitcoin at the same time while opening up shorts. Then when that momentum dies open up longs and start buying the fuck out of it again.

Yes, because you don't have the same amount of bitcoin that will get you to 90k at a price of 300k.

What people used to do was a 60/40 split stocks/bonds

Not financial advice, but I personally would not think its insane or anything to be 95/5 stockindexfunds/bitcoin

The ""safe"" end is the stock index fund (nothing is safe in this world, know that)

But the ""risky"" end is the bitcoin end which is giving amazing returns relative to the risk I think you're actually taking, but JUST my opinion

I am not giving you financial advice okay

I personally think that if you/'re 80/20 stockindex and bitcoin, you will be totally fine, don't reindex during a bull run maybe?

DYOR (do your OWN research)

Etc!

Have you got all the basics of /r/personalfinance squared away?? Be sure you do, have an EMERGENCY FUND

Do not ever put money into bitcoin that you need for your life!

Good book on this (not about bitcoin) but about making money is ""The Psychology of Money"", find it at your favorite bookseller

Do whatever makes you sleep at night and not worry! Let your emotions guide this, imagine how sad you'd be if bitcoin crashed and you didn't diversify, and alternately how happy you'd be if you stayed in and bitcoin soared, but you did diversify. Find a happy medium so you stop worrying. That's your risk tolerance. DONT hang it all on a dream in case it doesn't come true. But DO give yourself a chance at something great.

Have an emergency fund, 3 months, 6 months. Cash is trash, but savings do still matter. They let you overcome unforeseen problems.

Live modestly, you'll be okay, don't brag about your bitcoin, keep it on the down low :)

In 2018 I just bought with lump sums, and the coins would fall shortly after. It's easy to feel like a genius in a bull market and just throw all your cash in, but if you DCA you take all the emotion out of the game, and ride both the ups and downs. It will also keep you investing during a bear market, which can ensure great gains in the future :)",arealhorrorshow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msmszm/some_advice_straight_up_from_the_2018_bull_run/,Some advice straight up from the 2018 bull run

They are now structured into tiers where the top tiers get a signal earlier than the bottom tiers and usually by the time the bottom tiers get the signal its too late, so unless you pay money to part of the top tier or have a connection with the admins its not even profitable.

I'm getting runescape merchant clan vibes from this haha.

They used to pump the prices of some items and then the higher rank clan members would dump their stake before everyone else.

So what I used to do was get into the pump and then sell it for a small profit instead of a potentially big one.

1357,2021-04-17 18:52:53,"Thanks for the post. Some great insights!

I would reconsider this section though:

I like to think of the portfolio in terms of these segments:

Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

Privacy coins - Monero, Zcash, DASH..etc

Finance/Bank settlement coins - Ripple, Stellar...etc

Enterprise Blockchain solutions - Polkadot, Chainlink...etc

Promising/Innovative Tech coins - EOS, IOTA, Cardano...etc

Speculative/Moon shots - VERGE, YLD...etc

1. Your categories are wildly inaccurate based on blockchain ecosystem, and comparables

2. While its great to have some mental model for risk management and diversification, it means nothing. There are really no established markets outside of:

- Protocols
- DeFi/Exchange Tokens
- NFTs
- Utility Tokens
- Speculative Coins (90% of thibgs out there)

Diversifications is about exposing yourself to multiple MARKETS, to reduce risk in a certain one. There is no established market for privacy coins, and no discernible consistent utility, so all of these need to fall into the speculative category. There’s no model you can create to represent market dynamics.

Protocols are governed by tps, coins in circulation, with some supply dynamics.

DeFi is governed by TVL, exchange volume, and supply dynamics

NFTs by number of resales, comparable merch, and appreciation over time. Right now, you just want to accumulate some time based NFTs and hold em for 10 years if you are into this kind of thing. Im staying away. Might buy a cryptokitty or topshot for lulz. But NFTs are only valuable if you can generate resale.

Utility Tokens - similar to protocols, but also can be modelled by fees or fiat consumption, but TAM is restricted to the specific real world market comparable for that good/service

And then everything else. Buy it and hope it pumps during the bull run. 

Most everything moves together so tbh diversification is only useful in case of a rug or big fud/catalyst that you want to use to daytrade.

With that said, buying BTC/ETH and just sitting on it will beat 90% of people trying to ‘diversify’ in the long run.",Environmental-Kiwi78,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msmszm/some_advice_straight_up_from_the_2018_bull_run/,Some advice straight up from the 2018 bull run

1393,2021-04-18 00:28:52,"I don't agree with most of this, I also went through 2017 and here is my take:

1- Each person is different and there is no general number you can throw randomly like this. For some 5%-10%, for others  it might be 30%. It all depends on your goals and risks tolerance. A money adviser would help you with this.

2- I agree

3- Holding gives better return only in a bull market, many made the mistakes of holding in 2018-19 bear market and lost 90% 

4- Long term investment in crypto is risky and looking back at 2017 fundamentals, nothing is valid to this day. New coins came along, new technology ... Yes researching might protect you from scams, but we are still far from mass adoption for Altcoins and thinking you found a solid project is naïve. 

5- FOMO happens when trading, not when Hodling and you said not to trade and 'hodl' was better, so which?

6- Everybody is a genius in a bull market and most people will lose in the following bear market.

7- I agree, you can't have all the projects that moon, yes you will miss on DOGE and others, but that is ok.

8- This goes with your 'research' at 4-

9- Diversification happens with uncorrelated assets, all of Crypto is correlated and it's delusional to think you build a diversified portfolio, it is not. Too many coins will dilute your potential gains.

10- like 8- this goes with your 'research' at 4-

11- I agree",GameofCHAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msmszm/some_advice_straight_up_from_the_2018_bull_run/,Some advice straight up from the 2018 bull run

> India apparently banning crypto

It won't be permanent but absolutely is grounds for a 10-20% temporary correction before the world moves on because imagine leaving the future of the world's finances in the hands of a dozen schmucks in the Indian government

> China miner FUD

A giant nothingburger

> USA Treasury Secretary wagging its finger at dubious Russian Fintech companies that launder money

This is a good thing. Fuck money launderers and tax evaders.

> whales manipulating prices to hunt stop losses

Happens at least once a month now

> cascading crash on Binance from degenerate leverage traders

Literally nobody cares about leverage traders. I don't think they even deserve a suicide hotline post lol. Leverage trading is like being asked if you want to be shot in the head for a chance at winning a million bucks. Sure, you might live, but you'll have brain damage if you do it.

We think the game is rigged with stocks but crypto takes the cake. The only reason why btc and eth and every other shitcoin is the price they’re at is because a new class of bag holders have come in to take the place of people cashing out.

The exchanges themselves trade against you and rip you off with ridiculous spreads. I got fed up. 

The thing is with crypto is you’re counting on fomo and suckers to come and buy your bags. Yeah we’re in it to make money but AMC is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take back wealth that the 0.01% has stolen through wallstreet shenanigans.

883,2021-04-18 18:19:45,"Here is also another great [explanation](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt5odv/explanation_the_recent_crash_was_probably_due_to/) from [u/Fragsworth](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fragsworth/)

"" *Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.*

*But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.*

*So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.*

*This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

49,2021-04-18 23:29:46,"Bitcoin is heavily manipulated. To prove my point I'll share a few things I've uncovered. From January to now every time it hits a peak (which is usually a 10k gain) within 10 days it drops back down (usually between 20-10%) then around that 10day mark it starts to climb back up. And within 20 days time you'll see it hits a new peak and then starts the downturn again. Look at at the dates Jan 9th to Jan 26th. Feb 28th to Mar 13th. Mar 25th to April 15th. Look at every pean and then every drop. You'll see its like clock work. 20days grown 10days drop. That is clearly programs set to do this. 

Maybe I'm paranoid but either way I don't trust it. 

Personally I was so hype about crypto two years ago. Then when I saw banks and HF stepping in I was like there goes the free market. I'll still add some to my portfolio but not falling for the hype. 

I like AMC so much more. Even w/o a squeeze I'll be doubling my investment. But I know with 100% conviction that the squeeze is eminent. I'm 10k shares in.

917,2021-04-19 00:12:00,"Nah, news is smoke and mirrors. You don't need news to drop.

Few facts:

Week and half ago there was inflows of 10k BTC to binance. This was never distributed/sold. Or at least wasn't sold fully. I suspect this was to prepare dump by selling some BTC to fund shorts without triggering bots with inflows of stables to cex. 

Mex whale posted buy wall at 54k in form of 4-5 X 5m walls and left it there untill fully filed. 51k which was tapped was only 50x liquidations levels. Most likely nobody was filled at this places. Nance is known for that. Stop will not trigger but bids won't get filled neither. Flash crash u might say. 

There was inflow/mint  of 96m busd to binance which most likely propped price to 63k or what ever ath was. 

There was 600m of stable coins inflows to another cex which also can be considered as the funds to prop the price to new ath. 

Now fun part:

There was open interest of 25b and only 10b was liquidated recently on derivatives side.

This means cex which ever started most likely Nance MM knew exactly liquidations levels and propped the price to build longs on retail side.

Then used 10k of BTC deposited early to open shorts and when time was right dump happened cascading stops of this degen apes. 

This was enough to bring price to 51k which conveniently closed of all gaps at CME , filled that whale on mex with 54k bids of 20m or more. 

Outflows of BTC confirm that fact.

But where is profit you ask???

10k of BTC on Nance was used partially to sell and fund shorts. This was easier way to cover all this. When enough shirts was filled bid walls was posted across different cex and when time was right dump started triggering stops. 

1. 10k BTC was sold for average price of xxx- profit most likely. 
2. Shorts - brought back massive gains in form of stables.
3. Stable walls got filled with triggered stops. Outflows showing just that. 
4. Profits from short (no.2 ) used to filled longs opposite directions. (This might be not happened yet, to much retail still in greed mode).
 

I think also Eth and other coins was bought or at least longs was opened. 


Everything can be checked. 
Blackout and stories of China mining is only to cover this great manipulation. 

Shortly after bank.of China is posting about crypto products as investment. How convenient. 

Nance most of this time when shit dumped and cascade stops was not responding to any bids. 
Please check Reddit and Twitter to confirm that. 

If you know how to play this game you will and should be rich.

4406,2021-04-21 08:27:18,"Let's talk practically here. What sets your argument apart from a pump & dump scheme is singularly that there is no ""dump"" phase since the end goal is the conversion of DOGE into essentially a mainstream currency. But what would that look like? Could DOGE actually be a functional currency of the world?

Well first of all, we have to be careful with the market cap here. BTC stands at a bit over $1 trillion as one of many stores of value. But currency is different. Its market cap is, well, literally all the money in the world. The market cap of all existing money is roughly $37 trillion (ignoring all the money that's sitting in investments and whatnot, which takes it up over a quadrillion USD). So we're actually talking about DOGE being $333 USD equivalents (although in your scenario, USD equivalents wouldn't mean anything anyway) at its current supply. That would be approximately 1000x where it is today, so congrats! Just 99.9% of the way left to go.

Now, what exactly makes DOGE a better currency than, let's say, pretty much anything else that's already used? Is it its whopping 30 transactions per second capability? Nope, that's just 2% of what a single major credit card does (1500 TPS). And those things don't do accounting for every single transaction that exists as your global currency would need to.

So is it its inflation, which unlike deflationary currencies, would drive people to spend it? Well again, no. No one is going to go hungry for a year because they might see their dollar go up 5% in value. People just don't think that way (for good reason, obviously). Inflation is an important feature of modern fiat currencies, but DOGE doesn't even get that right. It has fixed inflation, which functionally doesn't replace deflation or scarcity in the long run - just does it in a roundabout way.

So then maybe it's a good store of value, like Bitcoin. You wouldn't use it for your day to day transactions, but something to keep on the balance sheets as it appreciates and holds value over time. But then why? Really, why? DOGE is just a copy of Bitcoin with a doge mascot, far less actual investment interest, and far less development effort. Stores of value get that title because people are confident that they are valuable - and a currency that's made a name for itself as bending to the whims of whatever Elon Musk tweets does not inspire such confidence.

And who really are you proving a point to by doing all of this? Overturning the global financial system? Pretty sure that's what Bitcoin claimed to be doing. You argue that Doge can somehow circumvent an established elite taking over it without clarifying why or addressing the fact that DOGE is already highly centralized as is. Not to mention that your grand utopia even as described doesn't eliminate a grand elite class - it apparently just changes who those people are.

So no, with DOGE there will be an endpoint that cashes out to fiat. And if that's the case, like we established in the beginning of this post, there's no difference between your description of ""coordinated capital"" and a good ol' fashioned pump and dump.",omgwherearetheponies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv5zdi/doge_doesnt_have_to_be_a_pump_and_dump/,Doge doesn't have to be a pump and dump.

1012,2021-04-21 16:07:43,"About your initial thesis: how exactly would hf make money on their short positions? Or even resetting ftd? 

From my perspective, gains on shorts are realized, when you buy back shares cheaper than what you sold them for (near impossible now) _and_ exit your position by delivering the bought shares to the lenders. Until exiting the position, all potential gains are unrealized and still at risk. 

As for resetting ftd: you'd have to find/ create new shares available to borrow. So you continuously exit and reenter short positions.

2799,2021-04-21 18:21:49,"13 days ago I bought 25 billion elongates
When I saw the first dip I panic sold and at the end bought again. The result? With the same money I was able to buy back 17 BLN only. I must have burned like 5000 EUR of profit on that transaction alone

Then again the price fell and my initial 3k investment from being worth 7000 went down all the way down to 2000, I freaked out for two straight days, BUT I HOLDED.
Result? 4 days later that same coins were worth 14500.
I took out 4000 (initial 3k invested +1000 profit) and I had another 9000 left in the wallet.

Morale? Just hold and if you can, buy more 
As soon as I saw the dip this time I put another 2000 dollars in.
Even if price goes down a little it will rise back much higher.

3661,2021-04-21 19:04:11,"You should be more open-minded. I have a hard time taking people seriously who call Dogecoin garbage. Merge mined with LTC, so very secure. Fair launch (no premine or ICO). Powerful branding. Legacy coin - been around for a long time. Let’s address the criticism. Read what the Monero people write about trailing emissions with no hard cap. Now I like Litecoin even more in this regard because it gets to benefit from Doge’s inflation while having a hard cap itself. Founder called it a joke, but I mean it’s decentralized so who cares. It speaks to Doge’s maturity that the founder is irrelevant. Lack of development - okay well what do you want? It’s a simple payment system and it works fine. Upgrades that have been applied to Bitcoin and Litecoin would be pretty easy to implement if Doge needs to scale. Concentration of wealth, yes it definitely has a problem there, and that’s personally why I don’t have any, but I wouldn’t call it garbage on that one count. And that will go away with time too.

However, they take on counterparty risk and offload that to you. And even if they do due dilligence as well as large banks, they could well be lending to the next crypto equivalent of Archegos. And if or when that blows up, its not the winklevii who will lose, its you.

And this isnt exactly a stretch, the only ones interested in borrowing crypto are the ones who want to trade on leverage and the available leverage  + volatility of crypto makes the stock market plays that archegos did look decidedly safe.

There is a reason the winklevii are not lending their own stash, but paying you peanuts so that you put your bitcoin at risk. They know who they lend to, and on what terms; you dont. If they thought the risk was zero, or even worth the fees they charge, they would be lending their own coin. They do not need yours because they lack liquidity, they sit on 100K or something bitcoin. They need you to shoulder the risk that they deem not worth the fees.

2947,2021-04-24 16:20:18,"This is very interesting. 

I think one of the things that escapes the proponents of Bitcoin is that POW might not allow Bitcoin to ever penetrate into the mainstream. What the Bitcoin proponents argue is that POW's power consumption should be seen as a good thing - I call this the ""bitcoin as a battery narrative"". This might be true. What is often missed is that it does not matter if it's true or not, if the general perception of Bitcoin is that it's a massively wasteful system - a narrative that is already penetrated the story told about Bitcoin - whether one likes it or not. 

This is often missed. 

One can image a not-so-distant future where a company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet might be seen as a company which contributes to global warming, green house emotions, is selfish by doing so, and so on. 

Whether this thesis is correct or not on a factual basis does not matter if it is being held by a group of people powerful enough (what Nassim Taleb calls the dictatorship of a loud minority) to bring the heat to the public by holding this narrative. And public companies hate controversies. They care not if Bitcoin is a good investment if the brand might caught cross-fire from a loud minority which might tarnish their brand. 

I can already see a group of these loud minorities holding up signs outside of Sturbux saying ""this company is polluting the earth. Ban Bitcoin now"". 

Even if these annoying group of people are wrong, they might be loud enough to create the narrative. We can see for example the reputation done to nuclear power plants as an example - humanities best energy resource was abandoned because of public perception of it - not by what it actually was. This is a critical point to understand. 

I think humanity has reached a point it its perception of technology that tech should bring a bettering of society. And I think that hundreds of articles written about Bitcoin's ability to become a store of energy might not be enough to change the public view of it - especially in the face of POS alternatives - as a technological progress.",asl2dwncb29dakjn3daj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mglu8u/how_ethereum_can_become_a_multitrillion_dollar/,How Ethereum can become a multi-trillion dollar asset: A summary of Bankless Episode #57 Ultra Sound Money

Endorsing something that is well known to cause more people to lose than to gain, is simply in poor taste. Shitcoins ARE a gamble, and a terrible one at that. BSC IS the casino of crypto, arguably no better than a gas station game bar where people go to lose their paychecks after work.

I got really lucky and put 80 dollars on moonpirate within a few hours of its launch and I hit big with it. Taking some profits from that I put them back into shitcoins (got in early on bonfire too). my shitcoin portfolio is somewhere in the region of 10-14k. Iv now got 3k in busd waiting to be invested in legit coins when the market picks up again. These are a gamble and they are hugely risky, iv gotten bad coins and rugged but to be honest iv actually won on more coins than lost, maybe I just got lucky, but I'm only putting in small amounts and I'm only using money I made from my original 80 dollars, so it seems like a good move for the time being.

Suddenly here in America I saw there was nowhere real easy to find wallet-crypto-trade-userfriendly-easy I could find on the interwebnets. Maybe Kraken????? Wtf is Kraken tho. I literally know nothing. One gd site that I maybe could find DOGE on?!

Then of course suddenly DOGE went to $.40. Like that moment basically. The mark where the rocket went straight up in the DOGE chart? That's where I cashed out small profit from RH.

So guess who bought back in on RH (fraction of old 20k) to at least deal in DOGE at around $.30? I'm fomo sorry seriously. Where tf do we go to do DOGE, BTC, ETH, LTC, etc etc etc etc right? All I have for crypto is Coinbase and RH (I get they're not ""my coins"" in RH tho)
