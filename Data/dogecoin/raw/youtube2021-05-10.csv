However Now if the price of the dogecoin goes up to $1 or $10, it won’t be because of Elon and it won’t crash.

170,"Dude,I love your videos and your knowledge in crypto but I’m quite astonished and shocked that despite being educated, you are also still in dilemma to get the vaccine or not which is absurd. Haven’t you taken vaccinations for Cholera, Typhoid, Polio etc in your childhood? COVID vaccination is nothing different to those and being an educated and influential person on YouTube, you should take a lead and educate people to get vaccination immediately and save India as getting the vaccine is the only way to get away from COVID. If YOU are only in such a dilemma and scared of it, can you imagine about the villagers and illiterate folks? I strongly advise you go get it done right away and also help India get away from it using your channel and that can be a great help as you can save thousands of lives by not getting affected with it and this indeed is great help than providing postmortem help ie, providing some support for the people who already got it and suffering in hospitals. Sorry, if I’m being bit strong but I didn’t expect this from you and you are watching the current situation and still you are not taking it to protect yourself while millions are struggling and desperately waiting to get the vaccine. Btw, my 2 doses are done few weeks ago and no issues whatsoever."

Since you are always so sincere in helping others I also want to give you a sincere suggestion which is really from the heart. If you are having doubts on having your vaccine shot, it is a good sign because you have a mind of your own. Just because everybody is doing it, does not mean it is the right thing to do. For more information if you want to get deeper and you should go deeper, because the vaccine is not a joke, it is a genetic therapy and all of those who are getting these shots are taking part in the biggest experiment orchestrated by the elite. Please please inform yourself before you or loved ones decide to get the shot. Here are some names and terms you should search for:
Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdury
Dr. Vandana Shiva
Dr. Rashid Buttar
Event 201
Agenda 2030
ID2020
Great Reset
You and everybody who has not taken the shot yet has the duty to see the bigger picture before letting something inside their body which is irreversible.
Bless you brother. Greetings from Germany"

637,Bro i seriously advice u to skip this vaccine . There are many reasons to it . Firstly people below the age grp of 50 are fighting with this virus easily with their innate immune system . It's very mild for them and i think u r a healthy young guy and its survival rate is too high for us . Second about these vaccine is that these vaccines are very rushed as they come in a year with no complete raw safety and efficacy data and without studying long term side effects too . These vaccines are still in Emergency authorization means u r a guinea pigs for this experimental vaccines and on also on the ground level i am witnessing people getting vaccinations are facing serious complications of it and even many are dying from it and govt and vaccines manufacturers are not liable for it . so they are easily discarding these side effects.  So no liability means no trust . so plz stay safe not from this virus as this has a survival rate of more than 99% but from the vaccines who are in experimental mode . ... And btw u r a funny and informative guy ma. Luv ur videos🧡🧡

837,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI. His daily trade s!gnals has really helped me grow my !nvestment in the crypt0 m@rket and with the right mentorship and str@tegy, crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for newbies and lnvestor. Burwell is also an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist and you can find his courses on tradlng on the internet for free and they come in handy as an !nvestor and he can be reached on gmαil (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom) and Եҽlҽցɾαต   (@burwellcoleman) for his assistance on crypt0 related enquires."

That's why China issued the ""cryptocurrency"" which it calls ""digital Yuan"".

The fundamentals of this joke coin are a joke - there's an infinite supply! Recent price action is a meme turned into market manipulation pump and dump.

Btc wil top out and we have seen atleast 3 to 4 weeks of mega altcoin runs after btc hits 20k ATH in 2017. I see this happening again but even more aggresivly then 2017 because more people are now possitivly focust on crypto because of musk and dogecoin , people wil search for the next dogecoin when dogecoin is peaked out"

1213,"In recent time, observation has shown an increased in amassing a fortune from investing in cryptocurrency, Even though many people go into it without having a properly laid out strategy which is very paramount irrespective of your hodling or trading route. One of the best ways to avoid losses is trying out different strategies then sticking to the one that works, for as long as it works and  i came to this conclusion when I stumbled on FINN DONOVAN having bought just 2BTC at $8,900 and held a little, I quickly realized that wasn't the way and I started trading using his signals and letting him guide me every step and I've grown my portfolio to more than 10BTC. His signals are extremely accurate and I intend sticking to his aid for as long as possible. For anyone out there who would also want to earn from their bitcoin investment, I advice you get In touch with him Via Telegram:( @Finn_Donovan ) He's the best you 'll ever find out there."

just look at the icon and say the words dog E coin.

and don't you feel stupid for not seeing that?

Dogue? Dodge? really?

who was it that first got that wrong?

and why are the rest of you following their bad example?

what is the reason for not saying it correctly?

is that too cute?

are you afraid it will be too catchy?

-----

-----

Sorry for the length of the following lesson; IT IS AS SHORT AS WAS POSSIBLE.

-----

ALL UNSECURED DIGITAL CURRENCY WILL GO TO ZERO WHEN GOLD BACK DIGITAL CURRENCY IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

When the government offers gold bullion holders FREE storage inside of government warehouses; If the gold bullion holders will allow their gold bullion to be used to back the release of the number of pieces of digital currency which equals their gold bullion.

Imagine names such as KNOX COIN, and PENTAGON COIN, all those different U.S. Government Mints, and well, where ever they store it; THAT IS THE NAME OF THE COIN.

NAH! THERE IS JUST GOING TO BE ONE NAME.

I VOTE FOR KNOX COIN.

WELL, ANYWAY: THAT IS THE DAY

WHEN ALL OTHER DIGITAL CURRENCY

WILL GO TO A VALUE OF ZERO!

I MYSELF WILL NOT BE ONE OF THOSE WHO GET CAUGHT OUT!

I JUST TOLD YOU THE REAL FUTURE OF CRYPTO.

EVERYTHING UP TO AND UNTIL THEN IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS BULL SHYTE!

-----

-----

The government will offer FREE storage of gold bullion, in exchange for using that gold bullion to back the release of an equal amount of 100 percent gold-backed digital currency.

And it will run right alongside our U.S. Dollar, -

FAVORED BY SOME PEOPLE, -

HATED BY OTHERS DUE TO TOTAL TRACKING.

And the government will argue over the dangers that a second gold-backed currency will pose to the U.S. Dollar.

And it won't.

They are wrong to think that it will.

That gold already exists.

But it exists in a useless state of existence;

Just storing and guarding it is costing the owner money;

And this will give it a purpose for existing.

And when the owner wants it back, they will buy back that digital currency which that gold did cover.

-----

-----

It will not be like the silver certificate of the past.

No one holding the digital currency will ever be able to cash those in for gold or silver of platinum or copper or nickel or any of the other real and true assets that are chosen to be allowed to back the 100 percent backed digital currency.

-----

-----

And, NO that gold that lives inside of the market for collectible coins, will not be welcome; 

Those poor fools who have paid above melt value are just stuck with their collectible coins.

The U.S. Government Warehouse into which you put your gold will measure it by ounces in and ounces out;

None of the this is your pallet and that is his pallet games.

So if you were to put your fancy coins in; You are not getting those same fancy coins out."
1222,"it is clearly written to be pronounced:     dog E coin

1261,"I got some confidence in BTC by watching an interview with Lyra.  Her model is not based on the few examples of 4 year cycles, but rather on the rate at which new wallet addresses appear on the blockchain and the nature (size and the behavior of wallets of similar size) of the wallets.  So she models the adoption curve.  He reckons adoption is still in full swing, and her ""moving target"" is currently a price of $300K at end of 2021.  She also mentioned that the $1 trillion market cap is a barrier - that there would be a lot of resistance to falling below $55K.  So I was convinced to start buying BTC again (not much to hodl but trad) If only my friends listened when i first told them about Lyra. My actual portfolio was multiplied by 5 In two months.

The logic says that sooner or later the markets will have to correct to the levels of reality.  But then again, they might not.  I really don't know.  All I know is one thing: my HODL site will remain the same for the next 1,2,3,4,5 years, I have a diversified portfolio that I trade in under the guidance of Hassa.  I have so far managed to double my earnings through dedication and patience in trading by directing them.  A lot of the videos here on YouTube do not take us into a deep understanding of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which is why I have always been an advocate of having a trading or investment coach who can always guide us in the right direction of trading and goodness.about having a trading coach is that a huge number of them do not charge you but would rather provide superb Strategies for you to achieve success.  I have made over 11 Bitcoin profits since November not just by buying the dip but implementing trading strategies from the knowledge I acquired from Camila and her assistance.  You can be able to reach her on t3L3.gramm (@investorHassa) for her assistance, strictly on a clear understanding about trading and investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."

1383,"i hope some of you learn to figure out that pumping an altcoin as hard as elon wants it will tremendously rise the general market cap. And since Doge is literally a joke all that will do is hurt real cryptos with tech, and real value behind them, so in my eyes if you support doge at all you're earning ""dirty money"" by earning money from hype and hurting everyone elses real investments. Which yes it is a currency meant to not be regulated currently so why can't doge be the next currency and why is it unfair if it is all fair game. Well you have to realize the biggest push behind crypto right now is tech and tech has the best possibility of continuing steady growth with crypto and making a crypto that has no purpose the 2nd highest mover as a joke it really hurts a real chance of crypto being the next currency. So before you think it is all just a joke think about the real life consequences that come with this"
1384,Could you theoretically create another crypto coin that tracks the hash mining rate of another crypto? Like tracking Doge to see how many doge is mined per minute?

1396,"Greetings mate, this is Very Insightful content However personally I feel, those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in stocks / crypto currency world in general or probably just naive, stocks and crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this  , Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions.  I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies / traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, they loose their investment.  'The strongly advise any newbie / traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy.  I underwent series of trading loses'd best not talk about before l was introduced to trading analyst Mr.Elvis Hercules My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able  to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 13k to 50k in just 5 weeks.

They want to create a 2 tier society where they own everything, normal people own nothing. That way anything they have must be 'okayed' by those at the top and any eligibility conditions must be met. It's all about control. If people were allowed to invest in great things and get rich, this wouldn't work since wealth is stored power. This would have still  happened had retail investors not bought Doge. Just the very fact that the elites have pumped it to the moon and retail speculators have the opportunity to jump in and lose their money will be enough for our dictators to come in and stop normal folk from investing.

1890,"What's remarkable about $DOGE is, it's one of the few cryptos that's being talked about, whether it's taken seriously or not.
Nobody from outside the crypto world has ever even heard of the thousands of altcoins, but they might have stumbled upon a mention of $DOGE one way or another. And it doesn't even really matter if all they remember is ""that thing Elon Musk tweeted about"" - they have heard of it, nonetheless.
They know it's out there. It still stands out, even after all these years. It has built a reputation. And now it's gaining practicality/relevancy.
If things go right, it really could become the people's currency. Stranger things have happened.

Ever heard of something so stupid that you somehow just knew it's going to work? Not despite it being so stupid, but because of it?
That's $DOGE for me.

tl;dr:
$DOGE might be the worst cryptocurrency you've ever heard of, BUT you've heard of it."

1899,"Dogecoin took off during the GameStop mania when a Wall Street Bets admin copycat profile on twitter (who made a name for himself cheering on GME all day as it was pumping) took a different direction once the brokerages started putting GME buying on pause. He hinted at the possibility of targeting a crypto currency since that area could not be touched by regulators and tweeted something vaguely referencing Dogecoin. That day it sky rocketed 500% and the doge tweets started catching fire all across twitter, eventually catching Elon Musk's attention later in the evening that day. Elon took it from there and with every tweet dogecoin pumped higher and higher. It's simmered down a bit, but with Elon constantly pumping it who knows where it could go this year."

I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest. Also thanks to Manford who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 6 within 9 weeks. After getting in touch with Manford Campbell; an exp:ert in cryptography, who showed me how to use his program to make transactions and got 27.2 BTC in 9 weeks with him.

2004,"Even as b!tcoin (BTC) is fast approaching res!stance, it remains several tens of thousands of dollars away from entering into “overbought” territory, said a report by the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken published in February 2021. Kraken, among the world’s largest and oldest b!tcoin exchanges, noted that b!tcoin price may gain much higher before the current bull market ends based on historical price movements. “if bitcoin were to surpass $75,000 in the coming few months, historical price action suggests that the digital currency would then be close to the top of the cycle,” it said. Bitcoin’s price has declined from its all-time high of more than $58,000 per coin as of February 21 even as it managed to finish the month 37 per cent higher and outperform its peers. Bitcoin was up 66 per cent year-to-date as of Sunday as it traded at $48,912, according to the data from CoinMarketCap, at the time of filing this report. I'd strongly advise any newbie in trading to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert, I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Burwell Coleman, my contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover and even grow my trading portfolio.

2051,"When it comes to cryptocurrency mostly bitcoin at the moment, there are always two sides, as some people will want the price to fall to it's lower dip for them to buy cheap, while others will hold and wait till it sky rocket for them to sell off, but i really see all this so pointless if it can't yield great result or grow a very strong portfolio. It's clear now that the halving is not what we all imagined and expected initially but the good thing for me was that I did not put all my faith in it as i so much believe in the trading and was able to grow a very strong portfolio... however this i have been doing since the last bear market with Mrs brittany anderson which have proven to be very effective, accurate and profitable. Last month i was able to grow a total of 7BTC having traded with my initial 2BTC with Mrs brittany anderson which you would agree is a very good profit. My advice is for everyone to make use of such signals and strategy so as to grow a very strong portfolio ahead of halving coming soon⏬⏬ You can reach her on

2279,"Most newbies fail simply because they don't understand how the market works in general or in particular how the market relates to stock/forex I believe every stock/forex investor invests for the sole reason of growing their funds and earning higher returns, but these days the forex/stock market is very slow and most people ain't smart enough to know that the best time to buy stocks/forex is when the market is down, A key principle of investing in the stock market is 'buy low and sell high' For example, If a retail trades doesn't grasp what the market makers are doing and when they are doing it, the greatest strategy in the world will fall. For new traders the markets are like entering an F1 race before you've passed your drivers license test. as a beginner it’s not really easy to know the right broker,until I met this man in the store 🏬 when he was talking to a student I head him talking about forex and stock which got my attention to him,I told him my story and he asked me if I’m still interested again which I told him yes. and he started helping me,now at least I am not the best but I am really making a huge profit of $30,000 in a week as I invest,if you are interested please contact him now. he is very honest and trustworthy,contact him now at (elvishercules48@gmail.com)"

2405,"Bitcoin and the entire crypto market have been heavy as of late, with BTC and altcoins alike struggling to gain massive momentum due to the immense selling pressure that bears have been placing on the benchmark crypto. Where the market trends in the days and weeks ahead should depend largely on whether or not bulls can stop BTC from seeing any intense selloff resulting from the recent rejection at $39,000. One trader is now watching to see how BTC responds to $34,000, noting that this is a “line in the sand” that needs to hold for bulls to gain any control over its price action. One trader explained that $34,000 is the key level to watch in the short-term, as a daily close above or below this level could determine Bitcoin’s near-term fate. I have been a horrible tradr up until I saw Burwell Coleman program on trding crypto assets, prior to using his signals I wasn’t doing too great, although I had knowledge on the basics, it wasn’t just enough to kick it in. Burwell showed me how to beat the market, properly manage risk. Within the space of 4 weeks, I have been able to build a great trad!ng portfol\o, am sitting on a trad!ng portfol\o of about 9 btc. I must say, being guided by an expert seems to bridge the hindrance to understanding crypto trading, I would advise every newbie to seek the assistance of an expert before delving into trading any crypto asset. Burwell can be reached on his Wh@tsApp + 1 8 1 5 2 7 7 9 0 5 9"

An expert on crypto currencies posted about the price dynamism of ethereum, he said the market is bound to either go up or down, but the ability for an investor to study the price history and properly access the flow of the market is what is called market analysis and can be done by anyone. Ethereum is gaining momentum above the $1,250 and $1,280 resistance levels. I see only opportunities for holders and traders, although i would go for the latter because its much more profitable. Overtime, i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with my trading and also tried couple of strategies from renowned experts in the trading business. Sebastian has being one of the most resourceful and experienced trader i have come across in recent times, most of my strategies were from him. The fact is with enough determination and guide one can actually trade by themselves, maybe we ought to just get more dedicated in crypto generally. .

2437,"yea, and dogecoin presently is a hot currency for investment. I made a lot of profit as a beginner investing crypto with the most efficient platforms like GPInvestment. As a young or beginner investor, knowing who or what works is best."
2438,"Bitcoin, and crypto for that matter, is very risky. I think of it more as a non-perishable commodity - like gold, platinum etc.- and less as a currency in its basic terms. The difference is that gold and platinum are  commodities that have actual physical uses and it's something you actually get your hands on but crypto isn't.

 Due to the very valuable yet unstable and very unpredictable nature of Bitcoin, people are going to be less and less willing to do basic trade with it for the fear that the value shall rise shortly after they let it go. So Yes, hope is going to make crypto less of a basic currency.

 Consequently, a lot more people will catch up with the realization that Bitcoin is actually not a 'thing' of an actual physical commodity but simply a virtual 'imagination'... and it is at this point that the free falling of the prices of crypto shall be upon us. I predict this happening in about 7 months time.

 My advice, do trade in bitcoin but in the short term. When it reaches an unreasonably high sell it (against all blatant intelligence) and invest in other commodities/ stock."

2484,I must admit this is a great video but you know the forex market is a very volatile one and as such it’s too risky for beginners without adequate tutelage to go into so rather than loose money to bad trades invest with a reputable broker like Mrs Camilla Daniels

Bitcion faced choppy mrkets for most of Tuesday after briefly trading above $56k for the first time during early U.S. trqd!nq hours. With some remaining bullish, I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over.

The Cryptocurrency is known for it's drama and has a history of haters and hardcore fans, which is why it's one of the more controversial Cryptos. The truth is Tron is a well-developed Cryptocurrency with a solid platform and many use cases, they also acquired BitTorrent a year ago and it's functionality is also slowly being integrated into Tron.

Here's the catch, due to Tron's hardcore fans and prominent haters, it's one of those Cryptos that you'll hear a lot about from all sides, and for instance that Email/Letter you received is likely to have been from a third-party and not from the official Tron developers. The truth is, Tron is a great project with a long history of development, I just wanted to clear things up so you don't misinform other people about the project and it's progress in the years, because this could harm long term investors as well as what people think of the Crypto before doing their own research.

PS: I've been studying Cryptocurrencies full-time as a University student for the past 3 years so I'm quite informed about the ecosystem and the in-depth details of each Crypto in the Top 50s. This is to clarify why I am able to know this is most likely the case with your situation.

Edit: Also the point of Elon Musk and his tweets correlating to the price action of dodge is not a healthy point, this could be said as a Pump & Dump as the majority of the price increase is from celebrity tweets. Also since I do know the Crypto sphere quite well, Elon musk has accumulated Doge himself since last year (which he has Tweeted about Doge before), and the price increases only make him and other long term holders profitable while as noobies entering the space will lose a lot of their money as the price fluctuates and ""eventually"" decreases to a less hyped up value."

2885,CB for MVP great video bro!
2886,Here’s what happened. Big money went in deep into DOGE around 7 cents+ not knowing what the fuck they were doing and the real players dumped on them. Now they want their money back so they’re desperately trying to pump it back up with exposure. What they don’t understand is the top 12 wallets own more than 50% of all the DOGE in circulation. It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to beat them. They own the coin. They make it rise and they make it fall. Period.

3008,Is this an ad for Dogecoin?
3009,I thought that this was just a  game XD.
3010,"DOGE is trash. All it has going for it is it’s meme status.

3011,Doge its joke

3021,I know that you are doing this with little knowledge and declare that this is not financial advice but this video is extremely dangerous doge coin has 0 utility in the real world and hence when adoption of crypto occurs this coin will fall in price dramatically. Even declaring that it is financial advice is not enough people will still follow what you say as fact and people may lose thousands.

3520,To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
3521,Dogecoin has no purpose. Like Bitcoin. It's only a store of value. Noobs typically start investing in coins like this. Do your research. There's better projects than this.
3522,"Weirdly doge coin fixes a major flaw that Bitcoin has though Bitcoin acts like the flaw is a positive. This being that Bitcoin is finite while more dogecoins are constantly being created. It’s impossible for Bitcoin to actually become the future currency because it’s finite and therefore deflationary. Basically no one will spend it because they think it will go up in value and who wants to pay for a pizza with it when that Bitcoin they spend could be worth 10 million dollars one day. Doge coin is inflationary and actually slightly loses value same as real currency’s therefore people can happily buy things with it knowing they aren’t going to want to jump out a window when they see what it’s worth in the future. People can buy doge coin and say they are buying it as a currency. People buying Bitcoin can’t really say that, they are in it just to make money, ie hope someone else thinks it’s worth more in the future.

Also doge coin is ten times faster at transactions than Bitcoin. Another major flaw."

3562,"Will Rogers did not win and never officially ran for president.  He never received a single vote.  He ran a joke campaign through a humor magazine and declared a fake victory and then fulfilled his only campaign promise and resigned.  This is sloppy to use this information even if it came from another video.   Kind of disappointed that someone with your gravitas would put in bad information about history......if something sounds kind of weird (ie. someone winning the presidency and then resigning), fact check it......"
3563,I mean did he say anything about this being awesome financial advice?
3564,So he brought up the topic of not promoting  Tron but ended up promoting it. Bravo!
3565,Such a scam coin 🤣🤷‍♂️
3566,"Dodge? Dutch?

3567,Love those transitions
3568,Let’s goooooo baby 🚀🚀
3569,you are more of a tech guy.  U are not into investing. your opinion really doesn't makes a lot of impact.
3570,"Take it from someone who has been in the scene for a long ass time. Doge is not worth crap. It has too high of an emission rate and there is no cap on how many of them will be minted. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it is not a smart investment. One day the demand will slow down because people will lose interest in this joke and the supply will outgrow the demand. Combining the doge  and dollar inflation, you are essentially losing 5-6% of your value every year by holding doge assuming that the demand stays steady, which it most likely won't. The only reason it's pumping right now is because Elon is abusing his platform to push it up.

 Also do not listen to people saying to hold until stimulus package money comes out, that is already priced in. Buy the rumour, sell the news and don't let the FOMO get to you. 

People who think Dogecoin will hit a dollar in this run are absolutely delusional. They obviously don't understand how cryptocurrencies are valued or they are just trying to get suckers to buy their shitcoin. This is what is scary about this space during bull runs. We are most likely going to see a wave of suicides soon because of this kind of shit. People are going to keep hyping this shit up until the bubble bursts without ever realizing any gains and it IS going to burst, nobody knows when but it will. Everybody is on a high right now and the comedown is going to be BRUTAL. If you've made a lot of ""profit"", take some out. Doesn't matter if the price keeps going up after you've sold, if you're new to the scene, you have no idea how fast this can come crashing down.


Anyway, I don't know why I bothered commenting in a youtube comments section but whatever. Whoever is reading this, if you're new to crypto, please keep what I've said in mind."

3594,"Etherium, Cardano, Neo, and others have ways of writing crypto contracts, which are basically programs that run directly on the blockchain and powered by money. These are significant differences from standard Bitcoin. Dogecoin is basically a rebranded Bitcoin. In electronics terms, if Bitcoin is a landline, Cardano and Etherium are smartphones. They all can make and receive phone calls but, smartphones (Cardano, Etherium, and others) have apps that do way more than just have a conversation. Whole industries are being built off of these blockchain contract apps in the same way industries have popped up around smartphone apps (Tinder, Venmo, Uber, Free-to-Play Games, etc)."

3601,I brought doge coin when it was .007 cent in 2019.
3602,Dogecoin is the definition of an investment with no fundamentals
3603,"not so bad at all ? 10k Doge is being minted every minute and theres never going to be a halving,  Doge couldn't hold its value in a bull market, let alone bear market which is on its way."
3604,"What people are missing is value is whatever people accepts. Sure doge is a joke now but people liking it is all it need to turn into something serious. It does function like bitcoin, it's actually faster. So you never know what people may choose to use in the future"

3612,"Love the concept of the video and just providing some light commentary.

""Alt coin"" is misleading terminology created back in 2017/18. The value of all the tokens you showed from Coinbase provide different benefits within the crypto/blockchain space. For example, Graph indexes different blockchains, Aave provides loans, Uniswap provides token liquidity, and Ethereum provides a protocol from which others can build new products on top of it. The tokens are a way for people to have stake in the growth of the assets. Would love to share more. I work at Arca (ar.ca), which has been researching and investing in this space from the beginning."

3787,"Bitcoin will never be a currency of any sort. A currency cant be an investment, it can only be a hedge against another currency. Bitcoins value is sky high because it's speculative and there's promising returns, but thats EXACTLY what a Currency cannot have. Currency needs to be steady. Volatility is the enemy of Currency. A seller will not accept say 1/10000th a Bitcoin if in 10 seconds, the value of that could tank. A buyer wont pay in Bitcoin knowing that tomorrow $100 of Bitcoin may skyrocket to $500 and you thought you paid $100 for sneakers, but you actually paid $500. Such a buyer would immediately demand a refund. There'd be refunds and returns and lawsuits up the ass. When companies deal with different currency risks, they negotiate how to hedge that risk and that requires Credit Default Swaps and all sorts of Puts and Calls with collars to lock in a currency exchange rate. That's not gonna happen every time i want to buy a TV. 

Additionally, in order for Bitcoin to become steady, it needs to lose its volatility totally. If and when that happens people will stop buying it cause there's no chance for gains. People pay $50k for Bitcoin cause they think its going to $100K. If thats done, then Bitcoin will tank. Stability is the enemy of Bitcoin."

3805,"Who cares about Bitcoin? It might increase in value, and there you or some other people will be happy for a short while. But people, need to wake up and smell the giant turd we are all worshipping...

If you invest in something which does not have an exchange between 2 parties, where there is NOT an actual product. Then ultimately, it does not benefit the survival of the human race. Because we are creating artifical value, without having produced a product. And plus we have polluted mother earth to support our scheme; crypto minning using a lot of electricity.
(That makes it an unethical currency, because it is going to take more and more electricity to makes it worth running a crypto minning function. So that maybe in 10-20 years, you are going to need to generate maybe 10x more electricity to just earn your money back of your investment)

And imagine this: that maybe 50% of us go over to bitcoin in the future. How will that help us buy groceries and other stuff like money does, if no one is there to produce them?
It is so primitive that people haven't figured this out yet.

It is a non sustainable currency that will at some point collapse, simply because it requires too many ressources to harvest, and it does not leave a product behind, so that the human race can evolve.

Currently Bitcoin is just a temporary hack, for some few people that can benefit from it. In other words. It is just a fake currency that cheats the system for a small period, until people realise that it is not worth it and harming humanity."

3807,"Thanks, this was informative. I think Doge is funny and i can easily see myself put €10k just for the fun of it! And i agree with you, that because this is sort of a joke and it can get away with a lot of stuff, it can also have a true potential to become something good/big, at least do much better than 95% of the other Altcoins. I’m not invested in any cryptocurrency yet, but i have intentions to do that, once i am more familiar with them. In the meantime, dogs and Doge FTW!"

Most of us were Robinhood users, didnt turn out well. You know what else didnt turn out well? Trump, Schwarzenegger... god evan the famous Monica Lewinsky. Get real and dont follow what the rich tll you, dont be a puppet. Invest ahead and think wisely, but what is low so it goes high. I am no rocket scientist, but I am pretty positive a society stuck in a pandemic and fear will have nothing better to do than have faith in our ""leaders"", except our leaders hold the puppet strings. Be smart, dont be a part of the problem the rich will want."

3862,Marcus mentioning Tron in the video may have been his little sponsorship 🤔
3863,Doge has a current circulating supply of 128 billion. For it to hit $1 the market cap has to reach 128 billion (its currently at 6.5bish). In addition 5 billion doge are released each year with an infinite overall supply. These are just a few of the many problems with it. Im all in on crypto but doge just fundamentally doesn’t work compared to the other altcoins out there. Definitely a lot of profit potential but solely for the fact that its a meme
3864,Wait wat movie he was talkin about??
3865,:-/
3866,I am proud
3867,"You should do more of these BTC videos.  I'm sure that a lot of your viewers are already following BTC anyways.  You can stay away from any other alt-coins unless if someone like Elon tweets or talks about it.
Perhaps, setting up an alt-coin called Joke-Coin, Meme-Coin or Do-Not-Buy-Coin, isn't such a bad idea after all? 🙂"
3868,BTC attracts the cream of the crop and the bottom of the barrel. But I just love the way you explain any concept Marques -- your objectivity is unparalleled on YouTube.
3869,Please don't invest in altcoins.
3870,People like Elon tweeting about Dogecoin as of it's a real currency has tricked people into thinking it's worth investing which inevitably lost them money. This needs to end before more people lose money. Cryptocurrency will never be more than a currency for illegal purchase. No public institution will ever switch over to crypto because the federal reserve will never accept it which make it useless for real world purchases.
3871,I think I might be good at the stock market... I have a weak pull out game..

Pun obviously intended"
3931,"Will Rogers 1928 won Presidency as a joke, which says a lot about today's elections as well. You promise the sky, and don't deliver. And interestingly the one who actually delivered on more of their promises happens to be Trump, and look at what huge opposition he received for it, plus assassination attempts. He delivered way more than any recent President, way more than Obama or W. Bush. But even he failed to deliver on a few big things, mainly due to the opposition from the democrats ruling the congress. Presidency has really become a joke, and we'd need more Will Rogers to point out the ridiculousness of it all."

3936,"Plenty better financial advice on youtube than on some financial news program that exists to gather the sheeple for a trap. The #1 advice I go for is to stay the heck away from it, cos the game is rigged against the little guy."
3937,"This was horrible advice. You literally promoted Doge and disparaged Tron in the most lightweight of capacities - celeb endorsements. Do you not buy Bitcoin because you don't listen to Meg? No one cares if celebs were paid to talk up Tron. What they care is that Tron has a functional blockchain with lower fees for building dApps, NFTs, wallets, and DeFi. You know what Doge DOES NOT have.... dApps, NFTs, and DeFI. Because it's a joke coin. You're going to have to take an L on this video. Like Dadpool said... Doge = rekt city and you just helped pump it with an irrational endorsement based on NOTHING because in 8 or so years Doge has zero investment but Tron - you found sketch in an email - actually has business development. UGH stick with gadgets. You're out of your league."
3938,The owner of Tron Justine or Justin-correct me if I’m wrong-is well hated by the Chinese crypto environment for his sketchy play and ruining the whole thing by caring nothing but money.

When something moons like this, sorry, you are too late. My advise if you are planning to go in the Crypto Mar:ket is you should trade with a wise approach rather than buying Crypto, holdin it to make gain and then get disappointed by an imminent crash in a few weeks. Over the past year I have been able to make 13+BTC following the instructions and s!gnals from Dominic Yaroslav, He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradN Bitcoin works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto mar:ket and also stack up more Crypt0.

4037,I thought it was pronounced dog-e like doggy.
4038,Doge is a fork of litecoin with more supply so much less value. Not much utility.  Tron is actually a great project. Instant transfer and free to send.  Plus smart contracts like eth but without the ridiculous fees.  Download Klever wallet to see how crypto works.  Who knows if Justin or someone in Tron sent that email because it could have been a competitor or someone wanting to increase their value.  If Justin did do it then maybe he saw Elon do it and thought why not have celebrities promote Tron and not thinking that people can see through it.

2. The Doge4Water and Jamaican bobsled team fundraisers were not funded by the creators, they were funded by the community."

4059,"As a crypto guy for 5 years, I should say most of your opinions are correct. But I'm not sure about if it's ok to pulish business emails then diss the program. Tons of crypto guys are working their asses off to chase their dreams in their own ways, maybe the business emails is one of those ways. I am one of those guys who don't like Tron as you do, but I think we should show some respect to everyone's work, especially when it goes pulice. Peace."
4060,thank you
4061,Doge will never be $1 because that would make its market cap higher than bitcoins market cap and personally I think that is never going to happen

4071,its not a currency ...
4072,John Candy rocks. 🙌
4073,Dogecoin is Reddit currency now I guess

4079,Stocks are good but I swapped and invested in  crypto currency (Bitcoin) I have been earning much from it  people will be kicking themselves in regret in few weeks if they miss this opportunity of buying and investing in Bitcoin
4080,"I love MKBHD videos, very informative, this was very funny, your videos always make my day!  Great with the morning coffee!  Thank you.

One of these days I'll need to purchase some swag and rock one of your t-shirts or a hoodie.  I'm sure they'll go great with my laid back 24/365 Reef flip-flop style."

4087,To the MOOOOON
4088,I feel like dogecoin went up after this video
4089,What about Pi coin?
4090,"Dogecoin is Bitcoin. The more money you throw into Dogecoin actually drives the price of Bitcoin up while at the same time Dogecoin continues to trade sideways, or as of late, drop because more stock holders are selling and getting out. So, STOP buying Dogecoin cause you're just getting ripped off."
4091,Yeah... linsey Lohan... that’s a low...
4092,"DOGE does not have a good upside potential. It was created as a joke because it IS a joke. The coin supply is massive and is highly inflationary (growing 14m a day with a very slightly decreasing rate of inflation). Bitcoin on the other hand is highly deflationary with a maximum of 21 million coins that will ever exist.
People think DOGE is a good investment but mathematically it is not. It is virtually impossible to hit $50 with DOGE because then it’d have a market cap 8x bigger then Bitcoin.  DOGE market cap would be 4-5 times bigger then Apple or Amazon... 
This was one of your worst videos MKBHD... You have incredible influence and you used it to shill a pointless coin... You should have instead done the opposite of what you were saying and actually discuss the DOPE TECH and merits that so many alt coins actually have. Cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, and decentralized finance is the opportunity of our lifetimes, much like the dotcom boom was a couple decades ago."
4093,When Amanda Cerny gets called out in an MKBHD video for her endless paid pumps lol. She's always posting some crypto or ticker and now we see this email offering her money for it.
4094,"Doge is garbage, super inflationary and a lot of people are going to lose money."

4099,i have a little over 4100 dogecoin.  its been kinda concerning seeing it dip from .08 to .05 but I'm a newbie to the crypto world.  just hold and forget about it for a few months and check in.  thats the plan
4100,"If I had a disposable income I'd get into cryptocurrency but instead I'm stuck in college and all I get to do is miss out. Though I think I'd rather get in on stocks and stuff first, but I'd like to get some cryptocurrency too. I like the idea of crypto, and I hope some day it becomes the new way we do money."
4101,Did MKBHD just revield his cryptos portfolio?
4102,The only difference between Will Rogers and Donald Trump was that the latter actually took office.
4103,"totally unknown Crypto people: hey let's pay MKBHD to make our crypto super known & rise above all in matter of seconds

4121,*I think this is legal advice and MKBHD is a liable professional*
4122,"I have like 1500 doge coins, i invested in it just for the meme tbh... If it turns into profit, then great. If it doesnt then who cares lol, never invest more than you can afford loosing. 
But i do know that some sort of cryptocurrency is the future, wether it be dogecoin, bit coin, Ethereum, whatever... Our current economy wont make sense when we eventually become a multi-planetary species. Our economy is based on resources, and for now we are limited to resources on earth. But space got an unlimited amount of resources and if those resources gets added to our economy then the whole economy collapses."
4123,So you said yes to the Tron offer?
4124,Are you changing your setup?

4130,"Yh buy doge, but don't invest in doge. Ya dig?"
4131,So what your saying is that I still have a chance? Lol honestly just like Elon said it's the people's crypto.

4134,"im pretty sure it's pronounced dog-ee-coin, marques"
4135,Buy cardano noobs
4136,Deja vu. Just repeated what Graham said.
4137,Dogecoin won't succeed. It's a pump & dump relying on hype. Once people like Elon stop clowning around and the market stabilizes it will go bo back down. It will never be a useful coin.
4138,"Just bought €100,00 dogecoin 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
4139,"I think the most interesting part for me about these is that they aren't all just pointless coins/cryptocurrencies.
 
They're entire decentralized ecosystems with different technologies all bidding to be part of the future. It's the internet of finance not tied down to a single entity or currency. 

The beginning of the internet was hard to understand, but we can't see the world without it now. It is what email is to sending letters. It is what crypto is to foreign exchanges. 

Crypto will be the future. With 20%+ of ALL USD being created just last year, it is hard to see fiat currency being sustainable... It's time to move forward."

4147,Invest in “money” to make “money”......🙃
4148,"Funny how ppl thought that BTC wouldn't be worth anything back in 2007. There was someone who traded 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas. 10,000 BTC back then in today's market is worth $490,000,000.00"
4149,"Cardano is the future, I’m dead serious. I’m not saying to invest in it, that’s something you have to decide yourself, I’m just excited for the future with Cardano. Decentralizing the world and giving access to financial institutions to 50% of the world who have no access to banks"
4150,What about Trumpcoin?
4151,This did not explain Dogecoin at all.
4152,"Buy low and sell high.. pretty simple, or if u miss out on the sell just hold and sell the next time.. its constantly going up and down"

Useless random fact, Cool Runnings was the  movie I went to the first time I went on a date with a girl."
4163,doge can easily be hit by a 51% attack... why dont you people research fundamentals and how this things work before going publicly with 'something: explained'...
4164,"7:18 LOL LOL , thanks for your honesty in your opinions. I own doge and I hope they develop a good crypto software that can deliver a service or have great value."
4165,"I love that you trashed Tron. Even it's founder called it a ""shitcoin"" :')
However, vast majority of Altcoins are not competing with Bitcoin. They are dealing with stuff like sensitive data sharing, lending & other financial services,  bridges between different blockchains so they are able to ""communicate, energy sharing, distribution and monitoring, supply chain solutions, brand recognition and much much more. 
Great video tho!"
4166,I just dropped 5K in there because of you!!!! You da best Marquis!💙

4174,"it just dipped quite a bit down to 0.03, if you're gonna put a few bucks in, now's the time. It was 0.08 a week ago."
4175,"Dogecoin has a market cap of almost $7 billion. It can't grow by much any longer.
I've been looking lately into Wynaut, it's touted off as being Dogecoin 2.0, with better tech behind it. Right now it's at $0.05, but it will most likely be $1 in around 1 week, because the project is gaining traction quickly. I think you guys should look into this.
 LIKE SO MORE PEOPLE CAN SEE!"
4176,So I see how you want to know how your influence will affect this dogecoin?
4177,"It wasn't mentioned in the video, so be sure to research the environmental impact of proof of work or ""mined"" crypto currencies.

I don't think it's fair to call crypto harmless.

Dear cryto-fan who tries to ""educate me"": just... stop"
4178,That's the best financial advice I've ever not received.
4179,Marques got stuck holding the doge bags.
4180,It’s funny how each disclaimer is jacketless.
4181,"I bought dogecoin when it first came out and the community is what keeps me holding. It's fun, and people share it and spend it, rather than game the system for profit like it's shares. Unless they're holding like me 😅"

4193,"TRON (trx) is absolute trash. Justin Sun the CEO is just as much of a joke as Craig Wright in the space. Steer clear. 
Definitely DYOR . There are plenty of great projects looking to make a tangible difference to improving our future in some way or another. I'd recommend looking at something like Cardano if you're interested in something built by scientists, engineers & mathematicians that is peer reviewed & about to make a huge real world difference in places that need this tech like Africa. 
Good luck to everyone investing in crypto, it's a wild ride!"
4194,"Garbage coin with no practical use case or utility. Better be very careful investing in this if you decide to, it will not maintain its value long term."

4223,"Maaaan that shit about Will Rogers is pretty far from the truth, he did NOT win any election. He claimed he did as a bit. You can find this out with like a two minute Google search. Should fact check this kind of stuff in the future."

4244,"Let's face it Marques, a lot of influencers take themselves too seriously and will shill anything they are paid to.  So I appreciate your pretty objective commentary on the Doge phenomenon.   I really wish Elon would stay out of plugging Doge or Bitcoin.  If he really wants to do something then maybe he should have his Teslas use any excess braking energy for mining Doge and/or Bitcoin and sell some ""I brake for DOGE!"" bumper stickers."

4247,If you're at all interested in crypto check out Guy's videos at Coin Bureau - he's not a financial advisor either but seems to do good at picking successful projects.
4248,Can we create an MKBHDcoin which has its value pegged to the revenue of your YT channel? 😁
4249,"Yes! Dogecoins' parameters are great: The 1-minute block interval allows for a 10x transaction throughput compared to Bitcoin, without significantly affecting the blockchain's security when compared to Bitcoin. The faster block interval moreover allows accepting transactions faster (similar to Ethereum). That's what I studied in 2016 in my Ph.D. thesis and paper ""On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains"". (I currently do not hold Dogecoins)"
4250,How do I buy a dogecoin?

4273,"Doge is the chimera or werewolf of cryptocurrencies. One day it's a worthless joke, the next it's a viral meme, until people get bored of the joke and it goes back to sleep and being laughed at again. That's why traders love it. You buy it when everybody treats it as a joke then sell when it goes viral again. 

Memes are powerful but wear off quickly. Even Elon's tweets are starting to have no effect. What Elon is planning is the question, maybe he can train it to be a grown up doggie. Only buy what you can afford to lose 90% of."

He was one of the most famous Americans of the time.  He was a regular star of the Ziegfeld Follies as well as having a daily column in the New York Times as well as another column in the Saturday Evening Post.

Rogers didn't win the 1928 election.  He ran as a joke with what he called the ""Anti-Bunk"" party.  Everybody knew it was a joke.  He even said that should he actually win, he would immediately resign, which was essentially his only campaign promise.  So when the election happened, he simply declared himself the winner and resigned.

He did not actually win.  He wasn't even on the ballot."

4306,"First time I'm a little disappointed in an MKBHD video. You dumb down the value of a crypto to a popularity contest, but while that might be part of the equation, there's way more going on. BTC has value because of scarcity, ETH has value because of smart contacts."
4307,Thank u for the info but what happened to the sound quality lately?
4308,Fun fact: in January 2014 the trading volume of Dogecoin surpassed that of all other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.

4320,"I love this! So glad to see someone share the real story here, it’s been a bit murky with all the scammers and bulls jumping in. Doge community is AMAZING. And there are some technical advantages: low fees, fast transactions times, and it’s easy to mine. I’m honestly so anxious to hear from the developers, possible podcast topic? Thank you for making this video, it makes me so happy!!"
4321,"I cannot believe  my fav tech guy did a video on Doge. I hold 20,000 shares and I know one day it will make me a millionaire but all I really want is a tiny house in the country. Thanks! I love your channel!"

4335,Dogecoin 💎
4336,"it's pronounced ""doggy"""
4337,That's kinda funny how one Tweet from Elon Musk can cause a spike in Dogecoin.

4384,I thought those coins were bullshit
4385,6:43 thank you Marques
4386,"I've been interested in cryptocurrencies since 2017 when I saw the scarcity of video cards, because I always followed the hardware market, but I never put my face to it, this month I started, bought some bitcoin at a good price, bought etherum too, I bought dogecoin too, I confess that it devalued a little, I lost a little money at the moment it is worth the currency, but in bitcoin and etherum I made a profit, this is very good to have an experience of you following the market, of currencies, of shares, one hour you lose, another hour you win and much more than the profit over the loss, very good indeed.
Marques B. buy some Dogecoins there and share on twitter, or just spread your video there with hashtag doge hehe"
4387,Don't tell me you didn't read doggeycoin
4388,The inflation of doge coin is pretty steep though so maybe not the best currency to start with. The inflation will slow though if the 5 billion coins per year limit stays in place.

4394,It's basically a shit coin
4395,"You really really disappointed me for the first time in 10 years of your videos. 
You've really haven't done research on what is what.
I can clearly see that you've just caught up with hype. 
The ""financial expert"" you talked about he knows as much as you know of crypto. 
Coming Elon he tweets on Doge but he actually bought $1.5 billion with of Bitcoin but not Doge for a reason. You literally took it serious when Elon isn't. 
And Alt coins there are ten thousand+ of them but there are thousand of them which are not just cryptocurrencies but technological revolutions.
Doge coin creators doing the right thing ""because they hold more than 60% of the coins"".
I would not have disappointed with you making this video just as you did all of your videos with "" complete knowledge and depth understanding"" but you've just gone with the wind for this video. 

I'm sorry but I'm really really really really very much disappointed as your long long follower who never doubted your videos."
4396,hey. i’ve been trying everyday and researching to get the ps5. i can’t afford the ones that are over $500. i will pay you the $500 for the ps5. i will do anything. im one of youre biggest fans. please get back to me🥺 if you cant i understand.

4410,"i see doge, i hit like"
4411,"All good points and good overview. It's funny how dogecoin affected litecoin mining in GPUs back in the day. It was more profitable to mine that even if it was a ""joke"" satire"
4412,"Back in September 2020 I put $400 into DOGE, when my friend asked why, I told him that every time Elon tweeted about Crypto, it goes up

Now it's at a high I never thought it would reach

If you really want it to go up, don't just invest in it, use it, I'm working on setting  up my side business website and registered Dogecoin payment services, I also started taking Dogecoin tips on my Twitch, weird to think this is a currency that people can use, but it is, and I love to get paid in memes"
4413,Love your content!

4429,Um... Good video
4430,“Someone named Will Rogers...”.  Will Rogers was not just “someone”.
4431,Doge has unlimited supply. It’s designed to not be worth anything. I’m amazed he didn’t mention that. It has deflation built into it and doge is a joke both in its image but functionally.
4432,Marques you're a great kid but global currency is a horrific idea.

4452,"It feels like something that people misunderstand about DogeCoin is that its supply increases by 13 million coins/day. That does not make it very viable as an expensive crypto. But yeah, it's fun (but people are gonna get hurt, maybe partly because of this video, and definitely because of Elon).
Great exposing Tron, though!"

4460,you should make more of these videos
4461,Marques these videos are really awesome! I think you should open another channel for these types of videos. Just a suggestion. Who agree?
4462,"How is it possible that a company like Apple was the one that innovated and the others copied themselves from it and now today those who innovate are Xiaomi, Huawei and Samsung and to see if the three cameras change in the iPhone and its own boring design  3 years old and that blessed nouch that no one of his competition left him a while ago is in the past"

4470,Avoid Tron like the plague. If they need celebs to tweet for them that means their product is shit.
4471,Decentralized Online Global Economy
4472,"You know right, that if just 1 Exahash of mining power detaches from bitcoin to attack dogecoin or other shitcoins, they can ANNIHILATE everyone's investment on them just by messing with transactions, generating more coins and shit? But nobody does it because it costs money to attack shitcoins also, so mining bitcoin is more profitable in general."
4473,Dogecoin to the moon 🚀🚀
4474,is this financial advice tho? 😂
4475,"You clearly don't know a lot about cryptocurrency. 

Which is fine but if you are going to make a video explaining a phenomenon within the crypto world, you should do your research and understand how the technology works."

4485,"Well crypto lovers, While you are here check out btt. No financial advise ofc. Just a heads up. 

Edit: Haha or dont, just finished the video. BTT is from the  TRON network, not the best move tron haha."
4486,Altcoins are by and large scams to cash in on the success of Bitcoin.

I love the internet."
4506,...I interviewed with TRON for a marketing position back in 2018. So glad I went elsewhere. They seem so damn sketchy...
4507,your a bit late man
4508,Knew that tweet from Linday Lohan was forced
4509,"I think it should be enough to say Elon Musk sent a twit about it and end of the video. This is the kind of stuff that make cryptocurrencies never be viable as it is now. A famous guy sends a twit about it and profits some money with it based on nothing.
This boom of crypto only came again after 2-3 years after the last boom because now there is some significant improvement in the GPU power and the majority can't buy it, making like a loop of demand and supply."
4510,"Why do I think the bitcoin bubble will ""explode"" soon."
4511,"Let's get Doge ""all the way up""!"
4512,1st it's not a random crypto doge existed for years and no Doge wont reach 1$ any time soon... the question is will it ever reach 1$...
4513,MKBHD sounds like he was having a canker sore
4514,"Thanks! I’ve seen so much and read so much, it’s nice to hear a simplified conversational explanation. Keep it up! MKBHD Explains!"

4516,Ouuuuu my man must've bought it!
4517,"My father told me of a conversation he had with a millionaire acquaintance of his several decades ago. When asked how to make money, the millionaire responded ""Making millions of dollars is like breeding rabbits. It's much easier when you start with two."""
4518,Exposed Tron!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
4519,"Buy and hold DOGE! I bought back in June 2020 and I'm happy now that I did lol. Sitting at 5x the amount I invested in right now, with so much more room for growth. I don't think it's too far fetched for it to grow another 5x to reach $1. The fact that Elon Musk and Mark Cuban are speaking on it and acknowledging it, it shouldn't be taken as a joke! Even if it doesn't have much ""intrinsic value"", who cares? Let's all make some money lol!"
4520,Who else was in to Dogecoin years ago wayyyy before it became mainstream and will make a killing of this takes off?
4521,"That's all fun and stuff, but this was one reason why economic systems were invented and agreed on - so there's no uncertaincy when exchanging one thing for another. Money back in the day were hooked to gold, and now it's bonded to GDP. 
But with all this cryptocurrency circus when literally anyone with very little knowledge can create his own currency and start selling it - how should we define if that's of value and not just a die-soon random sparkle that will probably make some people lose their (yet) real money?"
4522,Love to hear your input on Doge. Couldn't have explained it any better!
4523,"Lmaooo you truly did expose Tron a bit. It was pretty funny

But Dogecoin being a meme, there are many moments where the price goes up causing people to invest a for a short period and lose thousands."
4524,who else bought Dodge after seeing the video?
4525,"Check out Hedera Hashgraph it isn’t based on the same fundamentals like every other alt coin is, it’s new tech. LOOK INTO IT"
4526,DogeCoin was created in 2013.

4530,"This reminds me of when Yo! (the app to literally say ""yo"" to someone)  got announced on Product Hunt. It was kind of a joke, but it morphed into actually being a company and I think they even got VC money. It fizzled out later, but had its 15 mins of fame."

4535,"please never use the word ""invest"" with anything related to cryptocurrencies it should be treated as gambling because that's all it is. If more people continue to gamble and you make money because you cash out before they lose their money, that does not make it an investment. That's a pyramid scheme."
4536,invest in any cryptocurrency if you enjoy investing solely on speculation

They hacked dorami who is kind of a big youtuber, and his channel was renamed, ""Justin Sun."" Don't give them any information, and don't give them anything because they have hacked multiple youtubers channels. They have these live streams telling and teaching people how to hack into other peoples online banking services and it is a live stream that is put on loop over and over. Be safe, and be smart Marques."
4544,Wth is wrapped bitcoin. It's actually more expensive than bitcoin
4545,"If there’s one thing I learned here, it’s that Marques is definitely giving legally binding financial advice."
4546,Phenomeal Wark men😂😂
4547,"What percentage of the population do you think has really any clue about crypocurrency?  1% or 2%, maybe.  Crypto's primary attributes, being virtual and volatile, will keep it at arms length, at least for the foreseeable future for most investors.  And your comments about Musk and his Tweeting about Dogecoin are relevant.  Elon got smacked pretty hard by the SEC for running his jaws on Twitter previously, and if he's not careful, he's going to find himself in their crosshairs again as his tweets move stock prices."
4548,Why doesn’t anyone call it Dog-e-coin??? Feels like i’m taking crazy pills
4549,"do your research. will rogers ran for president, but didnt come close to winning"
4550,Wow much money and knowledge
4551,"Am I the only one that notices a bit of a different speaking in Marq's voice? Like he had some dentistry done and now he is all "" Ssss SSss Ssss """
4552,1:30-2:00 doesn't sound right...are you trying to say they're all based on the same thing because they are cryptocurrencies and not regular currencies? Most alt coins are not based on Bitcoin lol
4553,good music. host looks like he is pretending to understand the subject. out of depth.
4554,"The thing is - they are not build equally - they have different security, different capabilities, different APIs, different people behind, adoption, etc. - the fundamentals. And the fundamentals of Doge Coin are bad af - it's not secure, it's has less features, it's not developed actively, there is no cap to the amount of coins that can be created, etc. - adoption is the only fundamental. Technologywise it's a joke and never will be more - and shouldn't be - it's f# bad."
4555,Dogecoin is a meme coin
4556,That was such a good movie
4557,Marques needs to go on The Iced Coffee Hour!!!
4558,"I believe we should pronounce it as ""Doggy"" and not ""Dodge"". 🐶"
4559,What I understood from this was to invest before its too late 😂
4560,"Give us the scoop , what did Elon say to you behind the scenes , woof woof ! When Mars !"
4561,"What do you expect from Justin Sun? All he knows is tweet about his Tron hoping it will go to the moon!!  Haha LoL
Dump dump dump!"
4562,"Not a financial advisor and no experience, giving guidance LOLOLOL"
4563,When tech channel become an investment channel...hmmm
4564,Woof woof Elon Muskrat
4565,What's the name of the movie again?
4566,Recently Amanda cerny also posted/tweeted  about farm laws  of india that was also shocking now i understand they are getting Money for this Shame!
4567,Marques I think it’s also worth to point out...Doge was literally designed to lose value. That’s a large and important part of the joke as well.
4568,I would say you just got it's price higher. Mark my words.
4569,"I must be way older than I thought I was, based only on the fact a Cool Runnings reference needs explaining now"
4570,Trump is the Modern Dodgecoin of politicians
4571,Hello all owners of doge coin! Please swallow your pride and do some more research so that you can actually take part in this amazing flip of the globe’s wealth. Doge will not be part of this. It is a joke and you will regret it !

4579,"Marques I would recommend you advertise the Tech stuff..  I know a guy Maxx ""High on Android"" ( had near million subscribers) Maxx was advertising about Crypto World. Maxx got his channel shut down from YouTubers complaining misleading..."
4580,LMAO EXPOSED TRON
4581,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
4582,"Definitely wasn’t expecting this kind of video from you, but it was good"
4583,How do I even buy dogecoin?
4584,Spoiler: marques tells us he's gonna release his own cryto.
4585,Sold all doges at 0.8 and went all in  BTC lol
4586,How will 127 billion dogecoins worth anymore than it worths now?
4587,"Don't just ride it to the moon, ride it through the stars, into a black hole and into the next universes! XD"
4588,Such coin. Much money. Wow!
4589,"I bet that Marques bought a shit ton of Dogecoin and lost a good amount of money 
now he tries to make the value to go up by doing that"
4590,Great video! and cool running is awesome movie ;)
4591,"Way to make assumptions on a guy using the same tools you do for marketing... I mean i couldn't care less about the marketing strategies if the tech is better then the current ethereum BC, you know which coin got discredited before rising? Bitcoin."
4592,stellar!!!! XLM FOREVER
4593,wouldn't be surprised if elon musk also commented about dogecoin on this video too.
4594,ADA to the MOON 🚀🚀😂
4595,"Ellon Musk is shitting over the poor common people that are tired of day to day hard work. He is pulling them into the trap. Ellon Musk is just a very bad, mean person who either does this to make a huge profit or he is enjoying looking people get into the trap and cry."
4596,"Kudos on bringing more attention to the Crypto world. However, to say that all altcoins are just tweaks of the same basic principle is misleading to your audience. There are many coins that were built from the ground up with vastly different purposes than just being a currency. Ethereum, ChainLINK, UniSwap to name three are not currencies at all and have real-world purpose.

Because they all use blockchain does not make them principally the same."
4597,"I really think this guy bought doge coin, then uploaded a video to sell after its popularity. This really has nothing to do with his channel."
4598,"I remember when Doge bought out ad space on a Nascar stock car, and have been a fan ever since. My 40k coins are holding strong!"
4599,DOGE IS WORTHLESS OMFG.... HOW IS A SHITCOIN MEME GETTING THIS MUCH COVERAGE WHEN REAL TECH EXISTS THAT HAS VALUE LIKE BITCOIN OR ETHEREUM....
4600,Question do you think your gonna buy doge coin
4601,Those cuts were unique and interesting 👌
4602,I have a bro who’s investing in dogecoin and wants to stick it to Wall Street
4603,People who know it by memeulous
4604,would you please make a video on PI coin and Bee Coin
4605,Marques told me to buy Dogecoin....😂
4606,I just did a double take on your last name and realized I’ve been reading it as browniee instead of brownlee lol
4607,This is the power of Doge.. It doesn't need paid endorsement from anybody but it just gets ppl talking about it.
4608,Sometimes you sound stoned.
4609,Buy doge now!
4610,"The lame encyclopedia computationally level because calendar utrastructurally frighten times a wasteful sousaphone. tiresome, six tuna"

4613,TO THE MOON BABY
4614,I didn’t realize this but he has a lisp

4632,The triple disclaimer was fun to watch.
4633,Only Ethereum Killer is Ethereum 2.0. Definitely not TRON lol. Expected nothing less from Justin Sun.
4634,CARDANO is the Future of cryptocurrency  🔥💯😍
4635,So you saying I should remortgage my house and sell my car and get more Doge? Got it!
4636,Was there a dentist appointment prior to this or has he always had a slight lisp and I’m just noticing it?
4637,Aight but when Dogecoin adds privacy features I’ll be interested. For now I’m sticking with Monero
4638,I thought it was pronounced dog-ecoin
4639,Marques probably bought at 8 cents and now he's worried because the bubble popped and he's trying to pump it again with this video lmao... Don't play with fire if you don't want to get burnt buddy.
4640,"brother, i should hold or sell?"
4641,pretty good video :D

4655,"That ending message cut through the bones. Gosh, I love MKBHD, legend in the making."
4656,Justin Sun from Tron is a joke. Stay away from Tron. I rather buy Doge.
4657,6:26 - Classic.
4658,MKBHD coming to save DOGE <3
4659,I made like $6000 off doge but now the hype has died down so I cashed out. I left a lil in there though.
4660,lmfao Tron is THE scam coin of 2017
4661,Cheers for continuity..i just hope it wasn't intentional.. 😂😂
4662,Marques hyping dog coins?
4663,intro scared the f out of me
4664,"Him: it's a person
Him(takes off his sweatshirt): it's him
Us: It's a whole new person"
4665,"Yeah no, Doge is so easy to make so it will just inflate extremely causing price to die down equally fast. It won't reach a dollar, get out while you made some cash."
4666,I am going to buy the dip.
4667,Can you tweet about my crypto coin I will pay you with my coin
4668,I get a dejavu bc of this video
4669,Respect for showing the Emails
4670,"so is this a ""smarter"" dogecoin ad?"
4671,Lol the funny part is that I made more money from thousands of Dogecoin in 2  months than a year of holding Bitcoin fractions where the value of one btc surged by nearly 40k.
4672,So whats a meme guys?
4673,My dream would be having DogeCoin surpass Bitcoin
4674,"thank you for your financial advice, put in $10k"
4675,Buy Doge
4676,To the moon 🚀🚀🚀
4677,He have more viwes in half time than dax new music and it is not on trending
4678,Dogecoin to the moon!
4679,"WTH did this video come from (too much doge news) LOLL
Doge has staying power in the crypto space but it will not be the world currency.

I'm glad you called out Tron.

I also feel that's how Trump won too"
4680,DOGECOIN IS KING!
4681,Great knowledgeable video
4682,Try as I might I cannot wrap my brain around cryptocurrency. How is it tangible? I'm so green. LOL
4683,Of course. On the base that we can get the price of the electrical bill. Out of it
4684,MKBHD AND TWITTER 😂
4685,"1337 dislikes, can't be mad"
4686,Justin Sun is a scammer!!!
4687,"Good one. I think for most companies, the volatility of BitC0in is a deterrent to getting on board in a s!gnificant way. Most compan!es manage their liquid asset very carefully. I know of some that will buy insurance to protect against currency variations. So, to get any part of their cash into ฿₮₵ might be too risky for them. The technology is great. And as it stabilizes, I think more will get on board. But for now, few will be in a position to appreciate those huge swings.. I would say ƚradıภg has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 8฿₮₵ in just few weeks, with the ƚradıภg stra:tegy provided by expert Graeme who runs someprograms for whoever lacks understanding on how ƚradıภg BitC0in works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypt0 mar:ket and also stack up more bitcoin.

4689,"Bitcoin’s price action has been somewhat stagnant throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin’s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months.i believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead.

4690,I think Marques forgot to tell that this video is not financial advice
4691,Nice PC but Kenya it rain Crysis?
4692,Mkbhd talking about graham that should lead to a great collab 😍✌🏼
4693,Imagine if tipping Youtubers with Dogecoin became a thing...
4694,Riding it to the moon m8!
4695,Ha ha ha...
4696,Hey how can I buy dogecoin I would love to invest
4697,"He finally did it !!! I'm looking forward to see more videos like this about Cryptos and the blockchain potential in general, also why it could completely change our future. If anyone knows how to explain and simplify everything in a concise manner it's  MKBHD."

Dogecoin stonks: _/"
4700,Elon is desperately in need of money... He buys stocks at dirt cheap and comments on it. There serious problems in Tesla/ spacex
4701,👏👏
4702,"I  mined and got my first Dogecoin on the 29/12/2013  I never ever thought it would reach the price it has reached today. BTW liked your  explanation of Doge, and why are people now calling it ""DOGE""  coin and not ""DOGIE""  coin as it is based on a dog meme Only ever first started hearing people calling it doge  instead of ""dogie"" in the last few months"
4703,So elon probably put lots of money in doge and can boost it significantly any time he wants with a tweet? This man is an evil mastermind
4704,"I am confused, someone told me it's self devaluing because it has no market cap"
4705,"They should create a RickCoin, coz that meme has just never died!"
4706,Can we get a studio tour 2021? I have to see the new studio and the gear
4707,Buying Doge sounds like a great use of an unexpected stimulus check ...

4716,Geeeez how many ads you got before I can see your video
4717,Marques thanks for calling out JSun :)
4718,I still have my 1500 Doge! if it hits $1 I will cash half of it and donate to a local shelter. Save the remainder until it hits $10 and do the same.
4719,The memelord....Elon
4720,Doge coin will reach 1 dollar if you have any clue how crypto works you should know dogecoin is a bit different from the rest as in theirs not a set amount and new coins are being made it only at a certain percentage and that percentage slows down every year eventually the supply will not be able to compare with demand and it’ll reach that dollar mark or beyond
4721,So when MKBHD COIN coming?
4722,HoDL - FoMo > FUD
4723,Another example: Trump as president
4724,Buy Doge!

4737,"please, which trade can someone go into without a lost?"
4738,"Ah yes, I remember the Jamaican bobsled team and the NASCAR car, good memories. Back when tipping around 1M+ doge at once was just...something you could do. A *little* bummed I didn't keep more of it, lol."
4739,Let's prove MKBHD wrong and make it go up to $1.00!!! Lol
4740,Dogecoin will rise.
4741,".08 was the equivalent of the joke presidency, the price dropped is equivalent to him resigning. Its over."

4762,Looks like you took Jimmy's suggestion (thumbnails) seriously😜
4763,why do you say meim
4764,after Elons tweet Dogecoin gains valuations... After MKBHDs complete explanation video it will sure going to BLAST...
4765,i dont really like crypto. but hey if doge is donating money on their earnings. im sold.
4766,horrible video
4767,Just put all my saving into Dogecoin. Thanks Marques!

4774,Introducing the MKBHD Matte Black Coin?
4775,I never knew I needed an ultimate frisbee player describe dogecoin to me but here I am
4776,Amazing. The dude can turn to his left to give a legal disclaimer and magically lose his hoodie. He's pure magic.
4777,Doge 🚀🚀🍾
4778,"DOGECOIN is same like famous JOKER meme ""WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY"" now its reality ❤🤩"
4779,I first mined Dogecoin back in 2014 and was one of the donators in that water fundraising campaign
4780,Tech video dogecoin
4781,Dog coin
4782,Elon should have bought physical silver instead of these cryptos. Can’t build electric cars or any smartphone or computer without physical silver.
4783,Happy to be following it since 2018. It used to never hold its value above 0.01 for longer than a day or a few hours. Now that it’s holding its value the future is a blank page. Anything can happen. Be excited.
4784,marquees check out Andrei jihk his way more understandable than Graham
4785,"Wait... Dude, did you just decimate Tron? 😆😆😆"
4786,Stellar Lumens is what I’ve been buying
4787,7:38 $25k or $30k?
4788,"Dude, respect. Great vid and honesty. Just shows the real piramid schemes under crypto currencies at the moment.  let's buy Tron so Lindsay Lohan and Ne-yo get some dollars hahaha"
4789,Bitcoin hit 50k today
4790,Marques is with us!
4791,Is odd how people take Elon musk's tweets as gospel yet don't think about why he's tweeting it in the first place
4792,Why does he need to say so many times that the video is not financial advising video. Doesn't people have common sense that you should be careful with your money?
4793,Damn the doge made it to MKBHD. Thanks Marques !
4794,Damn
4795,MKBHDcoin
4796,"Sure, TRX’s marketing is kind of cringe at times...However, Tron is a network that has WAY more utility than Doge. Doge is fun, but beyond that it serves no purpose. I would argue that if you wanted to get your feet wet in crypto, investing into Tron over Doge would be the safer bet. DYOR. (Not financial advice.)"
4797,Not having seen Cool Runnings is punishable by humiliation by not being able to answer the question: Are you dead man?
4798,much wow
4799,"Dogecoin = ""Doje"" Coin or ""Doggy"" Coin?"
4800,really? waste of a episode.
4801,I love how you brought up the tron currency to bag on them but it was actually an ad still
4802,Jamaican here I see that reference
4803,Finally decided to put money into Dogecoin nothing major if I lose it no big deal if it doubles I'll be able to get a hamburger
4804,"Just a quick correction. Will Rogers did run for president on a joke ticket, but he came no where close to winning. He ""declared victory and then resigned"" but, as we know from the past year, declaring victory doesn't mean anything. You have to have the votes, and Will Rogers did not have anywhere near enough votes to win."
4805,I like the part where he said he wasn't responsible for what happens after the video
4806,"People are hyping that coin up. I remember it from 2016 when most people were ignoring cryptos, I bought it for cheap."
4807,"The hungry step-uncle extraorally remember because holiday postmeiotically decay athwart a knowledgeable syria. bashful, ill-informed restaurant"
4808,Hey MKBHD creat a Waveform Coin
4809,So you bought some doge
4810,Shots fired!!!!
4811,I’m in the DOGE Coin army. :)
4812,I now totally 100% fully for sure absolutely kinda understand crypto
4813,The 1928 election thing you said is not enough remotely true. Like none of what you said is even true.
4814,"I don't think Elon is holding any, he probably knows it has no real value like other coins. He's most likely just buying millions of dollars worth, tweeting about it, then immediately selling it when it's value peaks.

Rinse and repeat, easy money without technically breaking any laws, despite having insane amounts of influence lol. He is a billionaire genius though, what do you expect."
4815,That unnecessarily loud 'ding' at the end lmfaoooo
4816,BUY AND HODL! TO THE MOON!
4817,"If you're in the comments looking for this, no, Will Rogers did not win the 1928 election. He said he'd resign if he did win but, of course, he didn't come close to winning."
4818,at 6:28 paying off celebs for tweets... didn't Greta Thunberg and Rhianna just get popped for this... yep
4819,Cardano is where it’s at
4820,Nice to see YT literally gave me no indication of your past two uploads!
4821,"It’s called a pump and dump, inside secret: we sell doge to noobs to use profit for real tokens. We been doing this for years."
4822,Musk is 100% pumping and dumping Dodgecoin
4823,"so I 100% thought it was pronounced like ""dogge"" or ""dogue"" or something and not like ""doje""? im very thrown off by this"
4824,"You forgot to mention that Dodgecoin has 128 billion coin supply circulating, which makes this coin almost impossible to move higher."

4836,Elon said he was joking about dogecoin.
4837,The best part of the video is when you called out those fakers who are already rich but want to squeeze every cent (or Dogecoin) out of their Twitter followers in an underhanded marketing ploy that is not stated to be sponsored.  Thank you for that!
4838,DOJE COIN!?

4843,There are over 5500 alt coins.
4844,"This is such an irresponsible video. Insinuating people should buy doge to learn and then “take those winnings” and invest elsewhere is insanity. You also hate on how tron does promo and then laugh at the fact Elon single handedly can bump price and volume in the same sentence. I never comment, and love your videos but your viewers didn’t need this take. You know how people are and Saying “not investment advice” is for you, now the viewers."
4845,Not many people talkong about Litecoin. Which went from 130 to 212 in a month.

4869,I wish you also mentioned what makes dogecoin a memecoin. It doesn't have a hard cap thus forever printing dogecoin. The memecoin is inflation

4882,"As a software engineer with almost a decade of experience in the cryptocurrency space, there is something everyone seems to forget when talking about Dogecoin.
Unlike Bitcoin, where the coin supply is limited (there would never be more than 21 million Bitcoins), Dogecoin doesn't have a cap limit. There are currently 128 billion Dogecoin in circulation with 5 billion new coins being added every year. 
Now, I'm not saying that in our insane world, where GME can become the biggest financial story, Dogecoin can't become the ""next big thing"", weirder things happened. 
But it is important to mention the difference between limited and unlimited supply currencies."

4912,So do I invest or not ?
4913,Wonder if Elon Musk pumps and dumps dogecoin given how he can basically manipulate the price at will.
4914,"Not as if anyone cares what I has to say but FFS DO NOT BUY DOGE! YOU WILL WITH A 80% CHANCE LOSE MONEY! As someone that has been into ""crypto"" since 2013 I've learned that Bitcoin oly matters. I wouldn't even recommend people to save their har earned money in that right now, since it also could blow up in their face with currently all FOMO, just save it in your fiat then when a correction of 30% or even a crash with 70%  has happened you start saving weekly in it."
4915,Dogecoin is a pump and dump driven by Elon’s cult following. 50% of all coins are controlled by a handful of wallets

It’s sad to see MKBHD join the false idea that It’s a harmless meme coin. Maybe it was at one point but with Musk as shitcoin pumper in chief, many will risk it all on this coin and get wrecked. Yes yes personal responsibility blah blah. Do yourself a favor and buy the proven store of value: bitcoin. It is hard capped at 21 million (unlike Doge) and its market cap is big enough now that it is not going away. There’s a reason that Tesla bought 1.5 billion in bitcoin and not Doge, something MKBHD also failed to mention. ✌🏻"

They're usually the same style wordpress templates with an animated node pattern in the header background, animated transitions of all the sections and general bad marketing taste. It's 95% of them.

I actually looked at 2000 crypto sites manually last year and rated them, only a small percentage got more than 8/10. Most got 0-3/10. 

Of course that ranking is about only those ""serious"" coins, not Doge - I love the joke idea behing it :)"

4951,DYOR Marques on Doge . Top wallets own 50% the supply.  They will dump on all the holders. This coin is plagued by large holders. They got it virtually free. Even Elon Musk thinks its a problem. People are just following the crowds. Dont ever follow the crowd.
4952,I love it my bro keep up the work and I love the video 💯
4953,Man he gets that hoodie off fast 🤣
4954,What app is at 2:02?
4955,So what I'm taking from this is Dogecoin is a joke. And because it's a joke it will succeed so is there a chance that it can reach a dollar is there a chance that can reach $10 yes. It may very well be a short-lived joke but guess what at least we can profit off of this joke. I don't plan to be a part of Dogecoin for there a long time just enough time to where I can set myself up LOL and be somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle

4991,"One of the biggest reasons why Dogecoin can't reach bitcoin valuation per coin or more is the market supply/ quantity. While bitcoin has about 2 million coins in the market, Dogecoin has over 100 billion coins. With the current world market at 90 trillion, even if Dogecoin dominates the market you will still have to divide the 90 trillion, entire world market, by over 100 billion coins outstanding. This gives you $900 as a theoretical maximum for Dogecoin 🐕."

5012,"Man, the attention to the little details makes me appreciate his videos even more. Like Marques looking to his left @ 0:46 and then to his right @ 0:58, might seem small but i liked that"
5013,"Okay since it's pretty obvious literally nobody knows what Dogecoin really is, let me explain.
Dogecoin has and always will be a hedge or more of a ""safe coin"" for big traders against larger cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, LTC, etc etc.. why? Because it has a floor and a roof. It's 1. Heavily manipulated by the big boys that has been buying it as a hedge for YEARS, and more importantly 2. It has an unlimited supply which helps them keep it more stable, what do I mean with unlimited supply? The Dogecoin creator made it so it prints more Dogecoins every single day, non-stop. This in turn means that price will naturally suppress itself because there has to be enough buyers DAILY to buy up the new supply of Dogecoins, if there's no daily buyers then price will automatically become weaker... it's that simple.

The ONLY reason it has pumped is obviously because of Elon Musk, so will he keep tweeting about it at least once weekly to make it spike up just to then gradually watch it decline because that's what it's made for? No, he will forget about it soon enough and it will go back down to its natural spot of ~8-30 sats because that's where the big boys will use their bots to buy the daily supply and keep it stable, just so they can use it later on to transfer funds away from larger cryptos.
I honestly think it's sad that such smart people have no fucking clue what Dogecoin actually is but endorses it to their millions of followers. Just remember what I said in a couple of months from now, you'll see."
5014,Its kinda scary how much elon musk can control the world just through tweets

And this can go for a while, but eventually it must come to an end where everyone in it would have lost their money. This is where your profit today comes from. I really think trading and gambling should be illegal as I don't see any beneficial role in the world from those activities. They only make some people rich and a lot of people poor. Everyone invests in crypto not because they believe this is the future, but they hope they can get richer by simply putting their money there. I don't think they care of consequences and are much more interested in getting on top of the game. There is nothing wrong in digital currency and that will be the actual future, hopefully we will quickly start using one single currency and stop paying for conversions and trading and worrying about money going to the moon or disappearing in a bottomless pit."
5087,where did you get that white adidas hoodie!!? :)
5088,And now dogecoin skyrockets with MKBHDs video.
5089,"I worry about any crypto currency, I like real stuff because if there was a Carrington event (Solar storm)  then this stuff is vapourware same as stocks and shares gold will still retain it's value as will real money if you can get it out of the wall/bank. These products are also not very good for the environment as it takes a lot of wasted energy to create one."

5103,My mom's gifting me doge for my birthday
5104,Isn't it dogycoin?
5105,Weird how you didn't mention that Dogecoin cannot ever reach Bitcoin so people don't get their hopes up and invest crazy amounts on a meme coin. Nice disclaimer at the end though lol.
5106,Worst explanation of Alt Coins
5107,Marques gonna get into crypto universe
5108,"First one was the bitcoin 
And another dogecoin"
5109,Who is best bitcoin or dogecoin...?
5110,Dogecoin is the cutest coin... that should worth something!
5111,"Mobiepay - MBX, look it up, this is a gem"

5122,Why he pronounce it wrong
5123,"""Do-Ge coin"""
5124,"i like the Cool Runnings shoutout, and yes, you should go watch it"
5125,I love how you take your jacket off when giving the serious advice
5126,Tron is shady as fuck
5127,Elon buys Doge and promotes it to buy more Bitcoin. Not mad at it.
5128,In that case everyone holds Bitcoin for research purposes. Every big gun is silently stacking up bitcoin.
5129,We are going to the moon baby! 🚀🌙
5130,CCIV
5131,Are you wearing braces?
5132,"🤔 tell me more about this ""pump and dump"" you speak of. Sounds like a fun time 🐶🌝🚀"
5133,What I've taken away from this video? Marques told me to put my life savings into Dogecoin. He is solely responsible for me making this decision.
5134,why always s21 ad appear
5135,"Cryptocurrencies in general cannot be overlooked, and their usecases are endless, hence the main reason institutions are getting into it.
Also, nothing that the growth of bitcoin and ethereum has been significant over the past few years.
The market is still fresh and relatively new compared to other markets that have been in existence over the past decades or centuries hence the need to hold more now.
Holding more at this stage is very important, and one of those ways to do it is by trading.
You don't wake up and start trading, instead, you seek the assistance of a professional who has an in-depth insight on how the market works.
I was lucky enough to meet a pro named Nyberg through one of his early days podcast on the need to hold cryptocurrency as that will revolutionize the way we see things and spend money in the future.
Nyberg guides me on how to trade, and now I hold more bitcoin, and I have also learned much from him.
The challenges ahead are endless and hence the need for everyone to take the opportunity now that it is still early, and you can do that by reaching out to Nyberg to guide you through.
He will guide you on how to get started effectively, and you can get through to Nyberg on Tele-gram (nyberghan), and Whats-App (+44-742-722-9815)."
5136,i am going to get me some dogecoin could be the next bitcoin yuh know a lot of money🤑
5137,this is literally: my thoughts video than explained. Waste of time
5138,You clicked the links from an unknown source? You clicked the links?! YOU. CLICKED. THE. LINKS?!?!?!
5139,damn how did he get that jacket on and off so quick?
5140,"it was a Pump and Dump, stop making video about stuff you have no idea about 
the top 100 Doge wallets were DUMPING MASSIVE AMOUNTS of doge on idiots"
5141,"You forgot to mention that Dogecoin is too easy to mine and will continue to inflate indefinitely. Which means even if all transactions are going to be in Dogecoin at some point, it will never be a good long term investment. When the price goes up, more people mine it and the price will slowly go back down again.
Other coins get more difficult to mine over time, which is why they might be able to hold their value long term, but not Dogecoin.
Use it for small transactions, but never keep any significant amount of your net worth in it."
5142,lmao ‘That is pretty cringe behaviour’ -MKBHD 2021 I love it.
5143,where dog
5144,"Internet: ""If memes were currency.""

Elon: ""hold my Doge"""
5145,That transition where the jacket disappears and reappears killed me 😂
5146,😍😍
5147,❤️❤️
5148,doge. a coin. the ultimate crossover.
5149,"Crypto currency are all about hype. The more influential people talk about it, the more value it will get from people buying it."
5150,Elon Musk is pulling a fast one on a lot of people. And they're going to be left upset when this is done.
5151,"Anyone unsure of who Tron are: look at how they performed a hostile takeover of Steem, censored everyone that called them out, FROZE USER FUNDS SO PEOPLE THAT SPOKE UP COULDN'T TRANSACT THEIR COINS, and caused the community to fork the entire blockchain to remove Justin Sun and Tron and be decentralised again."
5152,Have you got Invisalign in? I swear your voice sounds different on this video. Unless I am going crazy. 😜
5153,"Thank you for at least pronouncing it right.  So many arm-chair economists have been calling it ""dough-gie"" like doggie, and it is painful to the ears.

Also; missed opportunity.  Like the doge himself, this meme has got legs lol"
5154,Take a shot everytime you see a verified comment
5155,A wish to get s21ultra
5156,So many mindless gen z people are just dumping all their money into doge jusr cause elon tells them to 😂😂 no one thinks for themselves anymore
5157,Am I the only one who pronounced it 'Dog-e-coin'...
5158,It’s the doge! From the meme. Of course he’s pronouncing it correctly.
5159,"doge is a shitcoin, it's a funny shitcoin but still a shitcoin"
5160,HODL
5161,I don’t know what the official pronunciation is for dogecoin but I always thought the intention of the name was: (dog e-coin). Regardless fantastic video
5162,"Tron: We want to push a cryptocurrency. Who should we get for the promotional campaign?
Finacial Advisor: Well, remember that washed up Disney star who tried to kidnap a child whilst intoxicated? 
Tron: We're listening."
5163,"That's was some crazy 2010 Karate Kid act you pulled there, taking your jacket off and putting it back on in the space of a cut scene."
5164,There's something called Pi which also has a super shady push
5165,"Tron is another joke coin, but trying to look legit.  The last run up they spiked because they were used for Crypto-kittens."
5166,HCMC is the next big thing!
5167,I thought it was a meme
5168,"first of all great video. second, did u lose a tooth dude? no disrespect just curious"
5169,BUY AND HOLD. Who's with me?
5170,"dogecoin has an unlimited number of mineable coins, it’ll only go down in value in the big picture of time. If you’re in the green for profit, sell now, or face the consequences."
5171,It‘s not doj coin
5172,I saw jake paul's tweet about tron too.
5173,"Here's my thing though... eventually memes die out. The dogecoin isn't rare. It's an unlimited supply, which like the US dollar, can be extremely inflatable. Bitcoin and other alt coins are not. There will never be a unlimited supply of BTC. So that right there puts doge as valuable as paper... To me anyway. I wouldn't put more than $5 on it."
5174,mkbhd was paid by doge coin
5175,You had to record this with 2 cameras just to say this wasn’t a financial advice
5176,Dogecoin is objectively the best currency
5177,MKBHD IS A CYTRO BUYER LOL
5178,What the heck
5179,"Pro tip: don’t get your crypto education from MKBHD. It’s a good deconstruction of a meme, not a good explanation of cryptos and “altcoins”. (Tron is still shit)"
5180,"Well, welcome to the crypto community I guess. Now the whole world knows crypto."
5181,"8:40 Yea, it's called market manipulation and it's illegal"
5182,"Dogecoin is just a meme, it’s not a serious thing, there is no market cap or finite number of them, they can continually be mined forever, therefore making it worthless, it’s only going up in value because of idiots spreading hype. 

It’s like a bunch of people picking leaves off trees and trying to sell them to each other. Anyone who has invested serious money in it, and are within profit margins, I would HIGHLY advise you selling it right now, don’t be the one holding the bag when it crashes down to .001 penny again..."
5183,Imagine if MKBHD and Daddy Elon both started tweeting about DOGE
5184,The sidenote shot should not be lost. It's awesome and very intuitive for the viewer
5185,who let the doge out?
5186,Ive been trying to buy doge since it was at 2.5 cents. I tried to deposit to robinhood and its STILL pending. Its great lol

5204,"The thirsty traffic inferiorly practise because banker adversely excite per a teeny-tiny waste. absorbing, abrasive underwear"

5206,"If one of the biggest Youtubers suddenly starts talking about crypto and picks Doge of all coins, you know it's time to sell."
5207,plot twist: Marques is actually sponsored by Dogecoin
5208,Sidebarring so hard his hoodie vanishes
5209,"I’ve never had any interest in holding cryptocurrencies in my investment portfolio but I do like how the makers of Dogecoin give some of the money to charity, that might just be a good reason to buy some Dogecoin"
5210,MattBlack coin TO THE MOON
5211,"Literally 99% of people ignore this message: ""God save you and your family from all sickness 🙏"
5212,"MKBHD talking about crypto. All the institutional interest would not advocate for the market better than you, man. And you are *NOT* a financial adviser ;) Expect a pump in the all the altcoins and bitcoin pretty soon."
5213,"Elon Musk: farts
MKBHD: FARTS EXPLAINED"
5214,I’m so happy Bitcoin and those dead alt coins will never be a real currency used by people. I just don’t like the idea of them because the internet is taking over WAAAAY to much now
5215,Doggycoin
5216,Who else still holding
5217,Marques do you have any videos on how your daily routine? what you do for your mind and body to stay focused/good health etc?
5218,Tron stonks stinks after this
5219,"Will Rogers did NOT win the election. He just declared he did as a joke. Don't you think if something that absurd happened we would've all heard about it by now? The scary bit is I always thought of MKBHD as a pretty 'thorough' guy, so him not doing his research on something like this is very odd."
5220,Throw a couple of rockets on there and you got yourself a god thumbnail for this topic lol 🚀 🚀 🚀
5221,Anyone can make an altcoin... Ok who's gonna make the Mattecoin?
5222,"Love the fact that you completely expose  Tron’s shady dealings. But Dogecoin isn’t about the meme anymore since this whole bull market started. It’s all about irrational price predictions and trying to get rich on a coin that doesn’t have a fixed supply, already has 128 BILLION coins in circulation and creates 10’000 new coins with each mined block."
5223,"Bitcoin is a great store of value, that's why so many people invest in it. It is barely able to be a real global currency, because it is like Elon Musk said ""deflationary to a fault"". Dogecoin on the other hand has a real possibility of becoming a real currency, there is always the 10000 Dogecoins that get mined every minute and this will be forever. So you have inflation but the inflation rate is reduced over time so dogecoin gains almost a deflationary character. You basically have a perfect currency that embodies the benefits of bitcoin (the anti thesis to Fiat money) and Fiat money."
5224,So you are obviously promoting doge coin and you are obviously ignorant of the altcoin scene. You are doing exactly what those people did for TRON in a disguised manner who is fooling no one yet influences the masses...people are loosing money on this man. This is not a joke.
5225,tron is a shitcoin

5229,"Dogecoin is doomed to fail (By design) There is no cap on the amount of doge, it mines an insane amount of new doge every minute. It's the biggest inflation coin there is."
5230,why not talk about THETA token  ?

5255,What spezific jacket is this? :)
5256,Ah yes Meme coins economy in finest
5257,"One thing to do if you delve in the cryptocurrency sphere. Is to avoid any coin that is heavily marketed. If everyone is talking  positively ans embellishing a coin that is definitely a scam or at least that coin is already overpriced, you are getting in too late. As for now the bullrun is going and you see a two digits gains every fucking day except Sundays. I don't know why it dips in Sundays ?"
5258,MKBHD's long awaited 👏👏 Meme Review 👏👏
5259,Why don’t you be honest with people and show them the facts that there is an unlimited supply and that it is a horrible investment and most importantly you will lose a lot of money
5260,You put a bunch of money in Doge didn't you.  Gotta be shillin for gains now.
5261,Guess I should watch this as I just hastily invested for the meme basically lol
5262,Go dogecoin
5263,More videos like this. Yes.
5264,"Neither of the Altcoins supposed to be better than the Bitcoin. They just have different Purposes. Some of them are rlly promising like Polkadot, Cardano, Theta etc. And they will never replace Ether or Bitcoin. Just different Purposes my man"
5265,"Okay guys, let me explain to you why dogecoin is NOT and will NEVER be a good long term investment, regardless of it's temporary popularity. Dogecoin has an infinite supply, which means that new coins will keep coming into existence, lowering the value of every coin (just like fiat money). Bitcoin and many other altcoins have a finite supply. Bitcoin for example, currently has around 18.5 million coins in existence and every 4 years the supply of new coins is halved until 21 million coins exist. This means that bitcoin will always keep rising in value with increasing demand. Dogecoin is only good for temporary trading."

Graham was misleading in how he told the story and his disingenuous delivery of this story has now been spread to millions of people all who have taken it at face value. This is a great example of seeing how quickly false information can spread. To be clear Will Rogers had a fake campaign, but never registered as a politician, and declared himself winner in 1928, but solely as a comedian and political pundit. It's so disappointing to see this false information spread transpire in real time."

First of all, Graham Stephan is a fake Guru who pretends to be a successful millionaire but his actual stream of money is through selling courses. 
Also referring to the Dogecoin as an ""investment"" is completely unethical; unless playing in a casino is called ""investing"" today.
Many people trust you and may lose a lot of money after this reckless video."

5446,Thank you for the tips. I just invested all my savings to doge. Got now 4200 doges. To the mono!
5447,"ADA to the moon and beyond, SOON!!!!! ;)"
5448,"Cypto-coins are zero-sum Ponzi/pyramid get-rick-quick pump-and-dump schemes. The only reason they go up is because the next fool is willing to pay more for it that than the previous fool (look up Greater Fool Theory). The total sum of all money to buy crypto-coins minus what money gets out of it by selling is below zero, because there are also transaction costs. The total net worth expressed in non-crypto money of the entire group of people that will ever own a particular coin will decrease, never increase. It is a redistribution of wealth. A few will get very rich, most will loose money. Unlike stocks, there is no intrinsic value, and no value is created, only a tremendous amount of electrical energy is wasted. If you buy all stocks of a company you own all assets of that company, if you were to buy all coins of a particular crypto-currency, you will have something that is worth nothing. They barely have any usefulness as currency or even as distributed ledger, they are just a gambling/speculation devices. Their prices are very easy to manipulate the price, someone that has al lot of them (the so called ""whales"") can sell a whole lot of them, the price will drop, they can buy it back cheaper.

Elon Musk is always complaining about the short traders, but yet he backs crypto-currency, it makes absolutely no sense to me.."
5449,Just shows how powerful the internet is. We could decide together to take a meme and make it become a legit success story. It feels good to hype up dogecion as the average citizen to feel like we have control over some of this mysterious economy.
5450,Why does it sound like Marques has a lisp all of a sudden??
5451,DOGECOIN IS THE FUTURE !
5452,We need an MKoinBHD Crypto 🤔

5456,"Marques
make altcoin with the help of youtube content creators for the people...back it yourselves and make it trustworthy unlike big old financial companies...this will be a new era for many people as well...you may use it for good causes like planttree or help people who has faced flood in some part of the world or etc...."
5457,🚀
5458,It's harmless until you lose 20% XD
5459,"Thanks for calling out TRON, they've been bad actors in the ecosystem since before they launched, plagiarizing code and work from other projects, promoting themselves to people who don't know better, fabricating activity and statistics, and basically erasing the work of honest people in the rest of the industry."
5460,I call it doggycoin.
5461,I just hold Bitcoin
5462,I liked the Warning ⚠ of MKBHD about investments...
5463,alright who keen to blow doge coin up?????
5464,Thanks for the financial advice
5465,We need a MKBHDcoin
5466,Still no development on Doge it has always been a pump an dump coin. This might change but to prevent the dump someone will have to start develop it without the development there will be a dump at some time. The entire crypto will dump but doge will be one of the worst dumps unless there starts to be an actual use case for it where development starts on Doge.
5467,MKBHD: That's kind of tech video🤔🤔
5468,Before you watch the video. Buy bois and girls and hold that bih 😂we need to eat this year
5469,"Thanks Marquees.

5471,This is the worst video you have ever done.  Promoting a broken crapcoin or giving it any sort of publicity is a terrible idea.
5472,Dollar and Dogecoin share the same letter. It's not coincidental. The latter will replace the former!

5488,wait? we have a water crisis? i didn't know this and I live here
5489,Should I buy like €10 worth
5490,Future currency of SPACE!
5491,TRON is officially  R.I.P😅😂
5492,DOGE - the meme coin created as a joke with an infinite market cap.But still there are so many people out there thinking they get rich quick while the pump (increase was around 1500%) is already long gone and now they hodl their bags on the losing side.
5493,"US 2016 elections was between Tron and Dogecoin, Dogecoin won the elections and the following 4 years the news was all memes."
5494,"BFCH ...IF you missed riot and mara 8 months ago when they were trading under a dollar. we now have the next riot and mara and its only 0.25 cents its BFCH. if you dont know the blockchain stocks companies is were its at these days. if BFCH dont reach atleast $100 dollars a share by the end of this year call me ill give you the difference. the reason its cheap is because its brand new but its a huge company. its a stock not a crypto so you would have to buy it from a stock broker like etrade, lightspeed, robinhood or other stock brokers. and since its a new company you cant buy it pre or after market you can only buy it during market hours as a limit order."
5495,What webcam is that in the background?
5496,"It's not going to break a dollar. There's a huge market cap already and there's no limit to who many coins to exist. In addition, if people don't sell nothing is going to happen. Especially the whales."
5497,maybe mr beast is going to buy a million dogecoins and then give them all away to strangers and the strangers will be richer than mr beast
5498,The fanboy of elon musk returns *sigh*
5499,this was nothing more than click bait. i almost didn't watch it.
5500,Is it Dowj coin or DOG E coin?
5501,"I’ve been selling Nutella (remember when that was a meme too?) exclusively for Dogecoin since 2014. 

Glad to see the world finally catching on!!"
5502,MKHB been buying Dogecoin since 2018 before Elon Musk. The fact that you one of my favorite tech channels is covering Dogecoin a crypto currency is only more proof Dogecoin is here to stay. See you in 5 years when I'm filthy rich. Dogecoin to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀
5503,"i hope someday we would also have dickcoin, the whole world has become a joke, hhakkkkhhhhhhhhh"
5504,5:01 Either I'm super confused or MKBHD is 😂. Will Rogers didn't win the presidential election 1928... He just declare that he won - as a joke! 😂
5505,"MKBHD my man. Love your content but Will Rogers didn't 'win and then resign.' He ran for president, declared himself the winner with only a tiny % of the vote and then resigned. Just a friendly fact-check :)"
5506,Oofcoin
5507,"people thaat bought AMC and GME will buy this. its a joke coin. Sure, money to be made but not an investment ,"
5508,"If doge fails you'll basically have to tell people that you lost all your money buying, invisible magic internet money, that a guy on the internet told me to buy. Get a little Cardano and Polkadot to hedge that bet."
5509,"buy doge before it's late, last chance"
5510,"And yet you have to buy these bogus ""Coins"" with hard currency that actually holds value... And you say it yourself.. Is easy to make... Can you get hard currency out of your bitcoins? The issue is they can just make more and more... If you do that as a country.. the you will loose the value... Thats why a piece og bread in germany was something 12.000.000 deutchmark..."

5516,MKBHDcoin
5517,"Not disclosing an ad is not just cringe behavior, it's straight-up illegal (6:41)"
5518,"I think you could have done a little more reading and done your followers a better service.  Maybe spoken more about how the only thing moving the price up is speculation.   About how the original creators are very minimally involved and kind of ashamed at what it has become and why they feel that way, more about what dogecoin is from the inside out ...and not the outside in.  You made it seem almost harmless investment and even philanthropic.  I was waiting for you to at least say its basically bitcoin with a dog face meme....but not even that.   Oversimplified video that will just add gas to this false flame.  Im being hard on you mainly because you seem smart and im sure you could have done better. lastly, dear YouTube.....if a person has to say "" this isnt financial advice""  more than once.....they are in some way giving you financial advice but dont want the accountability.People that will not assume accountability are not the ones you want to guide important decisions in your life.... ok, i will go back to my front porch and make sure you crazy kids dont step on my lawn.  Cool logo though."
5519,That’s exactly what I told my friend today. Wow 😯
5520,can i get some change for this Doge bro?
5521,"So technically, Doge is the most ""expensive"" meme out there. 7 billion dollars in market cap as of right now. That's.... A lot of money."

5526,WHO LET THE DOGE OUT???
5527,All these coin nonsense will come crushing down like every other pyramid schemes.
5528,Doge to Mars 🚀
5529,Thanks for this video
5530,From tech to crypto. 😎
5531,Your so last year
5532,can you share the link to dogecoin
5533,The fact that YouTube is talking about this token is hilarious. I have been in crypto from the start of it and I remember when this was put out to the world as a meme. It has taken a life of its own and this is pretty funny it’s making waves like this.
5534,Xrp community! Where you at?
5535,Tron is a scammmm
5536,"This video might be a real life experiment, Marques testing whether he can now influence crypto currencies, like Elon does.."

5549,Great video!
5550,"Dollar ? You can be lucky if you hit 0,10. Still unlikely. It’s a meme"
5551,Time to short trx.
5552,What is it backed by?
5553,"Fun fact:- Most of the ""Fun Fact's"" are not funny(Including my comment)"
5554,"I'm just thinking if Doge really catches up, we will have DOGE face on our currency instead of Washingtons and Gandhis."
5555,6:38 just shows you how fake the celeb world is. People look up to celebrities like gods and listen to everything they say - when the reality is they just say shit they have no idea what they’re talking about so they can make more money. Always better to do your own research.
5556,All you need is Chainlink. Thank me next year
5557,Think about it.........it’s money or Bitcoin that going to be acceptable to spend! All the other coins will not be use for any payment at all.

5561,Why does the audio feel overly compressed in this video?
5562,"That makes sense to have a video about crypto from you, it's also tech after all !!!
I'm not a trader or a serious investor, just buy a few bucks of project I believe in, started in 2017 with Ethereum or a few month ago with Cardano!"
5563,"You all shouldn't be listening to people like Elon musk who are trying and succeeding in manipulating people with just a tweet and his rich public face, people are dumb they don't give a fuck about a person when he is poor and starting worshiping the same person when he gets rich.. think of it all these years nobody gave a fuck about what he says some smart people still don't, but now when people are actually listening to him believing he is the richest guy in the world he is manipulating and trying to ruin people's lives. You cant misguide people with their hard-earned money you cant joke with people's lives.. He must be stopped!"
5564,This video has no conclusion.
5565,Even for a meme is better currency than Fiat...
5566,Just buy HCMC!!! Its going to the moon!
5567,this video is actually an ads for dogecoin

5577,Lisp?
5578,This Will Rogers point is just totally wrong. He did not even have ballot access in most states and just declared himself the winner. The election was actually one by Herbert Hoover in a landslide. This is literally one Google away
5579,LOVE YOU <3
5580,I think this Elon fanboy bought a huge amount of Dogecoin and then realised it was going nowhere. So now he's trying to boost up the price a little bit so he can sell for some profit (something like that). Thumbs down for the video 👎
5581,Lol you trying to explain BTC and alts gave me a good laugh. Don't quit your day job Marques. We love ya.

5594,DOGECOIN WILL HIT $2 by end of 2022
5595,Please hide the cable that runs down the bacl of your middle monitor!!
5596,"Nice review but Why encourage DogeCoin over other currencies ? 
Is it better in some way ?
Waisting power and hardware that could be put to better use even if it is just to enjoy a good game seems like a waste !
Why not boost a better option like Forest Coin Earth where you Get Forestcoin Cryptocurrency by:
-Planting a tree
-Approving trees other have planted
-Buying at crypto exchanges
If you join use my code FC329 😜"

5612,Doing something as a joke and becoming successful reminds me of my friend vicky. Back in 6th grade Vicky ran for sixth grade president. And it was really cool because she won by not trying and just being whatever about it. I remember all the serious class president type of kids getting all upset. I still laugh at them now.
5613,Haha nice

5647,"I do not understand the value of any cryptocurrencies that can be created at will.
Right, the maintenance of one cryptocurrency costs energy and a lot of it. Does that makes it a store of value?
To be honest, I shall say that I do not understand either, the value of fiat moneys like the dollar that is backed by nothing but faith.
What we see in the fiat currency realm, is their infinite creation by the central banks who buy as many debt and assets as possible in order to prevent the overextended financial system from crumbling on its own footprint.
The debasement of fiat is nothing but certain in these uncharted times.
Does the fiat currency inflation makes the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies a safe haven? I don't know.
I'm old school and in these times, I rather store value in precious metal than in cryptocurrencies."

5695,what do you think about the pi network (stamford guys). that could be legit if they handle it properly?
5696,"Cryptocurrencies are fantasy speculation objects with no intrinsic value. If and when faith in them disappears, you will lose your shirt.

5736,Sped up the disclaimers to make them sound authentic.
5737,I appreciate you calling out shilling

5752,"Of course it will reach 1$. And even more. Dogecoin isn't something created last month and will still be around for the years and years to come. You could doubt this in 2016 because you may have thought that the  doge meme will die(which happened) and this will lead to the death of the coin based on this meme, but it didn't. It kept growing and growing not only the market cap and price but also the community. The price may stay where it's at drop during this year but after a few years it may rise again. Dogecoin is here to stay. It's not like a new version will come out and make this one obsolete"

Dont get me wrong, its one thing to fuel speculation and buy based on some future hope the speculation will drive its price up. But just realize the fundamentals of the coin are designed to lose value over time. There isnt a dedicated developer community for the coin and so the coin cannot properly handle a fork to change these protocols."

5843,Pi 👌

5873,Doge to the MOON!

5875,"People think, screaming DODGE TO THE MOON! will make the coin gain value... really?! Even Elon said it's a Joke."

5902,"Marques, its not 1st April yet."
5903,Monero is where its at
5904,I feel like it important to note that crytocurrency wastes immense amounts of energy. A single transaction can easly be the biggest part of energy used by a person in a MONTH!
5905,wow such coin
5906,Marques is down on Dogecoin.. Don't worry buddy you will live to see a profit lmao
5907,tron ..  the shittest shitcoin

5912,"I don't know about dogecoin specifically, but bitcoin uses a ton of electricity, more that the entire country of Argentina
Edit: youtube doesn't want me to post my sources"
5913,"I have a new, to me, approach to this whole Doge explanation when Doge fans try to convince me of it's magic. After realizing that there are four groups that I can describe, I was able to more rationalize the different thought's.
First, you have the people who are about wealth preservation. They understand the M2 money supply. They don't want to see the dollar earned today, worth less next year.
Then you have the lottery players. Their the one's looking for a quick buck. Have no idea what they're going to get, but the number on the billboard keep's getting bigger.
Third, you have a combination of the first two. The big difference is the way different things are treated within a portfolio. As with normal stocks, you would diversify your crypto portfolio with the strongest asset with the best long term perspective, as your majority holding.
Of course the fourth group would be the institutional traders, but for the over all comment, we won't include them.
Bottom line, figure out what your goal is and invest appropriately. Just be aware, that with higher percentage gains come higher risk's!"
5914,He talked about tron and there is tron as an ad here 😂😂😂
5915,I had invested 500 rupees (~7-8 Dollars) and now its value is 380 rupees :|

5918,"There are plenty of worthwhile Altcoins, making a difference now.
VET is revolutionizing logistics and IOT.
Theta is making streaming cheaper and faster.
XRP is making crossboarder payments cheaper, safer and faster.
VIDT is certifying documents, images and video.
Enjin is allowing for tipping gamers and making cheaper and faster games.
BAT is paying you to watch ads or get rid of them entirely.
And so many more..."
5919,The most cheeky MKBHD vid ever
5920,Marques needs to create Dopecoin or Bruhcoin

5925,Have you notice Marquez you started talking like Elon Musk now.
5926,oooo..... TRON being burned...

5929,"Jacket / No Jacket ... Jacket..

5946,"Bitcoin and the entire crypto market have been heavy as of late, with BTC and altcoins alike struggling to gain massive momentum due to the immense selling pressure that bears have been placing on the benchmark crypto. Where the market trends in the days and weeks ahead should depend largely on whether or not bulls can stop BTC from seeing any intense selloff resulting from the recent rejection at $39,000. One trader is now watching to see how BTC responds to $34,000, noting that this is a “line in the sand” that needs to hold for bulls to gain any control over its price action. One trader explained that $34,000 is the key level to watch in the short-term, as a daily close above or below this level could determine Bitcoin’s near-term fate. I have been a horrible tradr up until I saw Burwell Coleman program on trding crypto assets, prior to using his signals I wasn’t doing too great, although I had knowledge on the basics, it wasn’t just enough to kick it in. Burwell showed me how to beat the market, properly manage risk. Within the space of 4 weeks, I have been able to build a great trad!ng portfol\o, am sitting on a trad!ng portfol\o of about 9 btc. I must say, being guided by an expert seems to bridge the hindrance to understanding crypto trading, I would advise every newbie to seek the assistance of an expert before delving into trading any crypto asset.

5953,Tron is actually pretty decent tho
5954,"Bitcoin just can't serve every purpose that many of the altcoins can. A lot of them do not market themselves as ""a better Bitcoin"", but rather cryptos that specialize in something Bitcoin couldn't do efficiently if at all. I think MKBHD knows this but is just what's called a Bitcoin Maxi. If not, he should definitely do more research."
5955,Disclaimer this comment section is not financial advice
5956,What is the name of his podcast?
5957,1 doge = 1 doge 😀
5958,It's worth mentioning that the reason everybody is looking for the tiny new altcoin to invest in is because being one of the first investors is the only way anyone's going to make money with cryptocurrency because it's a damned ponzi scam and that's how they WORK.

In more important news, where did the sweater go in the cutaway shots‽"
6015,banks gonna go be irrelevant to store money if crypto becomes future. so maybe less job hiring i guess?

6029,MKBHD will make doge $1
6030,"Crypto currency is a joke. 
If you take away the word currency it might look legit. 

Currency is meant to be spent. A currency where you hold it long is not a currency anymore.  How would you spent money that you do not want to let go? 

Which is why calling it currency is a big joke.
It all started in a idea where it should replace fiat money. But then how would you replace it if nobody want to let go of it?"
6031,Make a crypto channel now
6032,I brought 7.00 worth.  If it takes off sweet if not I have 7 dollars in my ashtray

6036,"Please no one buy or promote Tron, it is terrible and will lose you money. 
Just like they did 3 years ago."
6037,"Bitcoin is sadly very inefficient.
You can only fit around 300k transactions in a block each hour,
Visa for example is handling MILLIONS of transactions in a minute.
You have to wait days for your transactions to be accepted.
Also it might easily happen that your transaction gets denied 3 DAYS after you sent it because it's in a shorter chain."
6038,"Dang, I look sharp on the coin"
6039,So should we invest in doge?
6040,What if Doge were the natural inhabitants of Mars and this is a financial invasion?
6041,The volume graph correlates directly with social media posts for all crypto currencies. That is why Tron would approach celebrities in order to force the value up because these currencies do not have anything else backing the value like gold used to for typical currencies.
6042,That dog. We call him cheems in memes
6043,I lost about $20k during the Doge Coin madness and I'm not regretting lmao
6044,Dogecoin
6045,Sad that a Cool Runnings reference has to be explained.
6046,Go sell is ture
6047,"don't forget that doge is inflationary, and the coin supply will only rise in the future, this mean a lower price in the long run, this is why is a joke of a coin because it has been made in order to not have value"

6059,Strap in we're going to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6060,20 years later ppl will be like: “remember the times when you could get 1 doge for a dollar?”
6061,“That is pretty cringe behaviour”
6062,Marques is continuing his legacy of exposing celebrities on Twitter... 🤣
6063,So retail investment has become marketable? Are we on our way to using more psychological analytics for market projections? How many influencers are going to start catching this wave? WTF is going on here!? I'm scared and excited...this generation might leave the Wall street dinos behind.
6064,Literally classic scam Justin Sun and TRON kek
6065,Do I hear a lisp?
6066,"Dogecoin = Marques, Altcoins = Digital Foundry.  Elon is not sitting in cigar-smoke filled room making decisions, he is the cigar-smoke in the room."
6067,"Dogecoin is centralized, Elon owns about 2 billion of those coins 😔"
6068,I just noticed that Marques has a lisp
6069,"With over 10k coins being mined per minute, and 5 billion per year I doubt it would be at 1$"

6076,The disclaimers😂😂
6077,Im already onboard the TRON train cuz of Lindsay Lohan..
6078,"i made $982 off of this ""JOKE"" 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE"
6079,"0:45 how did u change camera, remove your jacket, then change camera again and get your jacket back on?"
6080,"People should not forget that Doge is designed to be extremely inflationary.  
It is still sooo easy to mine that it cannot hold the value even if it gets some GME-level of push.  
In the end, the inflation will win.  

If you wanna get into crypto for 'investment', Doge is designed to be the stupidest choice in long term."
6081,"Hey, I thought all cryptocurrency are expensive gambling chips, but this one looks cheap enough to buy at least 1 coin. I always wonder to buy one before this become a huge gambling market so, I might actually buy one. I don’t know."

6086,"Man look at real projects like ETHEREUM.Dogecoin is gettin too much attention and is gonna be bad for investors in the future.
Is just a funny coin.Elon Musk like it because is a meme"
6087,"Just so everyone is aware: There are 10000 new Doge coins being created every minute. Bitcoin has a finite number of coins, which partly creates it's value. Dogecoin just keeps going brrrr"
6088,You're a smart dude. Elon can afford to make mistakes. But If I were you I would consult my attorney before talking about virtual currency. Any legal disclaimer you put up may not be sufficient to protect you across all states. People might take your review of the product as a financial advice endorsement. They might make a stupid financial decisions and potentially lose a lot of money. Guess what...?
6089,what if Doge paid Elon and Marques to act about it this way and give you the fake feeling of assureness?
6090,"No mention at all of the energy used for each transaction? ""A fun, harmless cryptocurrency""? I think this needs a follow-up"

6232,Another example of a product that didn't take itself seriously: google cardboard
6233,Anything that portrays money as a serious commodity is bound to fail. The fact is people don't take money seriously and so only a non- serious fun currency such as the Dogecoin will cut it in the market..

6242,I have no money to buy a food 🥝 or water 💦
6243,The fact this guy is explaining this just goes to show a bubble exists
6244,"Honestly, If you'r talking about DOGECOIN and thinking abt investing in DOGE"".  It means you didn't pass the ""INTELLIGENCE TEST"". Elon Musk"" didn't invest 1.5 billion in DOGE. You, Mr. Marques should stick to analysing apple products."
6245,Tron is a scam be aware of Justin Sun
6246,"absolutely stunning
we need learn more about cryptocurrency ! its future !!"
6247,"Damn! People are gonna get rekt (lose everything) if YouTubers don't provide their less informed followers more in-depth info about Doge. If you want to get some to experiment with crypto, that might make sense, but don't buy it as an investment.  The only usefulness of Doge is to use it as a stepping stone toward investing in Bitcoin, imo."

6259,"I'm a Corporate Law & Finance Master's student and have been doing market research for fun, the one thing I come across time and time again is investor/market perception. 
Majority people invest in stocks based on what they think is going to happen in the future, which is based on things like influence from celebrities, politicians, etc. instead of making decisions off of financial statements, audit reports, ongoing/upcoming lawsuits, AGMs/EGMs, press releases, etc. which is what these things are made for ironically. 😂
This leads to unnatural movement of stock prices and throws off the actual educated investors, which is bad. So today's stock market is just a dance of uneducated and educated investors orchestrated by celebrities, politicians, influencers, etc. etc. 😂

And Marques, can tell you for a fact, howmuchever you try to stop people from taking this as financial advice, some people are still gonna take it as advice and act accordingly, as explained above. 😂"

6424,"This is the most important post you will ever read.

Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.

The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. 
Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..

Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). 

Do these things, and you will be saved.

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. 

You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);

‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ."

I think the fact that people are conflating the current rise in Dogecoin to the goodwill of Shibes from 6 years ago, when there have been no new social/charitable causes around dogecoin and the suggestion that people should experiment with a currency whose value can be inflated or tanked by a tweet is an extremely irresponsible use of a large social media platform."
6435,Mk I'm going to use this as financial advice
6436,"""Mom! Marqus said we should put 2k on DogeCoin, give me the goddamn money!"""
6437,I'm waiting for elon musk's comment
6438,Side in joke turns are always welcome 🙏
6439,"Thanks for the sound financial advice, I will buy Dogecoin and come after you if I lose money"
6440,🤨
6441,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6442,You too? This is just sad.....
6443,Time to be scared 😊
6444,"Will Rogers in no way ""won"" the presidential race in 1928"
6445,Never expected such dog shit content from Marques !!!
6446,id rather buy Z cash
6447,But hey!
6448,Behold the MKBHD coin
6449,"Awfully misleading video, didn’t cover the fact that $DOGE has an unlimited supply which defeats the purpose of deflationary currency. Telling people to invest in this will definitely be a hard lesson."
6450,"Anyways, I've had Dogecoin for about 10 years now..."
6451,The amount of legal liability disclaimers made me LOL
6452,Just bought 20 for $1. 😅
6453,INVEST PLEASE MARQUES
6454,"Best sticking to phones and gadgets :) Bitcoin is regulated, look it up, how else it's listed on Coinbase plus worth approaching $1T. Hope you will clarify its legality & always have been regulated on your tweet :) Elon will approve"
6455,"I pray anyone that sees this is successful in life ,"
6456,"I knew the maker of TRON is doing a shady crap to his coin
Boosting his useless coin and then dump all of his stakes later on high prices. Bad inventor.
While the maker of DOGE sold all of his coins years ago for an old Honda Civic"
6457,Elon must be seeing this video
6458,hey thanks for explaining it to me!
6459,"MKBHD: ""I should probably take my jacket off for this disclaimer."""
6460,Well I'm sold.  How I get me some dogecoin?
6461,Let’s goooo keep the doge going I want to buy a Cybertruck with my doge one day!
6462,The real mystery? Marques turning so quickly that the hoodie disappears.
6463,i didn't bought dogocin i want catcoin catcoin
6464,People should look into the development of Raven Coin going to have a ton of uses not just for currency.
6465,Очередное видео и вода водой.
6466,Someone make a pepe coin.
6467,What does MKBHD means? 🤔
6468,Elon Musk is into something MKBHD posts
6469,"Time is running short. Believe and confess to Jesus and stop him aside before it is too late. Jesus is the only way to heaven. Not by works or by going to Church every Sunday (not saying stop attending)
John 14:6 “Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”
Romans 10:9-10 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.”
Spread the word God bless :)"
6470,Doge wouldn’t exist without the DigiByte tech built in
6471,This is not going to end well.... 1929 all over again
6472,"Nothing would make me happier than to see ""Doge"" become the global name for ""Money"" in the future."
6473,I’ve never seen so many disclaimers lmao
6474,"Despite the jitters natural in a global pandemic, cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popular support as alternatives to gold (a store of value) and the dollar (as a means of payment). We see fundamental reasons to believe that regardless of where the price of bitcoin goes next cryptocurrencies are here to stay as a serious asset class. Moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that trad:ngbitcon is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from t r a d ing till I came across Todd Gordon program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng฿₮₵ works, to help them recover loss and also stack up more building portfollo. Since late last year till date I have made over 9’B’T’C with Todd's system.

6475,You haven't explained why you ordered a Tesla. You said you would on Twitter!
6476,"Dogecoin is like Pluto, the planet that was kicked out but is still the most popular planet, and ain't nothing y'all can do about it"
6477,A big fan from india
6478,1 Doge = 1 Doge
6479,*”Doctor” Billy Gates should have started his virus as a joke. Maybe then his vaccines would have been taken more seriously.*
6480,Money can't be trusted with centralised monopolistic entities like central banks and nation states; let a thousand cryptocurrencies bloom and the best win!
6481,"I actually came here because of the dog 🤨, that's one hell of a creep dog."
6482,Weirdest cryptocurrency
6483,6:43 and also very illegal
6484,Liberal Doge.
6485,Will Rogers did not come remotely close to being elected. He ‘resigned’ on Election Day with less than 1% of the vote after Hoover won.
6486,So thats what happens when You take a JOKE seriously..
6487,It’s more random that he is talking about stocks in this channel😂
6488,"Marques: shows the emails
Me: actually looks up the links then finds out he actually showed it in the video😂"
6489,MKBHD giving investment advice...this is what I've been waiting for ahahaha
6490,"Brilliant ""Tron"" marketing. Mention it repeatedly but not to much 😉"
6491,It's interesting that cryptocurrency will never be an actual currency because it's so volatile
6492,"volatility is terrible in a currency.  these are investments, like pork belly futures, not really currency.  if people wanted a currency, they'd be looking for the coin with the most stable value, not the ones that spike up and down.  seems like almost a misnomer at this point."
6493,disappointed in this video. 10 minutes and you fail to mention that there's no cap on how much Doge can be produced.
6494,$SFP to the moon
6495,"Will Rogers did not win the 1928 elections. He ‘declared’ victory and then resigned, but he never actually got many voted or won anything. Could have easily been fact-checked. Great video tho!"
6496,"When Marques turns left 
His jacket comes off 
Such good trick 😂😂"
6497,"Never forget, 1 Dogecoin = 1 Dogecoin"
6498,The day has when even this guy started talking about Crypto 😒
6499,Where are all my r/wallstreetbets degenerates? to the moon 🚀
6500,Small supprt ❤️
6501,"Even after Marques legal advise
Other people : *hehe*"
6502,"Him : doggy style
Her : Doge style"
6503,"Sorry to be that guy but it really can’t hit 0 dollars. That’s kinda impossible considering that if at least one person owns even one doge it is worth something even if it is a microscopic amount. Same with any crypto really though. 


Anyway
1 DOGE = 1 DOGE"
6504,Elon is pretty much running pump and dump scheme with doge coin.
6505,Doge to ¢10 !!!!
6506,the WHAT now?
6507,"Hahaha... Marques really shouldn't be talking crypto. Did you just say alt coins are easy to create?! You are so clueless. Worst video of your YouTube career. 
PS. Dogecoin is completely useless. Zero development since it was created."
6508,Mkbhd out of the closet as a full-on NWO sponsored agent
6509,You really need to turn down brightness when filming 😵
6510,A joke that's gonna make me rich!🤣🤣🤣
6511,Anyone else buying CAT Token $CAT on uniswap ?  Or is it just me?  The new DOGE coin.
6512,The middle marques needs to be in more videos
6513,As an Australian I think I speak for all of us when I say you're welcome
6514,"Woooow, you mentioned gram! That’s 2 of my favorite content creators on one video!"
6515,MKBHD in 5 yrs: so I created my cryptocurrency 2 weeks ago now and I’m here to review the experience
6516,Gold Coins
6517,Chainlink will be $100 by the end of March.
6518,buy it
6519,"Dogecoin is a fork of a fork of a fork. It has no utility and is a proof of work crypto. Had Elon Musk not tweeted about it, it would have been left in the trash where it belonged.. cryptos you want to invest in are DeFi tokens that have a utility factor. AMP is a good one and of course the one that's going to be a literal global currency is XRP..."
6520,"Thank you for your financial advice, I have borrowed money against my house and gone big on Dogecoin.  To the SKYYYYYYYYY!!!"
6521,"Don’t ever underestimate Internet retards, you’ve just challenged them all to get to $1"
6522,"Oii, oii, oii..... First time I see this topic on this channel, but I love it"
6523,"Dogecoin has an infinite supply cap (not the biggest deal) and a low amt of hashpower securing the network (big deal, susceptible to 51% attacks). If you’re trying to invest in crypto, I’d just buy Bitcoin."
6524,"""Currency of internet attention"" That wouldn't be doge. That would be BAT"
6525,That will rogers bit is misleading. He didn't get elected.
6526,"Don't click on random email links, you'll get hacked."
6527,Now that you've talked about it. We will be on it too lol...see how it will rise too
6528,When’s MKBHDcoin releasing?
6529,Marques really doesn't want you to take financial advice from him
6530,$DOGE TO THE MOON
6531,This guy telling bitcoin is better than other altcoins has no idea about the crypto technologies
6532,"hahahaha bro, Will Rogers never actually won and could not have been president"
6533,TriHard 7
6534,"Nobody:
MKBHD: Invest all your money in doge coin right now!"
6535,Stick being a phone reviewer and stop kissing elon ass
6536,This is going nowhere dude...
6537,I use Doge to make more Bitcoin.
6538,"Trump running for President started off as a golfing joke for old, white guys.
The joke stretched out too far, too far."
6539,"It feels like, I am exiting BTC positions as I see Amanda Cerney talk about Crypto. 🦸✨"
6540,People are going to get rekt with doge
6541,Marques just pulled TRON's pants down big time. I knew that Lindsay Lohan tweet was suspect lol
6542,TO THE MOON!!!!
6543,Nobody gonna mention the insane e-waste cryptos are causing?
6544,"Investing in a ""currency"" named for a fucking internet meme sounds like a brilliant idea."
6545,"How to pronounce this, that is all I want to know as every one says it differently"
6546,Cool runnings was one of those childhood movies you’ll never forget such a good classic
6547,I expected u to do more research. None of them are like bitcoin
6548,"Your explanation of altcoins is way off. 99.9% of them aren’t trying to be bitcoin. They are projects trying revolutionize real-world use cases such as finance, the internet, digital goods, etc

Also: tron is garbage😉"
6549,"Remember, nothing is made out of a joke in the financial world ... this is a fictional story that came out of a joke"
6550,"FUCK THIS

I'M OUT.

I LISTENED TO MARQUES ON YOUTUBE AND MARKET BOUGHT $DOGE AT 50X LEVERAGE ON FTX TODAY

NOW I'M FUCKING LIQUIDATED..AGAIN..

I'M DONE WITH CRYPTO FOR GOOD. I'M NEVER DEPOSITING ""JUST ANOTHER $1000"" ON FTX. FUCK THIS FUCKING SCAM."
6551,Wow much intrest...
6552,Much Wow!  Such matte black
6553,Its all a joke until we hit the MOON 🚀🚀
6554,any new of the one plus 9 yet
6555,"🚨 we already know what dogecoin is and also we have crypto channels to give us info.. stick to phones
🚨"
6556,"Most important thing that marques didn't mention was
*DogeCoin has unlimited supply...*
But anyway it wasn't a financial advice"
6557,"Wow, his jacket goes invisible when he turns, that's so cool"
6558,So you saying buy? Got it 👍🏻

6562,Marques talks about coinbase but you still can't buy dogecoin on coinbase
6563,HODL!!!
6564,Thanks for sharing it.
6565,"Elon can't boost teslas stock price with tweets, so he decided to do it with Doge"
6566,"FYI: There are actual cryptocurrencies you could put your hard earned money into that actually do something. Maybe inform them of those instead of a meme coin? You are all going to get dumped on and lose money the same way you did when you bought GME at 400+. Put your money somewhere else, not Dogecoin."
6567,"Is he pronouncing ""Doge"" correctly?"
6568,"Thanks for the financial advise, time to buy my life savings with in dogecoin"
6569,DogeCash till I die baby!
6570,"Am I crazy or isn't the pace of new Dogecoin s being release of supposed to increase overtime? Like if somehow gold grew in the ground at an exponential rate, I don't think it would have value. Maybe I'm ill informed."
6571,HODL
6572,"To the moon! Lads, we're going to the moon."
6573,Dogecoin Definition: “Too the Moon”
6574,You ain't going to have the same effect as Elon lol
6575,Doge coin gonna hit 2k  in 2022
6576,Its pronounced Doge
6577,Doge is a scam
6578,I think I'm gonna make Dogecoin 2
6579,Pretty glad you posted this video actually. Crypto currency and everything around it is just very interesting.
6580,"TO
THE
MOON!"
6581,"So, just to clarify, this *IS* financial advise and you *ARE* responsible for anything we do based on this video?"
6582,It would be better if u covered this topic on podcast rather than making a video abt it.
6583,"we all know Marques bought 10000 Dogecoins , c'mon !!"
6584,"With all due respect, this was probably the most uninformed you have been in a video.  Please learn more about crypto before you try to explain it to 13.6M followers.  The beginning explanation of alts is misleading. Explaining the hype of Doge is on point but please re-upload with an updated beginning.  It's just irresponsible."
6585,Either Tron is going down or this video.😂
6586,Hey Marques Ripple is not a coin it's a company! The coin you were meaning to say is XRP!
6587,"hell yea , crypto time. let's get it KANGS"
6588,ya memers are bringing some change
6589,Marques just played us.....def took that tron add money and talked about it for 2 min lol
6590,TO THE MOON
6591,"Marques: ""This isn't a financial advice video, and I'm not responsible for your actions after watching this video.""
Me: *invests in Dogecoin, suffers a loss. ""I did it on MKBHD's advice, Dad."""
6592,Hey thank you SO MUCH for the shout out! That means a lot!!
6593,"All of that dogecoin mining will finally pay off if it reaches a dollar, I would literally be a millionaire."

6595,"this was an incredible video, loved this form of video. down for more"
6596,Thank God Marques for not shilling the ultra shitcoin Tron!!!
6597,"Tron's already shown itself to be pretty scammy in the past within the Crypto Community, not surprised they're still doing their thing lol oh boy."
6598,"Link to the white Adidas hoodie he is wearing, please?"
6599,Can't tell if MKBHd not wearing the hoodie in the disclaimer cutaway is trolling or just bad continuity...very Doge-like!
6600,"You're just a great guy, damn."
6601,I really like the idea of crypto...just make some altcoin and you give yourself a million...I dont know why people invest their hard earned cash in the air...
6602,"Am i the only one disappointed that they didn't name it doggocoin...?


Doggocoin would have been more fun"
6603,wrong
6604,When he said joke become real I got reminded of joker's line : we live in a society...
6605,"You should do an interview/podcast with @RyanSAdams and @TrustlessState on twitter, they will give you the introduction to why cryptocurrencies are interesting and important. If you reach out to them I'm sure they'd be all over sitting down for a conversation!"
6606,You basically hit all the nails on the head.
6607,Soldja boi coin will run on Cardano 😅🤣
6608,Now what shud I do with my 10000 doge coins? 😭
6609,by not talking about it you are still promoting it ..............................
6610,"Will Rodgers did not win the presidential election in 1928, Herbert Hoover won and in a landslide. Hoover received 444,  Al Smith with 87 electoral votes, and Rodgers with zero. Have no idea where that story came from."
6611,To the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6612,"Disclaimer : No Tron coin was harmed during making of this video
🤣"
6613,"One word Cardano. When they get done pumping and dumping the meme coins like TRON 😅, invest in the future with Cardano Ada! You won't be sorry.. 😉💪"
6614,I love the repeated disclaimers and warnings🤣
6615,You just crashed Tron value abit
6616,Coinbase gave me $31 of free altcoins and they’re already up to $40. I like to imagine someday they’ll be worth a stupid amount despite me getting them for free.
6617,To the moon! 🚀
6618,I love this. 👊👊👊
6619,Will you donate the revenue from this video to a good cause?
6620,Buy before it’s too late folks..
6621,Dogecoin was nothing but elon's strategy....he came to know about his power with the signal tweet..... So he used it.... He directed everyone to dogecoin.... And tesla bought 1.5 billion dollar worth of bitcoin...
6622,MKBHD not only explains everything wisely but also somehow convince us 99.99% on that thing deeply wow man what a skill you got love you bro from india.
6623,Wow marques changing his hoodie so fast before and after disclaimer it's so funny man 😂😂
6624,The intern at Tron who sent you this email is gonna be posting on LinkedIn tomorrow that they are available for work. 😳
6625,Coinye West will never be topped.

6631,When MKBD is talking about schitCoins we are officially in a bear market and done with the bull market :( pack up guys. Time to sell now
6632,Marques Doge Brownlee
6633,I thought it was pronounced doojee coin until marques said doj coin
6634,I bet if we graph the release of this video with the increase it’s about to get in some way marques and Elon can basically manipulate the stock
6635,I almost bought a few weeks back when it was at 3 cents.
6636,6:38 big oof bigger cringe
6637,What’s up Broski 🦋🦋
6638,Respect for Marques' approach on sponsorships👍
6639,Would u buy it now?
6640,Doge 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌝 (let’s hope not the dark side of the moon) 😂
6641,"The fact that there are people in the world who didn't immediately get the Cool Runnings reference makes me feel oooold. Aging is weird, man."
6642,I don't like the idea of bitcoin. Mostly because I haven't bought enough yet. If I had like at least 10 then maybe I would like it.
6643,"Love the video but Will Rogers didn’t win the presidential race in 1928, he was an amazing man though"
6644,As we’ve been waiting for.
6645,Bong
6646,The reason for success of Dogecoin is *ELON MUSK*
6647,"With the Tesla/Elon stuff, and now this, I have to unsubscribe. Way too much Reddit cringe culture for me. Jesus Christ."
6648,Does cuts to disclaimers are the best haha
6649,Doge could easily reach $1 eventually. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was less than $1 five years ago. Its at like $16 now.
6650,"Thanks Marques for the ""financial advise""!"
6651,Dogecoin to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀
6652,"From techs to meme stocks, MKBHD covers everything"
6653,"Please god no... please tell me you didn't feel the need to clarify a ""Cool Runnings"" reference... please, I can't be that old..."
6654,cool
6655,Thank you for the financial advice Marques
6656,"I threw some money at it like a month ago just for giggles. I honestly felt like nothing would come of it.  But hey why not just buy 500 shares while its so cheap. If anything happens im paid, if it goes through the ground meh. Ive wasted so much money on gaming over the years ill be fine lol. But its clearly a pump and dump coin right now"
6657,"is pronounced as ""doggy-coin"" not doje-coin, where are u ppl getting ur meme news?"
6658,"""Tech Video.... Kind of""
Lol"
6659,"Not financial advice but I'll give you all the hidden gem in crypto.

It's Syscoin. The devs have been working on it since 2014, even after all their funding got stolen once. They have consistently been on the bleeding edge of tech in a very fast moving space, they have founded a company in Canada and it's market cap is criminally low compared to the tech it brings to the table."
6660,"Will Rogers didn't actually win, he just declared he did as part of his satire"
6661,holy shit the tops is in when my favorite youtuber starts to talk about crypto currency
6662,"5:00 sorry, but Will Rogers didn't actually win the election. He declared himself the winner on election day (in 1928 the results were not known the day of) and then immediately ""resigned""."
6663,Imma1st.
6664,Mkbhd using the S21 Ultra ??? Hmmmm
6665,Marques *this is not financial acvice* Brownlee here...
6666,"5:07 soooo just like the campaign for ""deez nutz"" several years ago"
6667,I still don't understand stocks. 😭😂
6668,Thanks for explaining
6669,I know that chances are close to zero but I would love for the currency of the future to have a meme origin.
6670,In Doge we trust.
6671,MKBHDCoin [MKB] to the moon 🚀🚀
6672,🌎🐕🚀🌝
6673,"Elon Musk is the top dog. He puts money in dogecoin, then tweets and makes 💰💸 😎"
6674,"Uh... Will Rogers did not win the 1928 election. He declaimed victory and resigned as part of the joke, but he didn't actually win. Kinda disappointing to see this kind of factual error in a video, considering how easy this would be to fact check."
6675,I prefer to invest my money in something else. But i wish good look to everyone who invest their money in any crypto currency 👌👌
6676,Was Marques trying to position his head like doge while giving advice or disclaimer? Reading too much into meme?
6677,Trons coin CEO is a known as the Crypto Villain
6678,Bullish after this video! Let’s go. 🚀🌕
6679,Its time to make BATCOIN!
6680,Not lohan...
6681,Imagine asking Marques to promote your alt coin on twitter but he ended up talking about how sketchy you are in one of his videos 😂😂😂😂😂😂
6682,Everything Is Changing
6683,"No... No...NO to Cool Running! I SPIT in that movie's general direction!!!! They didn't even use real jamaican actors as the mains. I hate that movie with a passion. The fake accents sound like nails on a chalkboard with mumble rap playing in the background. I understand the its supposed to be a comedic interpretation and all but so much of it is inaccurate. 
This is coming from a jamaican who has met the real Dudley Stokes and my mother  grew up with his wife. I remember watching it when I was 13 and living in Jamaica and I felt so insulted by that rubbish. Its like memoirs of a geisha and instead of using Japanese actresses they us Chinese and Malaysian. Cool Running can go kick rocks! 😡😠🤬👿😾"
6684,Good one
6685,ugghh giving DOGE any airtime is terrible.  Fucking TRON scam is the worst and all the people that accepted money to shill for it should be charged.
6686,"I'm pretty sure the creator meant ""Dog-e-coin"""
6687,"Instructions not clear.
All in on DOGE"
6688,I've seen idiocracy and demolition man. Most likely doge coin will be the only cash of 2035
6689,TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

6695,"If elon makes eloncoin, doge will be dead and I'll have to transfer. Till then I'm keeping a close eye on trends in whether to buy or transfer. Hopefully this video drives prices up though."
6696,"I remember when MKBHD laughed at bitcoin, I'm sure he has a bag now"
6697,"I can’t be the only one the waits to watch MKBHD videos on my 4K television so that I can really absorb the beauty. 

Right?"
6698,I'm getting a doge coin now just in case
6699,DODGECOIN TO THE MOON
6700,MKBHD meets sunraybee
6701,wait so should i throw $100 into dogecoin for fun?
6702,What's your source for Will Rogers winning presidency? Wikipedia says he ran. That he *declared* victory and resigned. Not that he actually won.
6703,First 😊😎😏
6704,Best explaination so far
6705,WOW
6706,For a second i thought he was wearing a lab coat😂😂
6707,"I hate the way you pronounce Dogecoin, and you say it _a lot._"
6708,I need that adidas hoodie.. anyone has a link?
6709,Legend😂😂😂😂

I feel like I'm going crazy, I couldn't see anyone mentioning this in the comments and I searched all over the web and couldn't find anything more than he ""declared victory"" which is completely meaningless. Can you imagine if he actually won on a joke campaign and resigned? That would have been one of the largest scandals in American history. Do you not think we'd have learned about that in school, or had been talking about it endlessly during Trump's campaign in 2016? Jesus. I feel like I'm going crazy but that's all I can think about, how was that such a nonchalant story to just drop in the video as if it were true?"

6747,"As a small math youtube channel that teaches number theory and cryptography, I'd like to give 2 cents. The best cryptocurrency, in the long run, is the cryptocurrency with the most speed and security. Bitcoin is a rough draft cryptocurrency. Many people have better ideas about how to run a cryptocurrency. Just because Ford made the first car doesn't mean Ford will always be the biggest car manufacturer. Tesla made a point, and so will the smaller cryptocurrencies with more robust features."

I recently made a video trying to explain Reddit/Social Media’s impact on GameStop stock and “meme” stocks in general, but your video really highlights that the actual coin itself really doesn’t matter at all, the story around it is the most important thing.

6895,Dogecoin after mkbhd's video 🚀
6896,"look Marquees, u displayed Tron on your video for a couple of seconds there it felt like an advert too.. but this comment is about the supposed work Doge coin is doing in Kenya, Africa, there is no such work on the ground here, so thats probably cap or our ever  corrupt politicians already sized anything from that. we would love to get some of that doge coin help tho alot of us dont eat for days"
6897,Ahhh the good old meme days...
6898,"I hope Elon Musk names his first city ""DOGEMANIA"""

6901,I bought in at $0.07
6902,Checking my Robinhood app to see if my ROI is going up on dogecoins right after this...
6903,Now the dogecoin price will again spike cause Marques made a video about it...

6913,Proof of stake blockchains like Cardano are the future of cryptocurrency

6915,Cool runnings is amazing mannnn
6916,"For those wondering, Marques is using the app called Coinbase; its simple and transactions are quick."
6917,TLDR: DOGE TO THE MOON and Marques announced his running for president in 2069
6918,This is exactly what happens when Investors like musk try to take market for the ride!
6919,"Dogecoin could actually make the most sense as an actual currency since it's as I understand it's constantly undergoing inflation rather than deflation like most (all?) other cryptocurrencies seem to do. 

TLDR: Inflation while bad is way better than deflation if you're trying to make an economy work. Nobody would buy anything if they could get twice the number of stuff for just waiting a few weeks for their currency to be worth more. 
Source: Economics Explained made several videos where he talks about how bad deflation is."
6920,Congrats if you found this comment
6921,Elon manipulating the market. There is no way he doesn't know how his cult reacts to his tweets.

6931,"So many people are going to get rich from a joke coin but many more will lose everything.

6935,"0:05 ""tech video kinda"" - what do you mean? Anything that isn't electronic gadgets are not technology?? The whole cryptocurrency runs on a ""Technology"" called Block-Chain which you mention in the video. But I am disappointed that of all the people, you would say this."

6956,Fun fact: This video is not financial advice
6957,Marques really did a good job not making it look like he's promoting TRON.
6958,"This is like joker's meme line ""we live in a society"" become an actual line in the movie 😂"

6969,Aw shit now you're going to pump it
6970,lol I remember when I first got into crypto I bought tron since it as being deemed the ETH killer. and I've never lost money faster lol
6971,Hey marques have you heard SPITCOIN
6972,Funny! How doge started as joke and now people take seriously and many old crypto started seriously but now is a joke!
6973,We are basically living in a meme controlled economy now. What a weird time to be alive.
6974,"bitcoin consumes more energy than argentina! if it were a country it would be ranked 30th in energy use, in the world! terrible for global warming!"
6975,"Wait a minute 
You just promoted Tron while telling us they emailed you to say they need yoj to promote them without making it seem like an ad 😂"
6976,I’m salty I sold my 10k doge coins in July after making 15 bucks saying good enough for me... RIP. Just threw a few bucks in it since this video will boost it a bit
6977,Elon approves this message. 👌
6978,Hey MKBHD the vaccine came out have you been using it for a week now 😂😂😂
6979,Marques knows exactly what we are searching for.
6980,"i think one thing that should of been mentioned here is that this pump came after the GME boost. doge has always been a meme and I think the reason it recently caught on fire was that the GME situation made people realize ""wow...we have a lot of power"". so while there is no one being squeezed in doge, the belief in mass pumping is even stronger. this coupled with what marques said about elon tweeting, made it boom to as high as 9 cents I believe.

definitely think its worth investing. at some point its bound to pop off again and 5 cents is a discount. Even if it drops back down to below a penny, it's just a matter of time. but like he said, invest what you are willing to lose when it comes to more risky assets"
6981,Its doggy not doge
6982,Matt is doge prince 😄
6983,i bet mkbhd is already in about a 100 grand.

7058,Dogecoin...... Interesting 🚗🤔
7059,"Don't understand how something which creates no good value to a human or nature gets interest from people.... Its just a mass hysteria, probably driven indirectly by hostile countries to fund arms and drug supplies."
7060,My family bought 2 shibas back in 1999. When my parents divorced we had to sell.. will forever regret.

7063,Dogecoin...... Interesting 🚗🤔
7064,Didn't everyone say bitcoin would never hit $1? Now look at it. Hold the coin everyone. Crypto is the future and doge is the people's currency. It's journey to the moon is inevitable
7065,Why do we even entertain such concepts?
7066,Literally the entire global network of banking < funny dog money
7067,I’ve always used doge to transfer! It has lesser fees

7070,Get a doge ad before the video
7071,Yep
7072,I feel like it should be pronounced “Doggycoin”
7073,The thing is that podcast is something we don’t usually hear as we already have a lot platform for news and information.
7074,This guy is literally prompting dogecoin he was involved they message him and payed
7075,Dogecoin tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Mars
7076,Can someone tell exactly how to start investing
7077,"The problem with Dogecoin or any other crypto is that the transactions are made hoping that later on, someone else will buy it at a higher price, even if the asset does not produce cash flow or have any intrinsic value. This practice usually falls under the term 'speculation' not 'investment.' Also, usually if people do not like being questioned about their investments they are not investing, their speculating!"
7078,"If you are putting projects like ethereum in the same bag as doge as an ""altcoin"", then you clearly don't know what you are talking about. Altcoins from 2010 to 2015 aprox were just Bitcoin clones with very minimal changes like a few parameters here, a different algorithm there, but essentially exactly the same. So probably that's what you read.
But from the creation of Ethereum, and projects like NXT (later forked to become NEM) brought true innovation to the space, expanding enourmously what cryptocurrencies could offer, from just a transactional database to a decentralized platform.
Doge is just a bitcoin clone, like litecoin, which don't bring much innovation to the space. The fact that these two survived and still has market cap is just mind blowing to me."
7079,"Dang, Marques is savage calling out Lindsay Lohan, Ne-Yo, and Lil Yachty. But what they did was pretty illegal."
7080,How much they paying for a tweet that even millionaire celebs are willing to take on the deal?
7081,Doge the ruler of economy
7082,"If you have a napkin, a crayon, and a functional brain, it is clear that Dogecoin is a waste of time and money."
7083,"Marques: Uploads a video
Everyone else:  tHe rEtUrN oF tHe kInG."
7084,I thought it was pronounced Doggy Coin
7085,"Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin MKBHD trust me. Bitcoin was meant to get rid of banks, BTC was infiltrated by the powers that be  and is being subjugated by banks. They are trying to make BTC custodial only just like a regular fiat bank account. Not your keys not your coins."

7091,That's what I can afford. Investing.
7092,The Red Phone on Marques desk is Elon Musk.
7093,🚀🚀🚀 chain
7094,You definitely left out the part about doge doing this in every bull market and then going dormant again it’s done it every time although this time I must admit the volume is different. You also left out the part about 21 addresses owning approximately 54% of all DOGE thus putting you at their mercy. Whenever they decide game over...then it’s game over. You can literally go look at the lifetime chart for DOGE and see how these 21 addresses trade it back and forth and play around with it. Shitcoin is what it is.
7095,“So I’ve had about $2 million in dogecoin for about 2 weeks now....”
7096,“Ripple”

7129,This video was so Well Scripted.  Concise - to the point.  No wandering - no meandering - no going on and on and on and on and on and .......
7130,"If you want an easy 10x, just buy Phantasma (SOUL) and wait a few weeks.  Thank me later."
7131,Plot twist: This is like the Tron thing and Dogecoin founders sponsored to make this video but not to make it like promoting it.
7132,Marques removing and wearing his hoodie again and again is literally giving me seizure
7133,Good job Marques! Please cover stonks as well besides tech.

7153,"the  dog on the meme just died, its a great tribute i guess. haha"
7154,Marques: I am once again asking for you to not take my opinion as financial advice
7155,Stonks going up
7156,The fact that Marques mentioned one of my all time favorite movies in Cool Runnings makes me so happy.

7378,"Facts: The meme Dog ""Gen"" passed away yesterday."
7379,Someone should make a baby Yoda coin.
7380,Wrong: BTC is regulated. Very common misconception the media has
7381,"The network has a large total token supply of 117,765,025,366 DOGE and no fixed limit (inflation currently ~1.2%), a deliberate tokenomics decision in order to keep the price of each individual token low.

An original intention for DOGE was to become an online tipping medium to leave small appreciation gifts for reddit comments, youtube videos and charity initiatives, so small individual token denominations support this utility""

Doge isn’t an investment. It’s a utility. If you want to get into to crypto, start with Ethereum and Bitcoin."
7382,The power of Elon's tweets..
7383,lmao fuck tron
7384,Can you do a Bitcoin video?

7394,"Ok, is everyone shilling this doge coin, nobody takes it seriously, you are going to lose all your money, same es gamestop, amc... Elon musk starts to be like a religion...."

8477,"Wonderful content. Well personally I feel those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in cryptocurrency world in general or probably just naive and afraid to take risk.
Cryptocurrency have seen far more worse times than this.
Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions.
Few months back, I started trading, though I knew just the basics of trading. I have seen a lot of money being made by people in just few weeks of trading. this was a motivation for me to go into crypto trading full time.
I wasn't able to capture the secret to understanding the use of signals so I lost huge amount of money due to inexperience untill I got connected to a trading expert Ms Rachael Davis on t-e-l-e-g-r-a-m.

Under her guide I've been able to make profits on crypto trading."

اگر آپ بغیر انویسٹمنٹ کے پیسے کمانا چاہتے ہیں تو یہ پوسٹ خاص آپ کے لیے ہے۔
میں آج آپ کو ایک کرپٹو ایکسچینج کے بارے میں بتاتا ہوں، جس پر اکاؤنٹ بنا کر اور اپنے اکاؤنٹ کی تصدیق کروا کر ، آپ اس ایکسچینج سے بغیر انویسٹمنٹ کے پیسے کما سکتے ہیں ۔
جی ہاں! آپ کو اپنی جیب سے ایک روپیہ بھی انویسٹ کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں۔
اپنے اکاؤنٹ کی تصدیق کروانے کے لیے آپ کے پاس موبائل، ای میل اور شناختی کارڈ ہونا لازمی ہے ، ان چیزوں کے بغیر آپ کے اکاؤنٹ کی تصدیق نہیں ہو گی۔
اکاؤنٹ کی تصدیق کے بعد آپ کو روزانہ صرف 5 منٹ تک کام کرنا ہوگا۔اود آپ یہ کام اپنے موبائل پر بھی کر سکتے ہیں۔ ، جو آپ نے صرف 60sec فی آرٹیکل پڑھنا ہے۔ یعنی کل ملا کر 5 منٹ میں 5 آرٹیکل کھولنے ہیں۔ اس کام کے بدلے یہ آپ کو 400 ستوشی دے گی۔
ستوشی بٹ کوئن کی اکائی ہے۔ جیسے پیسہ ہمارے روپیہ کی اکائی ہے۔
اس 5 منٹ کے کام کے آپ کو روزانہ 400 ستوشی ملیں گے، اور جب آپ کے پاس 10,000 ستوشی جمع ہو جائیں گے، تب آپ یہ رقم نکلوا سکتے ہیں۔
رقم نکلوانے کا طریقہ یہ ہے کہ سب سے پہلے آپ یہ رقم اپنے بٹ کوئن والٹ میں ٹرانسفر کریں گے، اور اس کے بعد بینک یا جازکیش یا ایزی پیسہ وغیرہ کے ذریعے اپنی رقم نکلوا سکتے ہیں۔
میں یہاں بتاتا چلوں کہ اس بات کی 💯 فیصد گارنٹی ہے اور اس کے لیے آپ کو ایک دھیلا بھی انویسٹ کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں۔
اس کے علاوہ اگر آپ اپنی آمدنی میں تیزی کے ساتھ اضافہ کرنا چاہتے ہیں تو آپ اس میں اپنے دوستوں کو بھی جوائن کروائیں، کیونکہ جب آپکا ایک دوست 400 ستوشی کمائے گا تو آپ کو بھی مفت میں بغیر کوئی کام کیے 400 ستوشی ملیں گے، یہ ایکسچینج کی طرف سے آپ کو تحفہ ہے اپنے دوستوں کو جوائن کروانے کا۔ اس لیے کوشش کریں کہ سبھی دوستوں کو اس میں جوائن کروا لیں تا کہ آپ کی آمدن میں تیزی آ سکے۔
اگر آپ 24 دوستوں کو جوائن کروا لیتے ہیں جو روزانہ 400 ستوشی کما لیں۔ تو آپ روزانہ 10,000 ستوشی نکلوا سکیں گے ۔
10,000 ستوشی کا ریٹ اس وقت 600/550 روپے سے بھی زیادہ ہے، اور بٹ کوئن کرنسی کی بڑھتی ہوئی قیمت کی وجہ سے اس میں اضافہ ہوتا رہے گا۔
تو اگر میں حساب لگاؤں کہ آپ روزانہ 10,000 ستوشی کماتے ہیں تو آپ کی ماہانہ آمدن تقریباً 19,500 روپے ہو گی"

9028,"I must say. Bitcoin's price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why it's advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Tony Konrad. He is always one step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 6.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM @ Tktrade7"

9058,"The biggest lesson I've learned about trading Cryptos lately is they are very hard to predict and I suck at it :( One thing to keep in mind is that money or really currency is never created on cryptos, this means you have to be in the top half of traders just to make a profit and it's not really the top half because the professional traders control well over half the currency in the market. , seeing a crypto has tanked and predicting there is a greater chance of it rising before it has passed the day moving average has failed for me on several occasions, finding the right entry and exit point on my own did not workout for me like I  expected but the reality is you have to have patience and wait until everything is correct so I got some help  with Sheldon Evans on youtube  who showed me how to navigate exploit crypto to my advantage despite the volatility   I got I7 btc in 2 moths with it.Sheldon can be reached on Tҽʅҽqɾαɱ.@Cryptosheldon there is the realism of winning and losing but the losing does not hurt too bad because i recover quickly by making smarter decisions."
9059,"Sir, what I most love about your video is that you always say *JAI HIND* at the of the video.❤👏"
9060,"Nice contents you put up always .BTC hits a new bullish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see now the market is very unstable, the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket. Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of trading. I wept deeply and prayed after the last time i had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to Green Trust, with whom i started trading with since late last year, i've covered up and made over 31 BTС with 2 BTC even with the ups and downs since the journey. With they are counsel I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin. You can easily get them through his TeIegram= greentrustinvestment"
9061,"It's interesting how Crypto market is becoming more appealing to lnv estors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, U.S investment bank noted that high volatility acts as a headwind towards further adoption with no doubt in mind that we are not only going bull with little signs of stopping. I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the amount of institutions, and companies like Tesla, who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollaRs with the intent to hold long term: how can we refute that this may be the ""super cycle"" everyone is talking about? The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. I got this tips first hand from Dr Bruce Olsen, He’s always a step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money.

9282,"Great video, I must say. Bitcoin's price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum.

He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead.

After bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coins, rendering it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $75 billion, and traded daily at an average volume of $9 billion..I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough,but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to proper analyse the digital market.but all that Changed when I encountered Brennan Carson services and training. I must confess it was easier to understand and trade the market with the assistance of Brennan Carson within the space of 4weeks I was able to make $110k Worth in DogEcoin with start capital of $35k,truth be told His methods are top notch and prof!table and he can be contacted easily on ͲҽӀҽցɾąʍ as [ *BrennanCarson* ] for Crypt0 related concern"

9487,Also how else do you think he used doge money to buy a rocket or satellite to send to the moon? He fooled everyone. Not me
9488,Do people really not understand? The chart indicators were already high ready to consolidate again. It had to also come down to finish the massive inverted head and shoulders pattern. I drew a chart and told everyone on webull to sell 74 and reenter at 40 to 44 cents and they all called me a clown.. You have to think like a millionaire. Elon musk purposely unloaded doge shares because he wasn't going to buy that high so he sold to bring it down not only so he could buy cheaper but like I said to finish the inverted head and shoulders. Doge now going to 1.20 or 1.30 then dip to 80 or 90 then pop to 1.60 or 1.80.. Watch..

Zu Beginn der Handelssitzung dieser Woche wechselt der neutrale Wochenausblick zwischen Verlusten und Gewinnen, was es für Anleger schwierig macht, zu entscheiden, wie der aktuelle Markt am besten genutzt werden soll. Für mich kann es nicht offensichtlicher sein, dass der Handel mit Bitcoin viel lukrativer ist, als nur zu hetzen und darauf zu warten, dass der Preis für Bitcoin in die Höhe schnellen kann. Ich dachte nicht, dass es möglich wäre, durch den Handel einen konstanten Gewinn zu erzielen, bis ich auf das Anthony Perez-Programm für Investoren / Neulinge stieß, die nicht verstehen, wie der Handel mit Bitcoin funktioniert, um ihnen dabei zu helfen, Verluste nach dem Absturz auszugleichen und seitdem auch mehr Bitcoin zu stapeln Ende letzten Jahres bis heute habe ich mit Hilfe von Anthony über 19 BTC von 2,6 Btc gemacht.

Richard baker was advised by my friend who has actually enjoyed trading for many years. She informed me to first attempt the demo trade mode to get more understanding about the automobile trading system. I chose to try it due to the reality that I got curious, I'm glad I gave it a shot at Richard. In 3 weeks, Richard helped me turn my trade from 1.5 bitcoin to 4 bitcoin. For both beginners and experts,  this Richard baker is without a doubt the very best in the business!

9542,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI. His daily trade s!gnals has really helped me grow my !nvestment in the crypt0 m@rket and with the right mentorship and str@tegy, crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for newbies and lnvestor.

9610,"From the look of things and according to experts in the crypto space. This period the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals, this i have been doing with Mr Joseph Robinson's  daily signals which has been so accurate and well profitable, Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 6.8btc with my initial 3.2btc which you would agree is a very good profits. I see no reason to panic when you can build your portfolio with Joseph Robinson's daily signals and guides, Joseph can be reached on  and Telegram @josephrobinsoncrypto for inquiries into profitable trading systems."

However I guess just my guess in 50 cents level some whales did buy a large amount of doge just in order to prevent a catastrophic drop
SNL reminds me Tesla battery day Tesla dropped so heavy almost catastrophic drop 
I remember very shy Musk explained about new battery technology Why he is so shy when he is speaking in public ?!

Shyness is bad thing I don’t now how he did succeed In his life but some people did not get shy people

9753,"Bought the dip & took a nap. Sorry to see so much panic over this lol. If you're scared, buy silver, ammo & drugs."
9754,When I seen that big dip I knew it was the account who’s been making huge plays all week (same account that did the 50m Bitcoin play earlier this week).IMO I think Elon meant it was a hustle as a good thing and not bad.the old investors that bash doge and crypto in general took it as a chance to scare the small time investors like they do with stocks.I see Bloomberg do this tactic daily on stocks and now the crypto market smh

9784,"In my opinion, Dogecoin grows up so aggressively before the SNL show is because people are so excited when Elon Musk mentioned about Dogecoin  with his tweet and responsive.
But when after the show, the price low down, to be honest actually that is normal to any crypto currency or businesses, people will take an advatage to take profit when they have the chances, whoever they are either a whale or just a kitty fish. But what my point is, Doincoin is  still on going, up and down as should be. 

So, dont be panic or fomo. If you believed Dogecoin and you know what do you want and what is your expectation either on long run or just playing around then that is because you choose it not because of Elon Musk or whoever, Is it make a sense? 

So take it easy guys… lf you decided to stay, then Buy now. This is the perfect time to buy more and sell when the price is high or HOLD it if you choose for a long run.

Knowledge is Power. The more your know, the less your fear…xoxo"
9785,How do I view the whales
9786,"Elon either deleted that tweet or someone faked it, because it isn't on his twitter anymore"
9787,"THESE DAYS IF YOU'RE NOT SPENDING TO RECOVER,THEN STOP SPENDING 💰"
9788,I wonder if that whale who is buying was Elon?  I can see a savvy investor like him waiting for people with the ability to tank his investment to sell off before he puts a large amount of money in. And if it’s not a financial investment in the form of a Doge purchase he’s doing; I can totally see him wanting a crypto to have a more even distribution of its coins before he begins accepting it as payment. What good is taking it as currency if the only people that have enough to buy anything are a small handful of people while the rest of us might only be able to buy a couple of dollars worth of product?
9789,Mrs Lisa is legit and her method works like magic I keep onf earning every single week with her new strategy
9790,Hello Friends. Just now I have seen one tweet on spacex about Dogecoin which related. Plz have a look and update us on ur channel.
9791,"If they bought a billion worth doge then why didn't the value go up ?
I understand your support towards the coin but in reality has doge done any good ? Any projects anything which we can trust? Whales are going to buy n sell but people like us will never get what we want."
9792,hodl or sell
9793,"Hello guys, RobinHood crash everybody last night and I crash Robin Hood last night. Robinhood got lucky the I  only have $1000 in my account.  On five minutes I make 5000. Real money."
9794,"#dogecoin don't Panic sell, buy them all dips, then whales stop the dumping"
9795,Doesn't this just mean that the big whales ran off with the money and they're looking to make more 😒?
9796,"I get tired after watching this video. Slow TF down.. He is thinking so fast, that his mouth  is too slow for his brain."
9797,Revolut will list Doge!☄☄☄☄And Gemini is offering 2.5% APY on Doge's savings... good news today....😉
9798,"They're not ""artificially pushing"" the price down. They're ACTUALLY pushing it down point blank period."

9800,Nothing is going to happen hahaha and you FinanceValueGuy should have a snickers you sound like a diva
9801,guys i have £78 in my wallet. how much should u put into doge?
9802,#dogecoin is experiencing a #deadcatbounce . The price will stop increasing around .57 and drop down to .37 or below before consolidating.

9820,Doge to $1 tonite 100%
9821,Its at 55 cent right now this morning it was 40
9822,"Bro . The fundamentals of   doge is weak . All these talks of so called backers are purely speculative. We have to remember that there is no cap of supply for doge in comparison to other cryptos like bitcoin and ether . So it’s only a hustle . Further , if a coin depends entirely on a single person then it do not have any future as we witnessed today . When elon said it’s a hustle, the value plummeted . Feel very sorry for the retail investors."
9823,"you are wrong aswell. dogecoin already crashed when elon and his mom talked about her motherday present dogecoin (which she didnt want) thats when it crashed. her words ""i am excited for my mothersday gift, i just hope its not dogecoin"""
9824,"My lessons learnt: Buy the dip, never the hype --- buy the rumor, sell the news. And be patient, don't be emotional on trading. This was a great lessons for me, now time to wait."
9825,"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crpto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Prof James program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.

9853,"Despite the economic crisis, this is a Still a good time to invest in Gold and Crypto"
9854,Doge is rising rn
9855,"Buy the hype, sell the news! It didn't matter what Elon said. People with massive Doge holdings bet against Doge and dumped as soon as he mentioned it. They made money by selling it and by shorting it in the derivatives exchange. And they kept the price down all night to ensure they'd win their short."

9888,"Since the last week of March, Mon;ero has seen exponential growth. A low of $204 seen during March 25 and a high of $438 a week ago represented gains of over 110% and for the last few sessions, the rally was kept at bay under the $440-mark and some bearishness was noted in the market. According to Awesome Oscillator’s red bars, momentum was on the bearish side, but the hourly timeframe did see a positive switch up. A strong region of support lay at $388 and maintain this would allow for a breakout above $440. Meanwhile, ADX rested at 15 and highlighted a weak trend. The 24-hour trading volumes jumped by 40% in the last 24-hours but were yet to touch $1 Billion. Expect some sideways movement before the volumes jump further because the v0latility nature of the crpytO asset is a plus for trαders because it's good for trαdiing and if trαdes are placed correctly that's constant profits which in turn increases your portfolio, which is why I copy trade with Burwell Coleman because his trαde signals are the most accurate and I have been making 6btc every month for the last eight months in a row. His on ահαեsαթթ (+44 7723 022159) and Gm@il (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom). Burwell is so good that I can attest to the accuracy of his trαde s!gnαls which is why I would recommend him for any trαder looking to stay profitable."

10025,"Bitcoin isn't volatile.... the dollar is. 1 BTC is still worth 1 BTC
since its inception. Can we say that about the dollar? $1 from 1913 to
2020 is worth ~$20 according to an inflation calculator. So, which one
is really volatile? People need to stop looking at the price through
the lens of the dollar. Everyone sees the dollar value of Bitcoin but
don't realize that it's the dollar that is weak against BTC....that's
why there are huge price swings. People also don't realize that every
time they sell or buy crypto, they are expanding the current monetary
money supply. If you know how the current monetary system works, that
last statement will make perfect sense. If not, it will go over
heads.I take the risk of lower prices on the short term for granted,
knowing that the prices will be much higher on the long term. I am not
taking the risk of not having invested what I could (because I was
waiting for lower prices) and than not take full advantage of the bull
run.There is a significant difference between stocks which can be
based on professional advice held and currencies (cryptocurrency), and
this is because most of them are hypes and highly speculative. I have
made over $80,000 in the last two months day trading my BTC which I am
sure would be a fantasy if I where hodling. I trade with a platform
that is highly skilled in the cryptocurrency business, I was
introduced by Mr Eric bishop, I am aiming for higher highs. If you
have any inquiries, you can reach him on Gmail(eric.bishop100@gmailcom) I am spreading this for those who
are unable to turn in consitent profit in the crypto market



I started investing in Cryptocurrency fairly recently. Coming from a
non-technical background, understanding blockchain and crypto currency
is a little tricky. So to understand it better I invested USD 1000 and
started to pay attention to everything related to Cryptocurrency. i
made 2 BTC real quick in 2018, later lost 1BTC early 2019, i was still
trying hard to understand the market but everything was new to me
again (nightmare). I began to read several blog post and following
YouTube video tutorials to understand how I can make profit but the
more I try, the more I loose more of my Bitcoin. So not until I found
a beginners trading post talking about a strategy on how to trade and
make profit and I contacted the person in charge, Mr bishop he
explained to me the different ways to make profit in this bearish
market. I decided to give it a try and I invested 2 BTC of my coin,
and it quickly rose to 8 BTC towards the end of December 2019,and I
was convinced it is the best way to make a good profit from Bitcoin.
If you're still confused about the steps to take this year I urge you
to contact Eric.bishop100@gmail.comfor all
your cryptocurrency questions, strategy and beginners coaching.?





My best guess is that money pours into crypto during the first 2
quarters of the year as people get their tax returns and invest in
projects they like. During this time I expect a significantly rising
overall ""market cap"". I think it will cool off some during the summer
and pick back up around the holidays as families and friends get
together and reflect on 2020. During this time I believe we'll see
periods with bitcoin gaining faster than alts, followed by times where
alts are more profitable. The smart, stress free investor is hedged
into several crypto projects as opposed to ""all in"" on one or
frequently switching back and forth between alts and bitcoin. The
market will likely remain volatile but I believe with QUALITY cryptos,
highs will be higher and lows will be higher.Those with patience
who've only invested money they can afford to lose will likely
outperform most ""traders"". I think changing tax laws in first world
countries will further embolden the HOLD mindset, as (in the US) there
is a huge benefit to investors holding assets over a year, much higher
taxes for assets held under a year. I think these changing tax laws
will also encourage investors to look harder at projects they are
comfortable Holding for over a year, so some of the pump and dump
energy will fade. feel free to get in touch with my trusted broker
davislingardcrypto11@gmail.com and he will be sure to provide you every
necessary info you may need to invest wisely in bitcoin and alt coins
.



When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because
my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I
began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more
than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and
can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got
to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this
done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market
outburst in December 2019 was more than enough for me to have a belief
that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some
trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading about
and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I
was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market.
I invested in some coin that eventually ran out of the market in 2019
it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i
wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of
the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video May this year where I
saw some individuals showering praises on this trader Davis Lingard,
so I contacted him his trading signals are really accurate unlike any
signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making
sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet
you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my 1BTC into
5BTC in two weeks and three days I was so amazing because I was tired
of constant losing of my coins here is his contact via Email
davislingardcrypto11@gmailcom  for
inquiries and other insights into trading."

10030,"Nice shot  Mate. Bitcoin a new bearish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see now the market is very unstable , the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just holding and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hold and sell but rather the potentials of trading  BTC would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started tradn with Prof Kingson Bill  since late last year and to date have made over 18 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey. With Prof Kingson Bill  counsel I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin, You can easily get to Prof Kingson Bill  on ?? l???a? {( @KingSonSignal)?? for Crypto related issues."

10339,"Extremely point by point video 🚀 Well I will also say this here,  Most people don't understand the CONCEPT of ""buying the dip""  buying the Dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling  off  when the price rises just as the current market is down. Holding is great, Although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market, All that changed when I encountered Thomas Wallace Howard Services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Expert Thomas that has made me over 15ʙᴛᴄ. This is his details on ᴛᴇʟᴇɢʀᴀᴍ ( @Thomaswallace15) for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related plans."

10541,"Crypto market is be coming more appealing to in vestors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, U.S investment bank noted that high volatility “acts as a headwind towards further adoption”. We’ve no doubt in mind that we are not only going bull with little signs of stopping. I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the amount of banks, institutions, and companies who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollaRs with the intent to hold long term: how can we refute that this may be the ""super cycle"" everyone is talking about? The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. I got this tips first hand from Raymond Anthony, He’s always a step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money.

10547,We already had doge but bought more today..Our whole family are making huge amounts of money with doge and after Elon Musk goes on SNL this week it will boom..we are holding because I believe dogecoin will be worth alot of money by the end of the year.

10549,Hi friends
10550,Hello any one there

10558,"Me and my brother put in $100 each at .40ish today, what should we do?"
10559,DogeCoin may be $ 3 before May 8. buy and Hold. Hold tight is a smart investor
10560,Only coin I would buy right now (And I own DOGE) is TeLCoin. It's been around a while. 3-4 yrs. The developers have been setting up the system and had no interest in pumping their crypto. They wanted the technology rollout to be perfect/really/the new big thing and it is.  It's one penny now but it'll be a buck in no time and much more. A lot of cake going to be made on this one like Pancake when i bought it around 29 cents.  GOOGLE IT. Thank me later.
10561,It's about 30c? Get with it man your a phoney with old videos saying they are out today🤥
10562,S  A  F  E  M  O  O  N
10563,Up by 400 today. Very excellent

Be carefull and stay hodling.
Doge can down in minute and up in a day or more."
10566,"Let's be completely real; people have been holding GME since the beginning of the year and the price, as of now, is still above $100 per share. DogeCoin is the next hold."
10567,Your future self will be happy . 📈🚀💪😃👍💶🏧

10569,I am about to sell my Tesla shares and get dogecoin.nah :-)
10570,"Fantastic Video ❤️ The trading system is a set of Trading Algorithms, instructions, and action of the trader, on the basis of the Technical analysis. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. In each trading system, the conditions for entry/exit, intervals, money management, and Risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making, as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character. it can be more obvious that trad!ing  is way more profitable than just holding as we  waiting for the price of the market to skyrocket. Doing Technical analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, they loose their investment. As an Investor, i have come to understand that you can make profit daily by involving in day trading your coins or copying trade alerts from a professional trader as i have been doing with Mr Bryson Davis for the past 7 weeks now and i have been able to turn my 0.9 btc to 6.7 btc which you all traders/investors will see that it is always profitable to day trade your coins rather Hodling. I will advice y'all traders/newbies to buy the dip now and day trade to make profit before the market Sky Rocket 🚀 Bryson Davis has 89% trades accuracy and is always able to give a helping hand to newbies. can be contacted via 𝚠нαтαѕαρρ +15162106420 and telegram @Bryson_signals"

10583,"I bought in Doge at $0.02 but sold off at $0.07 because I listened to a friend who adviced me not to keep it in, i immediately regretted it so I later bought in at $0.06 and holding long term like how I *originally* wanted to and now I'm happy but I STILL won't sell off even if it hits a whole dollar, lol."
10584,"At 80 percent profit right now, once it hits 48 cents i doubled my money. Thank you so much for informing me a while back 🔥💯"
10585,The fact that this guy would recommend to sell an appreciating asset (Doge coin) for a depreciating asset (fiat currency) should make you consider what he is actually trying to accomplish. My logical analysis is buy the appreciating asset and hold it until it is no longer appreciating.
10586,Dogecoin and #Elongate coin for charity and will be listed on Bitmart 🔥🚀
10587,Doge 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
10588,Mark Cuban went from being a man I didn’t like to a man that I love with ALL MY HEART. Thank you Mark Cuban. 🐕❤️🚀
10589,its Either DOGE or Nothing Dont waste time! 🚀🚀 #Tothemoon
10590,It is  actually Doggie coin since there is a doggie on the coin but it’s also The DOGE Coin( the King of coins) so whatever you call it is fine but it’s the people’s currency and the main weapon to defeat the enemy. You can do the math.
10591,Doggie coin is the DOGE of COINS it is and will remain the people’s currency. RECOGNIZE the revolution will be televised. Doggie coin is the peaceful revolution for humanity.

10603,HODLLLLLL
10604,15 days profits 60 K ... Doge to the moon
10605,"I had a lot of doge at the price of 0.027 and sold it, so pissed it’s on constant rise, could this shitcoin crash already so I can buy it lol"
10606,I invest on cryptocurrency. But I think this will go down as one of the biggest crashes in history. Every jerkoff is now getting into crypto. Reminds me of history about the 1920s of everyone getting into stocks.
10607,Better then a lottery ticket 🎟 🐕 all day everyday
10608,Investing successfully in forex requires the expertise of a professional broker that is why i have made profit since i started trading with Mrs Benjamin Addison she is the best.

10615,The USA will ban all cryptos EXCEPT FOR DOGECOIN !

10620,"I sold my doge on 1 may 
Should I buy now"
10621,"I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert  BRYAN WELSH, with is guide and signal service i ' ve made over 9B TC worth of crypto assets over sthingsome months.He can be reached on 🆆🅷🅰️🆃🆂🅰️🅿️🅿️  (+1 229 218 3126) or 🆃🅴🅻🅴🅶🆁🅰️🅼 (@welsh_trades) for related issues"

10636,I’m so glad there is a truth video about Dogecoin.   All these fiction videos don’t make me want to watch.
10637,"I hope I had bought more! Please guys, keep talking about doge and let's bring it to the moon. That's my last chance of making some money LoL"
10638,Plz go to $1 I will buy puts
10639,Can’t see why a big company would accept Dogecoin as currency when just about anyone could mine (print) it.
10640,Doge is going to pass a dollar this year
10641,Uncle Elon will be (CEO) of doge 😁
10642,Doge to the moon

10649,Could Koduro be the next safemoon? Brand new out and gaining a huge following. Its got to be worth a punt at the price it is at. You can obtain it through pancakeswap
10650,oh man....
10651,I know nothing about crypto currency. Where do I start??
10652,"There is a interesting individual, who can be googled as ""Walter Bulls strategy"". He made a fortune some years ago. Not long ago, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of professionals. This guy clearly demonstrates how to copy him automatically using such services. We must try while the market is on the rise."
10653,"Elon Musk, is bullshit. The bubble guy."
10654,Plot twist: Kevin was shorting Doge.
10655,Ok so bring the ceo of robinhood on heee again and be kind and sweet and agree with him again?
10656,"eff doge! Its dumb. Gamestop is dumb too. Elon doesn't even care about his own stock, why would he care about doge? Its just a joke to him."
10657,Try nominex. It took me seconds to buy and sell
10658,Doge went to 7 cents?  Where the hell is he seeing that?
10659,Yeah man you just lost a subscriber
10660,Aka penny stocks aka high risk
10661,"There is no such liquidity’s issue on the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges. I would guess that there servers are just overloaded, because I can swears you can fill a market order instantly on the right exchanges. I wouldn’t buy/sell crypto through weeble/Robinhood because they rely on this leader exchanges behind the scene.

About doge: one account own 28% of the supply and this account is definitively active, and withdraw around 2B last month (you can check the blockchain records :) )."
10662,Dudes drinkin lol
10663,SNL was the event and the news. Look at how much exposure it is getting. When in doubt zoom out. Dog to $5 by July.
10664,"I thought Elon did fine, we were pretty lucky he even mentioned it at all. The true problem was that robinhood owns 25% of all the doge coin available to trade. After the GameStop saga robinhood is trying to get some of their money back. It makes sense that they used that 25% to sell at the peak to make some of that money back. They can literally drop or pump the price for 25% of its CMV"
10665,dont listen to anyone not even Kevin! (no offense man :D) listen to yourself.
10666,Harmony looks like a very good project to talk about is made by one of the shift engineers from google maps and he has a very good team Very very Good crypto to look for ... technology and fast
10667,Lots of people are going to  get hurt when Doge crashes...Dont vote for this guy
10668,breh. too shiny. hurt eyes.
10669,That this guy has gone from real estate the most tangible asset in the world to this nonsense is a good statement on the bubble we are in ...kevinsanity
10670,Dogecoin going to $1+ 🚀
10671,Elon did great! N I thought it was really funny.
10672,Mad TV was always better than SNL and gas powered cars are more practical. (Clearly in my feelings)
10673,"I'm done with DOGE, ETH is where its at."
10674,Kevin talk about the AMC movement that’s going on right now
10675,"Future self tells past Kevin, HODL everything! The very next day Elon announces Doge-1 rocket to the moon being financed by $Dogecoin"
10676,Do you own any doge personally Kev??
10677,DOGE 💯📈🚀
10678,Yall mad at a coins price dropping as if its core value being based on one person is a good thing
10679,"Saying ""what's up with Doge"" is like saying what's up with the dice but you're playing with a 12 sided 🎲... And #SNL was funny as hell. For first time I'm a long time."
10680,Bonfire 🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
10681,Not even Elon could save that show. SNL is just terrible...
10682,currently market cap and potential of DOGE is set up to 10 dollars... its realistic that it can move up to 1 within this year.
10683,"If jokes on SNL are enough to cause your investment to lose its quarter of its value in a matter of minutes, maybe you're not in the best investment... just saying."
10684,"its not the day we think it is... snl is not a good catylist because its all SNLS FAULT... now SNL needs to be sued for causing harm to doge...  THats where the money is... or if we wait, DOGE is going up to 80 and also evenutally within this year to 1 dollar."
10685,Do any of you know any videos to recommend?  Been watching this jackass 3 months and he never made me any money.
10686,"Who cares, ETH just broke 4K"
10687,"Dduuddee. I doubt you’ll lose any followers by enjoying a weekend with your family. Time is the only thing you can’t get back. Also, we aren’t promised tomorrow so why not spend time with those you love?"
10688,"Ha, some are luvin the volatility created by the SNL tension- many bought at the dip last night and got some nice scalps."
10689,you watched snl?  on purpose?
10690,"Next DOGE 
$ BONFIRE . Buy it, before you missed the rocket, 2 days on coinmarket. Get in early and make $$$$$
🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
10691,"A scam was running on YouTube and Twitter before and at the same time as SNL. Just Google, SNL DOGE scam the word is a lot of people sold a lot of DOGE and lost a lot of money."
10692,Elan Musk bought the episode??
10693,"Get back to stimulus and pandemic 
I’m not interested if you Governor 
Or stocks
I’m going to unsubscribe soon"
10694,This my first time seeing kevin slapped 😂
10695,You cant actually own the crypto since you cane use a wallet feature to move your coins. I wouldn't recommend robin hood or webull for crypto.
10696,Why does it feel like everyone is always on the doom and gloom side of Dogecoin at every opportunity? The coin dropped to 14 cents and then shot up to an all time high of 70+ cents and now it's holding strong in the 50's. The thing is a beast and is doing incredible.
10697,$LXXGF is not a momentum stock but it will be.  You saw it here first.

That showed them how smart they are. You can also tell when I just bought some tech stocks because the Nasdaq will drop 1+% the next day."

10726,"I agree with your point of view.... But I like how it went. It holds him unaccountable for leading a novice astray. However, it created an opportunity to still buy low. So I think it played out well. But Thats just my 5c. Thanks for your streams. Good stuff."
10727,"He announced that space X is going to accept payments for lunar project on beginning of next year...  So I thing that's why he shouted ,, Dogecoin to the moon,, :)"

10729,Who would make an investment where the catalyst is a skit on SNL?
10730,Speaking of Enphase...we still need a fundamental analysis on Enphase!

10736,Leaning back further and further 🤣
10737,"I got errors on robin hood trying to buy, wanted to catch that falling knife and my order was not processed. Also Webull kept freezing on us."
10738,You know people are just going to buy the dip. The rally will continue until the hedge funds shut it down.
10739,When you start to think critically about currency not backed by a sovereign nation. It's starts to fall apart.
10740,"Maybe the horders of doge sold as Elon referred in February , the concentration on doge stock holders should sell ."
10741,"Kevin, put the camera down and be on vacation. (In my Lauren’s voice). 😆"

10755,Maintain 69. Got it. Thanks
10756,Hoping an auto makers ceo mentions a joke coin on a comedy show shouldn't be an investment strategy?

10767,Thanks Kevin. Fake Loser Kev don't bother spamming me.
10768,Sorry - I didn’t watch your whole video as I had to stop. Too painful. SNL was fabulous - I can’t help it if you don’t know for example the Chad character. I couldn’t breathe I was laughing so hard. You might want to watch “every chad ever” on YouTube. And weekend update about Doge was hilarious and people panicking over nothing is just sad. It’s a comedy show. Elon did a great job. It’s like when that Clayton Morris’s guy of Morning Invest went after Bill Maher - he knew absolutely nothing about the show and spread so much false information. I hope you all sell doge so I can buy more. As Elon said- to the moon!
10769,"Use sunscreen, safety first"
10770,Elon is the real deal !!! He is not an actor but a genius that can move an entire economy. He is not fake !!! Dogecoin to the moon !!! Let’s go !!!!
10771,I suspect Kevin doesn't watch SNL much.  The skits were about average compared to the rest of the shows.  Not too bad.
10772,All i have to say is that word of the people is the most powerful weapon ever. If you want to see dogecoin go to the moon. Simply keep it relevant.
10773,"I’ve made more money on Doge than any stock Kevin has suggested to buy.  Reading body language, Kevin looks away or looks down from the camera.  Very telling. I’m sure he wished he bought when it was 4 cents.  Unsubscribing from this channel.  So tired of him selling all his crap."
10774,People got scared last night. It'll go up again.
10775,"INVESTING IN SPACE
SpaceX accepts Dogecoin as payment to launch ‘DOGE-1 mission to the Moon’ next year
CNBC, Reuters...etc. have reported this. This news is also on the Twitter first page with 300k retweets. how do you see this? Thank you."
10776,"Doge is supposed to be a joke.  Elon knows this,  he'll pump doge, but he says buy xrp,  especially when he says much wow. 
Gematria,  look it up."
10777,You can’t judge crypto on one day performance
10778,Just wanted to say you absolutely nailed it with your predictions. Hope you and the kids are having a blast!
10779,"10,000 doge mined per minute, infinitely. that is all."
10780,"SNL hasn’t been funny in years, they have gotten worse. They don’t want laughs, they want applause."
10781,Doge got the love. Time in the market is better than timing the market. Remind me who said that
10782,"SNL is a skit show. You're disappointed as if SNL was meant to be a Doge documentary. Of course they're gonna make fun of it, doge holders should be happy if was mentioned at all"
10783,Right? And as if they didn't know how those scripts might affect outcomes.
10784,"it's all emotions, it's part of the game.Doge will not go away and long term we will do very well. I added at .42 so not bad at all. If you didn't sell below your buys you didn't lose."
10785,BUY THE RUMOR SELL THE NEWS.
10786,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI. His daily trade s!gnals has really helped me grow my !nvestment in the crypt0 m@rket and with the right mentorship and str@tegy, crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for newbies and lnvestor.

10787,Dogecoin? Plz. Rather try my luck at the track.
10788,"Not surprising you people falling for a 127,000,000,000 supply when billion dollar investment firms like Blackrock, JP Morgan, Fidelity, ARKK (Cathy Woods) and others aren't buying stupid crap like Doge but ether and bitcoin only. Lol The owners tells all on the investments as far as 10 year forward looking plans go."
10789,Kevin we saw the writing on the wall that a sell off was coming 😳😂🤣👀😐
10790,Kevin we love u bro!
10791,Seems most of you aren’t reading between the lines. I thought it was perfect. Best snl in awhile. I know that’s not saying much but it’s the establishment that ran out on it lol
10792,"wtf is this your stupid expectations of constant pumping, this is really ridiculous"
10793,SNL sucks
10794,SNL dont have good script from 20 years ago. WTF xD
10795,How can I make money from investments
10796,why are you guys still on Robinhood!? Leave that crap! AMC to the moon
10797,Kevin You’re looking quite nervous today 😬
10798,"Pretty green eyes, my friend you don’t get it. 🚀"
10799,Shiba coin is the way .. it’s the new dogecoin
10800,I was playing with $8.50 and that gives you 150 fractional shares of 0.000001 so it's kind of cool I was trading 0.0001500 shares or half like 0.0000750 or third like 0.0000500
10801,If your orders dont execute it's because other orders were placed before yours
10802,I don’t buy stocks on a crypto exchange so why would you buy crypto on a stock platform.  Crypto price are always different on different exchanges and DEX.   The price dipped because the run up in crypto is the pump....  Crypto traders knew it...  but I picked it up at .47....
10803,I think diamond hands would be holding short term dips for the longer rises
10804,People buy the dip and it's so volatile if you look at 1w 1M and 3M as time goes if price stays the same the percentage up or down goes up or down so if the first day continues to go down over time the current price can go down and stay the same if it goes up the price looks worse so I have been thinking 5 days ahead as the first day goes down it artificially looks better or if it goes up the price can go up invisibly
10805,"He just accepted payment for an entire lunar mission in dogecoins, if he wasnt the whale before, he surely is now"
10806,"We Got a Lucid Commercial, Thats positive"
10807,Wow woke comedy writers and staff didn't kill and a crypto hype date sells off. And Robinhood had issues AGAIN?
10808,Lol looks like we will need a video update Kevin! Dodge is back up and I know you heard the space X news lol!!
10809,I had huge problems with BTC orders not executing on Robin hood. If you go to messages and ask why they say there are only certain spots open and they go in order so other people put their order in first
10810,"You are wrong....!
Dogecoin is 4 ever!"
10811,SNL hasn't been relevant since Chris Farley was on the show.  And he's been dead for greater than twenty years...
10812,"Check 'wall street bets' on telegram, this is announce channel for the doge pumps. They have been making announcements from a long time, they message everyone that they will make huge pump on SNL event 8th of may. Channel have 420k members , Wall Street boys created great attention of people pump it and took the profits. They are playing like that from a long time making billions. They have another's channel with 1,5m members, they bamned me from convincing people to sell at 0,69$ when pump will happen. Any comments?"
10813,"You're all going to prison .
t. Insider"
10814,6:57 Wrong again. Tesla just announced it's accepting Dogecoin!
10815,"Do you even watch SNL??  It's a Skit !! So the messages that they are sending has always been reversed. Reverse Psychology. 

SNL has always made fun of the message that they're trying to send to you.
 
If they were straight up with the information, then you're better off watching the stupid news.

Watch while Doge gets pumped up. "" Not Squeeeeeezed out"""
10816,"4:30 WRONG! I already deleted 2 of my comments but I just can't. The Price of Dogecoin dropped BEFORE the show even got started! During the opening montage. It didn't get worse after or during that skit. I don't understand how something that happened AFTER could affect something that happened BEFORE! Unless traders are also Time Travelers? Most media outlets are getting it wrong but We were there. We were watching. That's NOT how it happened. If anything, the price recovered a little During the show and leading up to the skit at around. 55 cents. Regardless of how the media is trying to spin it, there wasn't a joke or a skit that caused the price drop. It was a calculation on the part of Whales to sell at .72 and more importantly... BEFORE Elon says anything and there's any time for anyone else to react. Just saying. (Otherwise, decent points.)"
10817,"Robinhood owns 28% of doge and they keep screwing over the people trying to sell at the peak so of course it's tanking. There's no evidence of this but some think that Citadel is pumping doge to make up the money for their shorts, which wouldn't surprise me but yeah. Get doge on anything but Robinhood! I think Gemini just got it"
10818,I feel like if Elon did something positive he would’ve easily been accused of market manipulation and doesn’t want to go down that route legally
10819,"Remember that SNL is a comedy show, Elon is not supposed to talk about it seriously. Personally, I think he did a great job and make a lot of people start researching about it after May 8th! Also, listen to the monologue, Elon and his mother talked about Elon created a video game about spaceship when he was 12 year-old, and he turned it into reality! Are they trying to imply that Elon will be able to turn Dogecoin into the major currency in the reality world? I believe that Elon will be able to do that."
10820,Kevin looks like he has heat exhaustion.
10821,Your awesome either way. Thanks for always taking care of us Kevin!
10822,Yea it went to a low of .40cents lol ; )
10823,It’s funny that they are having the same problem in the precious metals. Trying to get physical gold takes much longer than it normally takes.
10824,I hope you and the family are having fun!!
10825,What’s next for Doge is folks putting their money into ETC. ETC is coming for $1k this year! HODL! Diamond 💎 Hands 🙌
10826,"Kevin, we love you!! SpaceX is now saying they will take Doge coin..."
10827,this is why SAFEMOON is a better investment
10828,"SpaceX and Geometric Energy Corporation to launch DOGE - 1 to the MOON, paid with DOGE may be a good news :)"
10829,"If you're still up on DOGE move it to an actual investment coin. I cashed out a little profit last night and added it to my #TRON, #XRP, and #THETA coins. They are alt-coins with utilities."
10830,It's pushing 60c again.
10831,"SNL reminds me Tesla battery day Tesla dropped so heavy almost catastrophic drop 
I remember very shy Musk explained about new battery technology Why he is so shy when he is speaking in public ?!

In my opinion Mark Cubain is much better catalyst then Musk’s tweets"
10832,"Doge is a joke bro, the most we hoped for was it being mentioned not being pumped. A joke is better than nothing"
10833,whos dumb enough to still be using robinhood. you don't even have real ownership of your crypto on robinhood. get smarter guys
10834,https://youtu.be/6ElSWk54c-Y
10835,Too many commercials
10836,"Doge is the closest thing to a global fiat currency on the crypto side.  It’s value is whatever the market thinks it is.  It is backed by nothing more than itself.  Just like every currency.  People say those currency is backed by the country’s “output”, but that output is measured in the currency based on it.  Doge
Is the same way.  Producing it is the output.  The fact that it can readily be printed has not stopped fiat, so Doge has a place as more entities accept it.  The difference here is that the miners get the proceeds from mining it as opposed to the country when it sells its currency."
10837,Guys if you really want to make money on this pump/dump just put some money in Shiba Inu and you gone make a good amount
10838,Kevin really shows his age whenever he mentions 1337 😅
10839,"I think you don’t see the point, best doge show ever."
10840,Doge is not valuable!  why do you want Elon to lie. A lot of people will lose all their savings because of this invaluable coin.
10841,"Your not supose to use centralized exchanges to buy crypto. who point of crypto is to be decentralized.

Use defi or binance on defi"
10842,"doge is going to the moon, literally.. not even a question anymore (doge-1) google it"
10843,you think Doge is worth the price?
10844,Can you have weebl and Robinhood at the same time?
10845,This video was very interesting! If it wasn’t with the help of Mrs.Florence Gregory who knows how i would have survived the pandemic. she helped manage my assets by putting me on the right platform
10846,Doge coin  has made 50k millionaires and 1000 millions  bag holders so far
10847,https://youtu.be/Hr-G8YEWHn4
10848,i yolod all my money lost 30% of my 20k...yikes. expensive episode...ill recover i make about 500 a week so it'll only take me 2 ;months to get that back..its hard work ya know..and not fulfillling but ya know..ya.
10849,Erotic videos with Kevin...
10850,SNL. Hard to watch. Uncomfortable!
10851,"This is clearly part of the bubble signal. When a completely useless coin's ""value"" depends on an unrelated person's ""performance"" on SNL.  SMH."
10852,SNL has not been good since the 70s. There goes an hour of my life that I will never get back. I was hoping that the shorts would eat dirt but as usual they won. It's all good. I'm still up and Good luck to all.
10853,Doge is a joke.  Always has been.  You guys didnt know that?
10854,And then space x accepts doge....
10855,"tbh I'm very happy that people that got rolled in doge learned their lessons :)... don't buy meme things GME or Doge, yes you can make ALOT of money but there is insane risk of loosing it aswell. And a little advice use Binance :)"
10856,"Kevin, this was NOTHING more than the typical ‘Buy the rumor, sell the news’.  Start thinking of alt coins as stocks and you’ll see the same patterns.  IMO."
10857,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" #shibainu token ! #NFTArt token ! #ElonGate Token ! Check it out ! to the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑🌑"
10858,"I just going to hold on to the 1,837 doge I have, I may buy it while its so cheap in the mean time. At least that way when it dose go up I have more to sell. I hoping it gets to 60-70. I say that because  I rather take my chances in that way then cutting my losses and getting out now.  just got to have faith the funny thing is, I told my self I sell just before the show came on and it was like 0.71 by then but I hesitated. next thing you know it drops like a rock.  I should have just stick to that ops.  I do feel confident that we will get more hype to spike it up again sooner or later just have to keep a eye on this dog man."
10859,Doge Bouncing back.. SpaceX gonna be using it as payment
10860,"Yeah I got hosed where it would not let me sell, then it would only let me buy... wtf. It's entrapment!"
10861,Elon said it himself that it’s just a hustle.   But I have to admit when I had it at three cents and sold it because I was sooooo careful.  Dumb!   🤣.  Even when it was seven cents I thought that was getting high and a risk.   Now?   🤷🏻‍♀️
10862,The entire show was even more disgusting than I thought it would be. It was just free advertising for all of Musk’s businesses and shame on NBC for doing it. I hope this appearance negatively impacts his businesses. It’s time to stop worshipping this ego maniac. He only cares about his businesses. Investors are merely useful idiots to him.
10863,"Can't trust mainstream media to promote crypto. 
To the media crypto= China. 
Media doesn't like China that much."
10864,Set up..
10865,"buy rumor sell news, it's been proven over and over with Doge lol. you think people would catch on by now."
10866,"Thanks so much, Elon Duch, just outted himself. SOLAR WIND is radiation that kills DNA at 400 miles in altitude. Moon walk never happened, but in a movie set. No tech writers explained how space suites were self contained units. And how the moon cars were mounted on LEM. Musk is a space fraud."
10867,I swear someone is either paying him off or his personal investments are threatened by doge.
10868,"have you all forgotten about Litecoin cash it will take nothing to get this coin to a dollar and it only a few cents now.  Do the math total supply is 722,343,700 and a market cap of 20 million.  This is a no-brainer plus the branding of litecoin its self."
10869,"But on Robinhood, I was also unable to place a Market Buy last night (not limit buy)."
10870,There is a spread on ETC between RH and Coinbase... it’s not just Doge
10871,Elon played whoever sold. We going to the moon on Doge 1 payed entirely by dogecoin:D

But that went over my head and I thought he was just trashing Doge coin with his hustle comment... but I was wrong. My apologies Elon Musk, I wasn’t aware of those cool secret hand codes... I kept my doge and bought more when it dropped. I guess the Doge coin holders are the hustlers. I still believe there should be a penalty for those who hold a huge percentage of Doge, to protect people and the future of this currency. Way to go Elon Musk! Let’s Gooooo 🚀🚀🚀"

10924,It's just selling the news haha our group speculated this last week. Run up until SNL and sell off
10925,When Doge was mentioned on SNL did it scare off people trying to short the market in fear that Doge would go up and stay up? It was mentioned in a comedy. That was the hope.

10953,"Some of the actors were given a safe space in case they didn't want to work with Elon. A lot of people consider him ""controversial"" 🙄"
10954,SNL SUCKED SO BAD IT CRASHED
10955,Kevin appreciate you and your hard work sir but could you please please invite jim Richards live on your show and interview him would be so grateful because you can ask tough questions and not afraid ware other sites are scared to ask questions like you do for guest on your site
10956,Buy the dip!
10957,"I'm glad your bringing up these issues, these glitches are very concerning and financially dangerous! I felt flashbacks from the AMC/GME phenomenon. Robinhood/Webull causing investor anxiety!!!"
10958,"Dude, doge is a trash coin. Stop hyping it. You're not this dumb, are you."
10959,"It’s nice to see you out of your box lol
Enjoy your time out of the basement, you so deserve it!"
10960,"Politely Disagree, the SNL skits were hilarious...had us all ROFLMAO. As we have learned from Cybertruck no publicity is bad publicity!"
10961,SNL sucks!
10962,Buy dip while you can
10963,Now hes a crypto analists?
10964,kevin kevin kevin.... go back and watch the trump appearance on snl.    theres ur answer. the liberals dont like elon.
10965,robinhood is a scam if your keep using it youll keep getting screwed over
10966,Doge IS a joke. Don’t understand the disappointment.
10967,SNL hasn't been funny in like 25 - 30 years.
10968,I thought you were suppose to be on vacation.
10969,DOGE-1 to the moon!
10970,Enjoy the vacation with your family Kevin!!!
10971,You're getting too serious about a meme currency.
10972,Look so young shaved
10973,It's called having fun bro. Don't take it so seriously.
10974,But Kevin doge is a damn joke... it has no value other than fools trying to get other fools to buy it... some others are good like Eth algo cardano etc...
10975,https://youtu.be/Hr-G8YEWHn4
10976,oh my goodness kevin… you might not understand that comedy…. or maybe you do and just want to spread FUD…..
10977,I think Elon screwed it up when he agreed that doge is a hustle....lame AF
10978,"Well havent cha heard?!? SHIBB is the next big squeeze, get in while it's  worth it or you'll get doged"
10979,kevin isnt this proof .... if one guy can make a comment  and people freak out ... lets be smart people ... Greed is not always good..buyer beware
10980,"I mean the coin description literally said its a ""meme"" and a ""joke""?? Not to mention Elon mentioning its just a ""hustle"" was worse lol."
10981,"Crypto will be much advisable to invest on now,I have a personal broker who will help you trade"
10982,Rip pro the doge
10983,"Kevin would be the guy to update us on doge while on vacation, enjoy the vacation Kevin, you deserve a break!"
10984,Defetinely pre made scripts
10985,The general public is rude to say the least. I am losing faith in the human race. Keep up the good work Kevin
10986,At first I was like ... This sucks... Then it was like ok a little funny
10987,I think he meant to buy Dogecoin today on Mother's Day it would be on sale
10988,"The WORST thing Elon said at the end of SNL... ""Doge is just a hustle"" Fuuk"
10989,"Kevin, thoughts on the doge shiba showing up on the amazon app??  Search ‘amazon day’ on the app and check it out dog🐈"
10990,Let’s get this ETH
10991,Can you cover Cardano?
10992,gemini doge staking is the additional good news
10993,"Nono, I was unable to buy any Doge during the SNL skit (towards the middle)"
10994,support level 69 - i support this
10995,😂😂😂😵
10996,whenever dates are proposed then the big players come out and short it. We need to lose the dates.
10997,Your probably one of the douch bags that sold.
10998,Elon warned investors the day before .....
10999,"RH lost 4 million accounts due to GME in January, and now they are promoting DOGE but have 'technical issues' every time theres significant hype? How are people still confused? Robinhood is manipulating people. Notice also that the majority of RH, WeBull, and eToro income comes from Citadel."
11000,"Why use robinhood?
They seem like dodgy scammers to me..."
11001,"I read a story at like 1am this morning saying they did the news skit and basically told everyone doge was a grift.
then i looked at the charts and saw it dipped right at like 10:30 pm"
11002,Barry Silbert shorted it and tweeted about it its his fault. If it hadnt already dipped then the dip from snl might not have been so bad and paper hands wouldnt have got so scared...
11003,Lol I bought in at .08 cents so I'm still gucci
11004,buy the rumour sell the news. I was saying it to myself in my head for the whole week. Pity I fell asleep 2 hours before snl and my sell order at 72cents somehow didnt get filled....
11005,i rather watch puppets doing the skits
11006,Thumbnail beard to no beard whyyyy lol
11007,Where is Kevin who is this guy😶
11008,1 Doge = 1 doge lol it can fall to a penny and I would still drop a few grand lol the golden days 😎
11009,THE FUXKING ADS GODDAMMIT!!!!! 😤👎🏿
11010,"I admire the efforts you put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it is not too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Laurent Sebastien , with his guide and signal service i ' ve made over 9B TC worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues connect Laurent   on te_leg_ram @ { LaurentTrade} insights."
11011,Only thing that shined was the Lucid Air commercial.
11012,"Economics, rocket science, electric vehicles with comedy will never mix."
11013,I sold a large chunk of my Doge at $0.70. Left about 500 coin in play to see where it goes since it's paid for by the casino.
11014,"Elon did pretty good for a non-performer, but ya, you could tell that some cast members mailed it in."
11015,The skits were hilarious and doge ain't worth shit anws
11016,30 seconds into the video there are Ads.. now that is the real disappointment
11017,SNL is a satire show so negativity is expected we shouldn't take it so seriously DOGE will continue to rise 🚀
11018,I love Kevin! He so damn smart!
11019,"on vacation and yet you're still updating everyone. You my dude, are one hard working hombre"
11020,People are silly selling GEVO. Three major GEVO investors are on Biden’s cabinet. GEVO will pump again
11021,😂
11022,Welcome your communist tech overlords you poor millennials
11023,Meet Kevin. You don’t think the biggest wallets are selling webull and robinhood were selling it off!!!  If all of us did they couldn’t sell. We don’t own them they do.
11024,"Seriously?! 3 ads in less than 8 min? Not cool man, not cool at all"
11025,Doge deserves to goto 0
11026,Doge is a joke and you’re only playing who’s the greater fool.
11027,"Buy the Rumor and Sell the News, all Crypto OGs knew to sell before the event. Crypto isn’t like stocks and when your hoping for something to happen it almost always doesn’t and dumps."
11028,"i think you missed something big here mate. there is a huge crypto fund shorting doge and thats the reason for it falling. there isnt retail people selling. they are actually buying to fight it, and they will lose their money like they did with GME.."
11029,If you link the destiny of your money to a joke or a twitt you don't deserve that money.
11030,Kevin tf enjoy your vacation
11031,Doge is meme coin thats it. People are trading it buy the rumor sell the news. There will be a good amount bag holding.
11032,Thank you for your updates. Even when your on vacation.  Awesome job. You'll make a wonderful governor. Wish you were running in Georgia
11033,Man.. shut the fuck up
11034,It took me a fucking hour to sell
11035,"Everyone misses the point. SNL equated fiat as being backed by gold, which it’s not. Many people still believe this, and I wish Elon would have made one comment about it."
11036,Have a fun vacation !!!
11037,"What's better? Give your mom $ 0.50, $ 1 or $ 5. We have to wait until May 26."
11038,DOGE is a joke. It's always been a joke. Why is it even at .40? It's all chasing. Of course this was going to happen and going back under .10. It shouldn't even be at .01
11039,Sell the news 📰🔻
11040,It’s a hustle. You’re buying nothing.
11041,Brother look into xrp before is too late !!!
11042,SNL needs a reboot 🤔
11043,Doge is a pump and dump
11044,420 day taught us there would be a sell off the day.  Sell the news
11045,"Typical buy the rumor and sell the news in Dogecoin, Dogecoin was way overhyped going into SNL show, normal to sell off after, new traders need to learn this happens all the time"
11046,Very good analysis.
11047,I hate to say it but I agree 100% - fundamentally driven (vs) hype/media driven .. great analysis.
11048,"If someone has long term outlook you will buy on the big dip just like how Kevin has taught this group regarding stocks that you believe in.  Doge is no different.  Cryptos has always been volatile.  The key is for Dogecoin to be accepted by major retailer like an Amazon, Target, etc...If this happens it will go beyond $1."
11049,"Binance.US is better
Fulfill orders is instantly"
11050,"Was this doge dump not expected? Like everything, buys the news and sell the event."
11051,"We need to rebrand Doge AWAY from this effing dog🐶, it is NOT good for the brand."
11052,How dare you tease me.... I clicked on a bearded Kevin thumbnail and got a shaved Kevin! Lol
11053,the whales will not let doge go to a dollar so fast. they are in controle.  next time .80 then crash to .50      they will keep making money on every ride.   probably the best ratings for snl in 10 years.    snl sucks.
11054,"Crypto isnt stock, you are being played. Doge is a shit coin. Fomo is real. Elon is a bitch and there is no real use for doge."
11055,"get into a coin ""VET"" with actual value and partners. DHL BMW Renault Walmart China Louis Vuitton and many many moreand only at 20c. Go google Vechain partners and see for yourself"
11056,Pig token the new hype...!
11057,"Safemoon, Saturna and Bonfire! 🔥🔥🔥"
11058,I thought the scripts were funny but they were definitely making fun of Doge.
11059,Is okey DOGECOIN will go to the moooon 🤑🤑🤑🍾
11060,I been telling people this wasn't going to be good for doge. 🤷🏽‍♂️
11061,Most speculative plays have double heads. This will be no different.
11062,Disagree. Loved the content
11063,people literally talking about how someone going snl and skits didn't create a pump. just insanity.
11064,"Can someone please help? I bought Dogecoin on Simplex and got a code as ""destination cryptocurrency wallet address"", but I have no idea where/how to put that code to get my Dogecoins."
11065,The entire Doge phenomenon was Elon testing his tweet power. Nothing more. It's over now.
11066,I thought it was hilarious!!! But I was also high af
11067,"No, it got the love it's supposed to get... none... that how much people should give it. No idea why people are investing in a ""coin"" offering that is fueled by NOTHING but hype. GL to you all that invest in it and my heart goes to those that will lose most of their investment."
11068,"Kevin if anyone you should not be even speaking on dogecoin.

Let's get coins that have real futures and features for real world benefits.

Telcoin."
11069,investors are bailing out of DOGE and buying ADA
11070,"... well, if the Doge is any good, then there is a nice dip to buy."
11071,"We knew this will happen!!! 
I sold on Friday!!!!"
11072,Buy the dip. I just finished buying 1000 more tokens. Now holding 12k  tokens. Ill probably stop around 25k then just hold and wait wait.
11073,Looooooooooooool
11074,"Dog-E-coin is just a pump and dump...if you don't know by now. Crypto savvy people draw in a bunch of suckers and then steal their money. So if the plan to pump the coin to over a dollar and then dump it for a profit doesn't work, great. The more I learn about crypto-savvy people from way back when, the more I see just a bunch of greedy evil fktards preying on the desperate."
11075,"I made enough money on Doge to seed plenty of Wall Street stocks. I did my DD knowing that I might lose it all. Then I held onto the credo of ""Buy the rumor. Sell the news."" 
Before the show started, I could feel the uneasiness that it was mirroring the 420 (April 20th) hype. 
It was right for Elon to voice concern well before the show to not YOLO one's savings into such investments."
11076,Elon acted like a DOGEBAG
11077,Did Kevin sell his Doge?
11078,"Satoshi 
Nakamoto 
Live"
11079,Y'all don't believe. I'm holding.
11080,"Robinhood is trash. 
Get off Robinhood."
11081,"Wait, Kevin is hiring vloggers who need to have covid vaccination, but he’s going to Disneyland. 🤦‍♂️"
11082,He didn’t have to say anything at all. Also Robinhood fucked everyone for not letting people sell nor buy same as Webull that whole show. Why aren’t you talking about that? Also the whales who sold millions and millions during snl hmm
11083,I thought that Elon was pretty funny last night.... I guess I’m in the minority?
11084,The “difficulty” is them doing it all on purpose. No coincidence
11085,"I'm concerned... that anyone (including you, Kev) is taking a meme crypto seriously... and trying to build some sort of whacky investment thesis on it. Wtf indeed."
11086,Elon Musk screwed the people so screw him and #fu@!Tesla #fu@!elonmusk
11087,Dude goes on vacation says he will gone all weekend. First day at Disney- Hey Guys coming to you from Disneyland.
11088,"Two post in support of @realmeetkevin and Twitter flags my account as spam. My Twitter account is 4 years old with hundreds, maybe thousands of post and comments."
11089,The future for doge.....is sell it and buy your self a crypto that actually has a use case.... do yourself a favor  people and get into defi
11090,It’s because of people like you Doge isn’t on the moon yet! Just HODL or Buy! Stop selling and buying!!!
11091,Hey govner' Doge is a fucking joke!
11092,Am I the only one who thinks that Elon tanks a stock only to buy more cheap.
11093,Reverse pump and dump by musk possibly? Can we see if he has bought any?
11094,Buy the dip
11095,Doge is a joke
11096,Buy low. That’s all
11097,Doge coin flop
11098,I’ve never seen a drunk Kevin before. Interesting.
11099,Robinhood sucks. Use Voyager for crypto
11100,"When he said it was just a hustle, that's the part that hurt Doge the most... But that goes for all the cryptos. It's going to be fine, everything's going to be fine..."
11101,"All great things are a joke to snl: America, Trump, Musk, Dogecoin"
11102,a flop now I'm mad
11103,Sounds like Kevin is disappointed that Elon Didn’t pump a joke cryptocurrency with no intended or future use case or supply cap
11104,On a side note.  I tuned into SNL last night in a very long time and was reminded why I stop watching it.  It isn’t funny like the 90s to early 2000s.  Anyway the direction dogecoin took is interesting.
11105,*** Low of 0.40
11106,Why would you hold crypto on Robinhood? Can someone explain this nonsense to me?
11107,The point wasn’t $1 ... the point was to get more eyes and minds on dogecoin and crypto currency ... it will be the currency of earth or Mars
11108,"“Buy the rumor, sell the news.” retail attempted to pump it while the hedge fund frat boys dumped it on everyone’s lap. If you are using robinhood to trade crypto then you need to really re-think your commitment to the crypto market. KuCoin, Coinbase pro, Binance allow you to truly own crypto. Robinhood is for people who are just trying to make a quick buck by flipping crypto back to USD. USD is on the decline while crypto is on the rise. So you are selling something that’s more valuable to accumulate something that is becoming less valuable. Really Boggles my mind how some people are so blind."
11109,I liked the Show I think your take on the show was off... Robinhood definitely fishy though
11110,Doge is a great memecoin
11111,Thats why you dont buy an asset with an intrinsic value of $0
11112,"Don't be scared, be patient and hold! #dogecoin"
11113,"The sell off started before SNL started, It was down 0.15 before the programing started. I did notice Robinhood was acting weird, very slow"
11114,ive read articles that say coinbase is insured. but that both blockfi and coinbase cold store your crypto. and blockfi gives you the incentive of interest but coinbase is starting back log to also give interest for holding your crypto with them. im interested in getting into crypto but i want to have it in the best location. coinbase is the broker that im leaning towards however im unsure if ive over looked anything with these two or if ive overlooked another promising broker. looking for input. please and thank you.
11115,Those skits were horrible.  Although SNL has been bad in general.  Damn paper hands were like nope...I'm taking my gains now! #dogewillbounceback #stilltothemoon
11116,"Thank you Kevin , Robinhood wouldn’t let me sell at all and when it actually went through 20 mins later I lost so much ."
11117,Stop working on vacation!
11118,I think u (and many folks) went in with too high expectations lol
11119,Enjoy your trip Kev!
11120,l
11121,They weren't preventing only selling. I couldn't buy on the initial drop when it was under .50
11122,2:50 I had the same thing on Webull but this was  a week ago. That buy order never filled it is still up right. But the other 2 I put in filled 45 mins and 37 mins after
11123,"A meme joke coin, going down with negative joke not a surprise."
11124,elon just left us... we're on our own dogecoin never dies
11125,They need better writers. They made Elon look like Barney.
11126,I'll stick with BitCoin and Ethereum 😆
11127,You don't know anything about Dogecoin. You just want the views. Bye.
11128,"SNL is a bunch of cowards now, you see it in the topics and scripts. They make the easy jokes about people like Trump and these old “safe” topics .

Real comedy doesn’t need to be massively offensive but it’s a necessary by product from pushing the limits which they’re no longer doing."
11129,Elon Musk has a disability
11130,"Doge is a joke of a coin, why does anyone get upset when it falls because of a damn comedy show? haha its a bit ironic."
11131,It was pure jokes like Doge was originally intended to be.  Doge will live on and speculators will continue to pile in until it dumps to .002 and remain an internet tipping meme coin.
11132,The pump happened before air. Everyone anticipated a jump and bought early.
11133,Hold the line people 🚀🙌🏻 1$. In 3 months
11134,Heh you already shaved - lol         Good time to buy -  now we  know
11135,Love? Elon outright called Doge “a hustle.”
11136,"Doge was literally created as a joke!!!!! Why are people not understanding this??? Doge has no future! 10 million Doge are created EVERY DAY! thats like the fed creating 100 billion every day since creation!  it has no future, no plan, no nothing.  it is called a MEME coin for a reason.   There are only 3 crypto's that have more ""circulating supply"" than doge.... come on.  This is almost as bad as pushing or recommending bitconnect"
11137,SNL is the garbage of trash
11138,"Wow, those of you who are using stock exchanges to buy crypto are fucking idiots. Use Crypto exchanges! Trade 24/7"
11139,Are you drunk in this vid?
11140,"Y'all be hating. I thought Elon did a great job. Most of the skits were good except the doctor one. And who couldn't predict a Doge selloff during SNL. Not a surprise. I agree, Robinhood and Webull aren't helping the situation either. Rumor has it Robinhood owns a large percentage if Doge, so limiting selling wouldn't surprise me."
11141,"The DOGE network needs to confirm orders.  This process takes about 20 minutes to make confirmations on their network.  Nothing to do with those exchanges.  For example when I send my mined DOGE from my wallet to an exchange, it takes 20 minutes."
11142,"The scripts are never great and for snl it was ""funny"" meaning its never funny but some skits were decent. Snl sux"
11143,Are we all in agreement to not have anymore set pump date for Dogecoin.
11144,Does doge ever die? I think not
11145,DELEVERAGE
11146,"I don't know who needs to hear this but you gat to stop saving all your money, invest some if you want financial freedom ❤️. I placed my trade on Fred Green platform and it has been good returns"
11147,My thought is that Musk initially tweeted about doge as a joke and it took off. He is now trying to get out of the joke gone wrong without completely wrecking people
11148,This is the way..... trust the process. #DOGEARMY
11149,Looks like you're in the area . I recommend going to amorelias mexican cafe for breakfast
11150,Trade on binance wtf u guys doing
11151,You’re kind of annoying now .
11152,Change the name from Dogecoin German word for shower coin it's a wash out
11153,"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money"
11154,You people are missing the point doge was mention many times in one show that was broadcast to humongous audience give it a year or 2
11155,"UMMM, the dropped didnt happen because of SNL. This was Barry Silbert and his cronnies pulling out and openly qnd purposely telling everyone to drive the crypto down. First time I have seen Kevin not do due dilegence. Dissapointed."
11156,"Value of $1,000 invested 1 year ago: 

PIRATE CHAIN: $311,590
Dogecoin: $274,521
Ethereum: $17,186
Bitcoin: $5,872"
11157,"Check out bonfire token! up ALOT past days, it has a roadmap and are not a pump and dump coin! invest your money! you wont regret it🚀"
11158,"To be fair, doge had some correction last night but is still hodling strong. Last night made a believer in the community wanting it to go up. I still don't own any, but the doge community def changed my outlook on it"
11159,"I believe that you are  upset cause you don’t have enough doge,,, Cain of negative there buddy"
11160,Chad was hilarious
11161,Kevin you seem depressed about doge  coin . I hope you didn’t lose millions when you bought it in the 60s. Good luck . I hope you get your money back .
11162,Love your energy Kevin….💖……..your the Energzr Bunny of youtube….appreciate you!…….Enjoy a well deserved  vacation.🎉
11163,Guy is whing about first vacation on 15 months when his whole life is a vacation.  Try no vacation in years
11164,Makes a joke about a joke coin .. dont see anything wrong here .. doge coin doesnt have anything to do with Elon musk wtf. Its falling because the coin is a JOKE .. kevin your a clown. I used to like your material . Dogecoin hype ? Get real
11165,Lol u had a few drinks before this I'm guessing keep the videos comin
11166,People dumb enough to put their money into Dogecoin deserve to lose it all. Fools and their money are soon parted. Suckers!
11167,"Before SNl, I saw on Robinhood that dogecoin founder, Silber, has shorted it. I thought uh oh. SNL’s purpose was to sink the stock. I just can’t believe that Elon was a part of it"
11168,I’m just wrapping my head around this circus.  A SNL skit drives the movement of a trading security (or asset) by 40-50%.  Some joke?
11169,"Lol why is everyone so surprised, it was so obvious there would be a high potential people selling off for profit. Kevin is too experienced to not know this so I’m sure he saw it coming too. It’ll consolidate and doesn’t matter much if you’re willing to hold for more than a couple months. Most likely $1 in a month or two and the people who panic sold are be like wwhhhhaaaaaa"
11170,Hey nice shaved look
11171,considering robinhood holds over 25% of all dogecoin.... yeah... sounds about right.
11172,"Lol, sounds like you had a blast all day haha"
11173,Billions of dollars were pulled out.....and the market didnt drop below .40...and is holding at .50....use ur brain....the whales pulled out yet it's still holding at .50.....lol BUY IN MORE AND HOLD!
11174,Bitcoin sabotage
11175,If you don’t like buying dogecoin buy some bitcoin for 50k and watch it drop
11176,Gemini give interest yield on Dogecoin. It'll go UP for sure guys.
11177,CIA WROTE THE SCRIPT FOR TJE SHOW.
11178,But that is why Doge went down because rich people buy presents only if they are in sale !!!! I know riches mentality
11179,The gamblers got shaken lol
11180,Nah you don’t see it the way I do. This was great for dogecoin
11181,"Elon calling it a hustle, not great!"
11182,These newbie traders never learn to sell the fking news.
11183,Kevin are you placing limit orders or market orders? Shouldn’t a market order fill instantly regardless of price?
11184,I lost around a thousand dollars in 15 min because I couldn’t get my order fulfilled. It was profit that I lost but cmon. Same thing lol. Once you see profits it’s the same as your money lol. It’s ridiculous
11185,I dont know I thouhgt it was fine. If yall want off the rocket I'll buy your tickets from you
11186,Make a video about SHIBA INU
11187,Drunk Kevin is pretty funny.
11188,"Bought doge at 0.05$ and sold at 0.73$ , 15k$ made with a meme , thank you doge"
11189,Awesome Kev!! Thanks for the update 😄👍🏼👍🏼... great to see you in a more chilled setting...  out and about 👌
11190,Is it time to short sell?
11191,Kevin tipsy and on vacation and still at work. I don't think he knows how to stop lol
11192,Is there a better no fee place to buy crypto than coinbase
11193,The video was definitely made under the influence. Lol
11194,Remember that time Wealthfront was touted on this channel...
11195,I need doge back to .70. Then I can sell and buy more Etherium. 💪
11196,Yeah see I said all this. So many ppl are like OMG IT WAS SO GOOD FOR DOGE....and im like NAH IT WASNT
11197,Right like he made Doge look bad right??
11198,"It is a joke, I’m happy I’m in a crypto coin ADA"
11199,You wanted sale after make money that is the reason helloo use videos to send a stock to thr moon or to crash
11200,Doge was already selling off before the show...
11201,"Calling Dog-e coin....""doje'"" coin is like Joe Dirt calling himself Joe ""Dirt'e"
11202,"Same thing happened at the last hype, it will take few days to a week consolidating around 0.40-45 and go up to .80-90 or of course the $-"
11203,Some ones drunk 🍻
11204,"When has SNL (with original cast, not w/ Baldwin) had a good script in the past 5 years?"
11205,Vacation??
11206,We expected alot from elon and he was doing freakin drama on a show when he knows people expectation still he did'nt said anything great stupid elon
11207,this was all a comedy. Who was expecting to make millions is just a fool. Congrats to who made profit and walked away.
11208,Is Covid over in the USA?
11209,Buy the rumor sell it the news.
11210,Twitter Wario means up&down. so Hold!!
11211,"*Did Elon Abandon Doge?*
*m..aybe...Doge doesn't die..*"
11212,Why is he wearing a jacket in California? Its pretty warm there.
11213,Get vechain bro
11214,Are there market makers for crypto or is it just the brokerages responsibility to protect customers by not executing orders at fire sale prices
11215,Doge is shit people....always has been always will be.....invest in fundamentals not memes.
11216,However RLC had a major run up on CB sense its debute Thursday
11217,"""The scripts weren't that great..."" That's putting it kindly, and you just described SNL for the last 20 years."
11218,Thumbnail misleading 😤
11219,"Still holding though! Its gonna keep rising it's a short correction 
$1 is way possible, look @ all these no name coins in the dollar range"
11220,I knew it etc classic on roobinhood is up more then on other sites ppl buying at a over price😯
11221,Buy the rumor sell the news
11222,Stop buying jokes and speculative bs.... you guys are going to continue to get wrecked.
11223,THANK YOU KEVIN FOR YOUR HONEST AND FAIR EVALUATION - C.R.
11224,do you watch SNL usually?
11225,"Kevin! You are talking from the perspective of your own selfish interest. 

Elon did not go to SNL to make or break doge! 

He went there for the ""first principles"" of entertainment.

Put up your greed for once, bro! Elon doesn't owe you anything and doesn't exist to make you money. Jeez!"
11226,The real news to be is that SNL is still being made.
11227,if your in it to get rich right away then you shouldn’t be in this you gotta be in it for the long run he will make Doge strong for investors who stay strong
11228,I don’t know why Snl was so unfunny last night. They had millions of people watching with anticipation and then delivered an awful show
11229,"Buy the hype, sell the news.

Of course Doge was the butt of a joke, on a bad comedy show.  Who didn't see that coming?"
11230,Still more stable then the bolivar.
11231,"Can we now acknowledge all this stuff is insanity and trying to ""analyze this ""market"""
11232,Skits weren’t all that bad Hahha. He’s autistic so if he wasn’t comedian of the year then chill. The conversation should be. Why are people such paperhand pussies based on a SNL skit 😂  not to mention you saying Robinhood and all this retail trash hahah. Ppl learn how to buy actual crypto. Not this IOU bull shit from retail investor apps 🤷‍♂️ NFA hahaha but recall the purpose of crypto. To decentralize. Giving an exchange your social security and ID is NOT private or centralized. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NEW FOUND INTEREST IN CRYPTO AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE ROOTS !! Bitcoin is totally traceable for example. Not the point
11233,I mean.. Instead of looking at it like something bad. Look at the run it had! Millions were made. I'm sad I missed it
11234,Buy GME
11235,10 ads for a 10 min video. Nice.
11236,"Buy red sell green.
This is the opportunity for the idiots that bought green to actually make some money. 
But they're idiots so they probably sold at $.50 instead of DCA down the slope lmfao.."
11237,Why did anyone think Elon would drop ground shaking news on a comedy sketch show?
11238,"Gemini allows you to buy and sell instantaneously even during the most congested moments using the Market option.

Can be a double edged sword though cause Ive hit that button to buy and just watched the price dropped as I did."
11239,"I was pissed on friday because I couldnt get money to buy DOGE, but now I'm happy because it dropped to $0.4 and I will be able to buy more on monday. My last investment was when DOGE was costing $0.24."
11240,Doge hit 40c
11241,God dam paper handed weenie babies
11242,Holy advertisements kevin.... did you lose millions on doge and you’re trying to make it back on this video alone?! 6 ads for a 15 minute video?! Sheeeeeeesh
11243,"Kevin, RH has always been preventing people buying or selling Doge during the past few runs we saw. I've lost so much money because of it. It's really frustrating"
11244,Amc going to moon 🌙 💎🦍💎🦍💎🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
11245,Amc to moon 🌙 get in people 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿✅
11246,Wife works on on the network and this was recorded Friday. 🤣
11247,"Even though I think that Dogecoin shouldn’t be influenced by well known person, Elon Musk really ruined it. 🤯😩"
11248,"It was the best for the joke doge is, not more not less than it deserves."
11249,I didn't watch because SNL hasn't been funny for years and Elon does not come across as a funny guy.
11250,"Most of the cast sat out because they were triggered by the big bad capitalist CEO. In fact, Lorne Michaels put out a statement about it."
11251,"There was a news article that said the actors could sit out since Elon is so controversial. Some actors don't like him as a person. Probably has stance on covid not being a big deal they even had a skit about him being wrong about masks. But that'll change. He will come out and reinstate his stance. I tried to sell last night and couldn't. My uphold app was frozen, it couldn't even load and show me the gui. Sad night for crypto. Stupid Elon tanked and took doge down. Knew I should of sold before."
11252,Doge is trash.
11253,Fucking love you Kevin
11254,Doge is a joke lol sell while you can and buy a coin with utility.
11255,"It is definitely time to stop relying on the tweets of a few people to push the price of Dogecoin. If it is to succeed it needs to succeed on its own merits. If you want it to succeed, reach out to businesses and push for them to accept it. Reach out to service companies like Robinhood etc. and push for them to develop functional wallets. Don't want it to be a hustle? Help put some meat on its bones and make it not a hustle."
11256,Snl sucked big time it was not funny at all.epic fail to have his mom say she didn’t want Doge and then do the doge father skit in the middle of snl after most of the sell off. Wth 🤦🏻‍♀️ Elon did it again
11257,Fuck all these amateurs who sell their shares are the slightest sign of it not climbing. Crypto would be so much stronger if retards who don’t know the first thing about investing would just leave it alone
11258,I thought Elon was funny :)
11259,Instead it dropped to .50 cents
11260,Was done purposely..BS
11261,I waited about an hour for one of my orders to sell
11262,"Who cares doge coin didn’t go to the moon. Elon fucking Musk hosted SNL, and I found it quite funny."
11263,Someone hit the buy button at the exact moment someone hit the sell button on peak. I’m sorry/congratulations.
11264,No.. had nothing to do with snl. If you look at the daily chart. That was expected.
11265,Musk just playing with people getting them to jump in whiles he sells
11266,Kevin still works on Vacation... Meetkevin for governor
11267,Can you do a video on Bonfire and Saturna they look huge 🚀💥
11268,Please slow down with the ads every few seconds
11269,workaholic
11270,"If you trade Doge, kudos to you, hope you made money.. But those of you who are holding Doge.. look at its previous history.. Its all pump and dump! The coin has no fundamentals, no development, and horrible coin distribution. Oh well. Hope yall didnt get hit so hard."
11271,Workaholic 😂
11272,This the first time I felt like saying stfu Kev lol but I bought in at 4 cent I’m up 800% I can’t complain if I’m at 50 cent I’m looking good it goes up to 72 cent that’s gravy on top
11273,Fuck Elon fucking musk
11274,"I don't know why you think diamind hands was easy for us? I bought at .06 with 125k coins and was -3,000 in January/ February and March. I held it and bought more on dips. I am 50k in profit. I am hodling until 2025.

New investors think spending $400 in dogecoin today and get rich next week. This will not going to happen. If you want to invest than you have to hold it long term."
11275,"This is the worst youtub channel ever, tons of advertisement and just blablabla"
11276,"Wait, Kevin’s been locked in his house for 12 months and the first place he goes when he’s out is Disneyland...?"
11277,This worlds a joke lol
11278,Kevin is the Man..have a good vacation buddy! Thanks.
11279,Ever heard of buy the rumor sell the news?
11280,"Man, for 1.6M followers, you really know nothing about crypto OR pop-culture. The skits seem scripted? Yeah. It's not called Saturday Night Improv. Actors opted out because of the harsh comments given to them by Elon. Your followers should take warning about your know-nothingness"
11281,People are stupid and get controlled by social media hype lmao
11282,Doge is a joke Kevin!!!
11283,🚀🚀 CAPTAIN COIN 🚀🚀
11284,Hey hey heeeeeey!!!   BITCONNEEEEEEECT!!!
11285,Hey hey heeeeeey!!!   BITCONNEEEEEEECT!!!
11286,I lost $2000 because of coward  investors
11287,"Tesla and Doge....two sides of the same coin. If you're in either, gtfo now."
11288,why does it look like your staying in your nans bedroom?
11289,Webull also had am issue with selling DOGE. I was pissed.
11290,"Buy pre hype, sell at peak hype."
11291,"Elon set up a project for his kids to mine dogecoin, he knows how this coin works.  He's just stating facts and not to be the one responsible for people's lost if they're greedy.  If you support Elon and doge, do the same, mine the doge and use it with a wallet, you're not gonna lose anything"
11292,⭐️A buttcoin like doge should be banned ✔️
11293,Now lets see that money go back into growth stocks.
11294,Been following you for over a year now. This video was one of your dumbest.
11295,Market is manipulated... And modern online trading is going to reveal an expose that truth.
11296,It was cringe 😬
11297,BUY! BUY! BUY!👀👀📉💰💰💵💵📥
11298,Elon was on the whales side and he kind of hinted at it before hand about being cautious. And then magically non of the broker sites worked during the sell off.
11299,Elon messed it up
11300,"""I'm taking a break this weekend"". next day new video is up xD"
11301,News flash: SNL is comedy. Not real news. Millennials are so confused they can't tell reality from fantasy.
11302,"Dogecoin being sabotaged 
https://youtu.be/_KDGaF34M6s"
11303,I’m still in the green with doge but SafeMoon is definitely sounding like a better crypto right now. 🚀
11304,I was prevented from selling
11305,Doge is pure speculation unlike bitcoin
11306,That is why I went to safemoon
11307,Kevin are you actually out having fun?!
11308,SNL not funny?? Say it aint so!
11309,Elon is a manufactured hero. The control structure cant let him fail.
11310,"Wait , you were disappointed with SNL’s scripts just yesterday? 😆 😂 😂"
11311,"Idiot. Doge is, and is supposed to be a joke. Are you f’ing serious?   Robinhood?   13 minutes of my life, gone.  Actually, 4 minutes, unwatchable crap."
11312,i don't get it dogecoin has no supply limit unlike bitcoin who are the morons that don't get this means it can't be used as value storage?
11313,Is Webull and Robin Hood owned by the same people
11314,I didn't watch  knew  it was  coming and the dump was  interesting 🤔
11315,You’re wrong but and hold.
11316,when that mother day joke about doge coin came out it dropped 5 cents. then dropped a penny every minute the show was on lol
11317,"Lol if Elon Musk can’t even make the price of Doge coin increase just by appearing on national television and talking about it then nothing will. 
Doge coin is a shit coin with no use and utility. Analysts warned everyone that it wouldn’t last long. It’s a fad and a lot of stupid people bought into it."
11318,Classic sell the news event. I have zero sympathy for anyone who lost money last night because this exactly happened on dogeday. You had a couple of weeks to buy cheap this snl was first announced. Hopefully many lost and decided to leave the market so we have less dumbass idiots with us
11319,"Doge nation it's time to support the Doge and punish SNL.  They should have done much better. I have not watch SNL for years.  The show was bad with bad acting and bad writing, not even Elon could save it....."
11320,"Doge is a joke, that's the point."
11321,That was embarrassing. Elon owes me money
11322,Robinhood is trash. It's not an accident it stopped working. Robinhood has screwed its users several times to protect its own interests and it will happen again.

11325,Ask Kevin needs to know you couldn`t buy Dogecoin last night either.
11326,Well he is now associated with people losing money. Thanks for killing doge Elon
11327,Kevin u drunk? Lol okkuuurrrrr
11328,Doge is not going to hit a $1.00 anytime soon once he called a hustle it went 📉📉📉📉📉📉
11329,Young man you're flushed . Haha love ya kevin
11330,Why the fk are people buying crypto on Robinhood & Webull ffs! 🤦‍♂️ 😂
11331,"Having googled 'copy Wallter Bulls"" you can find a cool persona. He made a fortune a few years ago. Recently, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of experts. This personage clearly shows how to copy him automatically using such services. We must try while the market is on the rise"
11332,"he is manipulating the market, wherever he wants he raises his fortune by saying few words.He is going to bring the price back, though is it really worth it?"
11333,"Ask Kevin is a first time watcher of SNL... They haven`t had a good skit since,,, actually the fact is they`ve NEVER had a good skit!"
11334,You look crazy w/out ur Beard
11335,The main reason for the crash -Barry Silbert and his minions.
11336,I'M NOT FREAKING SELLING
11337,I think it’s just a buy the rumor sell the news type of thing. Everyone recognizes Doge is a meme coin with really no purpose. They still buy it because it’s funny.
11338,"All of you DOGECOIN hodlers, take your money and put it into real projects guys, enough of this. Want to make gains with a real project? Buy Vechain, you can get 2 VET for your 1 Doge right now. Don’t give up just move into real projects with actual futures."
11339,"Please cashapp me so I can buy more lost my rent money,so stupid of me $Tashaunjosey"
11340,Damn 6 ads on 13 mins Video I guess doge hurt you
11341,I loved the skits
11342,Buy the dip and hold
11343,Same constipated face thumbnail for stupid doge coin and serious country and economic issues. You will never know when this channel has something important to say because the thumbnails are all equally fake concerning.
11344,Robinhood sux!
11345,You have dogde too? Oh man you are in every pos there is in financial markets
11346,I dont think many people are going to buy a Tesla now
11347,He called it a hustle Kevin!
11348,Dont forget the nose sunscreen
11349,Millenials are funny.I stay with index funds
11350,His enjoying this 😂
11351,But wait it dropped wayyyy before... SNL actually started... minutes before... one whale supposedly dropped millions and millions of coins
11352,Let’s all buy more doge to drive it up since snl was a let down!! 🚀
11353,"The Cardano train is leaving the station, see ya never Doge!"
11354,I buy Safemoon 🚀🚀🚀
11355,should i sell or hold i feel like doge aint goin nowhere
11356,Ditch DOGE and board the ADA train!
11357,I blame gen z hospital
11358,Okay great so will growth and small caps come back now? 😂
11359,Come on man you know the run up is always before the day of the event. And if you're still trading crypto on Robinhood then you gave the game away. I took my money out a long time ago (relatively).
11360,Who cares about doge buy safemoon and gmr financial
11361,"I mean we all love money, but for someone with few millions and cry over money makes me sick.  Make more kids and stop making videos.. Jesus your family needs you"
11362,"Weenie baby Kevin think he know everything, but that's how he be getting people money. Punk"
11363,"I want to see crypto offered on all online trading platforms. Especially the major’s. 
Unitl it’s offered on all platforms we will have a limited “market”."
11364,KEV drunky
11365,Hope you had fun at Disneyland Kevin!
11366,It was all hype it was bouned to happen. Same as 420. Doge will go back up. But this time slowly so it doesn't crash hard.
11367,I saw this shit coming. I sold the day before. I never trust planned rallies.
11368,Doge is a hype coin to distract the mass from the real coins
11369,Kevin get some sleep. Doge of course was going to sell off. Sell the news. Doge though sold and laughed at as a joke is no joke ;)
11370,"SNL is not a platform to pump Doge.  You’re taking it way too seriously and need to take a step back. If you’re disappointed by the sketches, it’s because comedy is hard.  Try writing one and you’ll see. Much harder if you’re trying to pump something without alienating the core SNL audience.  Take a deep breath and relax.  You’re on vacation!  😂

I actually thought he was gonna be way more awkward.  Good job Elon! 👍"
11371,If you purchase coin on Webull or Robinhood you do not own it. It is a mistake to purchase on these platforms.  Get a wallet and purchase through crypto exchange. This is the way. $DOGE $SafeMoon
11372,I disagree with your in SNL breakdown brotha
11373,"No, I was trying to buy at .47 an got the same error message for a long time, finally my order went through 30 min later. Everyone an their mother will be buying this low, it went back up to almost 60, just consider this a sale price lol"
11374,Kev is 🔨’d
11375,Bonfire 🔥
11376,How's your Disney shares? 🤔
11377,Enjoy the day off with the fam
11378,Gonna drop to 26c I have a limit buy set lol. That's where it started to get weird
11379,You’ve been praying for this which is the sad part
11380,My guess. Doge folk will sell off and move to Vechain (VET) next.
11381,Maybe something to do with sort-sellers dumping coins onto the market?
11382,"Go to Kraken, leave robinhood."
11383,"The skit was shit!!! Doge has had a parabolic run since the beginning of the year and it’s probably going to cool off for a while! Unless someone with enormous influence expresses a positive opinion about Doge, it’s going to take awhile to get to $1!"
11384,They didn't even show the shiba inu!
11385,"Last night was a shit show. The Doge jokes were lame, the whales started selling off, people began panic selling, Robinhood went down. Rollercoaster? Free falling from the top of the Empire State building sounds more accurate."
11386,Robinhood is PURE CRAP!!!!!  I sold Doge at over 60 cents and it filled at 47 pure crap!!!! I’m completely done with Robinhood Monday morning.  Selling all doge and moving to voyager transferring stocks to webul or think or swim
11387,Did I not warn you about this 48 hours ago?
11388,Doge family let’s stay strong we don’t need a shout out to touch a dollar
11389,Saw this coming a mile away. Same thing happened on Doge Day 420. Doge will be back!
11390,Doge SHOULD be the butt of the jokes.  It is a joke. It won't be around in a year IMO.  It will make a few people rich but offers nothing of substance.
11391,"Oh man for real... I've made a video (in Portuguese so don't need to see it ahahah) talking about this before the SNL. And for me the bulk of 'holders' would sell just before or during the show. 
It looks like it was that!
Great video!"
11392,I could see a lot of people that made some good profit in doge pull out and go into a BTC and Eth
11393,man put a million ads
11394,"Oh Man....On Vacation, getting offended by SNL writers before drifting off.  Just let go....Your family is far more important. SNL has not been funny for a Long Time."
11395,"Hi, I received an email last night for the targeted eidl and it’s giving me steps to complete. One is for irs to release tax info for 2019. Then there are others steps to complete, it says electronic disbursement but I can’t click on that yet I guess until they get the irs info. Can you please explain to me what’s going on? Thank you!"
11396,WRONG WRONG WRONG! THIS VIDEO SUCKS. IM UNSUBSCRIBING THIS DUDE
11397,🚀🚀🚀
11398,Doge is still going down be very careful Robin Hood is NOT allowing people to get out because no one‘s buying Thank me later SELL Now before it’s too late
11399,Doge 6 dollars on 2022 is time to buy more????????
11400,Doge is a joke.  Not a very funny one.  This will end badly with a lot of people losing significant money.
11401,Many of us called that! It was inevitable. If not for an early sell off but the script being from SNL was not going to be pro Doge. Lol Calling it a “hustle” hurt though. Ouch.
11402,"Sir, I would like to thank you 🙏 for taking the time to make this video. It will likely help millions with their anxiety."
11403,Why people still watch this woke SJW show is beyond me. The whole SNL bit was a massive catastrophe
11404,When you grow up you'll laugh about this night.
11405,🌿🌺🌿 Happy Mothers Day Moms!
11406,Fuck SNL I lost 20k man 🤦
11407,The “it’s a hustle” comment was ridiculous!! This was not anticipated do to the positive comments over the past months. Elon Bust screwed a bunch of people!!!!
11408,"doge is a scam i own it and i know that, i took the risk from .61"
11409,Shiba... coin?
11410,🤫move into $ada🤫
11411,Y’all act so surprised that it crashed lmao
11412,Sold my doge for Shiba (The dogecoin killer!)
11413,SNL hasn’t been that great in a long time
11414,I can’t understand why people are so precious about Doge? There are so many other coins that actually have a real use rather then a joke coin? Honestly Doge was never going to make a $1 this round. Was just a line to get people to hold so they can sell before the sell off.
11415,Dude Doge is a joke that has gone on longer than it should.  It doesn’t DO anything but have fans.  SNL was just holding up a mirror.
11416,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
11417,Get out of doge its a bs joke with no use case. If u made money you arena genius but its time to go with something with an amazing use case like vechain
11418,You are obviously not an engineer. The scripts were so funny and Elon was awesome.
11419,snl is completely stupid
11420,I don't think 69 is a real support level.
11421,Lol welcome to the real crypto world....whales determine the price not you
11422,"F*ck Webull, you need to start letting your audience know when trading crypto they screw their users by only filling orders way out of market prices. Buy orders are filled way above Ask price and Sell orders are filled way below Bid price. Its total Bull Sh*t. They should be called WeBullSh*T. Stick with Robinhood folks, only use Webull for the charting. Robinhood is not perfect but they don't screw with the prices like WebullSh*t does."
11423,I felt like Elon wasn't to bad but the regular ppl on SNL are pretty terrible it reminded me why I haven't watched the show in over 10 years
11424,Doge is a joke
11425,SNL is trash - I hope everyone woke up to that fact last night....
11426,"I've lost almost $1000 because of SNL, going to hang myself"
11427,Of course Robinhood blocked the sell of Doge when it wasdropping. Needs to be a lawsuit against robinhood
11428,"Musk will take Doge for Tesla but not until Berlin and Texas is online. Can’t keep up with demand now, so there’s zero need for him to pump demand by saying that."
11429,GameStop short squeezed twice.
11430,safemoon
11431,Buy BTT
11432,"First I thought Elon did a good job talking about Doge, then I rethink and I got piss with Elon saying Doge hussle..but I remember that he made a joke about himself and Tesla....SO “KEVIN TOILET  GOVERNOR...BS TO YOUR SIDE!!"
11433,"We are bleeding and in an emergency level, but dead. Doge will come back."
11434,Thats why l do not use robinhood.... lol
11435,Are you new??? Nothing pumps the day of an event....
11436,"Just like it was supposed to sky rocket on 4/20 , but it didn't. It will bounce back and continue to rise like it has been.  Just don't be like those sissy paper hand weaklings and hold on tight."
11437,"Trypical ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" It was just Doge day all over again"
11438,"Still have Rosetta API and Coinbase listing possibly coming, still have ""Dojo for Doge super computer"" coming, still have Dogecoin on the moon event coming. It's not all doom and gloom, Doge will be ok."
11439,Too the 🌙
11440,"Dogecoin is a trailer park coin sorry.  It makes cryptocurrency a joke, especially the community that buys it.  Eth, ADA, POLY, VECHAIN all solid."
11441,Kevin looks 10yrs younger-Disneyland rlly is the most magical place on earth
11442,"Kevin, why waste your time on doge when you can talk about cryptos that has real fundamental impacts on society. Foe an example Carndo, Vechain. 

Love your vids BTW, 🚀"
11443,There it’s...the Slow bleeding 🩸
11444,Oh so your simple enough to think it crashed from a bad joke?  The joke hadn't happened yet when the crash happened bro. 2 words. Do research. Another 2. Barry Silbert.
11445,Well yeah the scripts  are done ahead that’s how it works
11446,Doge millionaire really thought he'd hit 3 mill😂 he should've sold off before the show 🤦‍♂️
11447,Robinhood straight up freezes. It's not about not filling orders. You can't even cancel your order.
11448,Next for doge is 0
11449,Ads ads ads ads
11450,They even had lucid motor commercials. First I’ve seen.
11451,I want to go to Disney too
11452,Thanks for the video Kev!
11453,Ada  taking Doge money 🚀🚀🚀🚀
11454,You dont usually look like you've lost a bunch of money lol
11455,my brother tried buy at 0.18 cents and robinhood took a day to fill. ended up buying at 0.31 cents.
11456,SnL isn't great either Kevin. It sucks Doge....
11457,"I prefer normal Kevin over ""1950s Boston talk radio Kevin"". I've noticed he kind of shifts between a ""character"" maybe and a more conversational tone. Definitely prefer the conversational tone, just some feedback."
11458,Looks like Kevin been crying about the fall of Doge 🤣
11459,"Hold don’t sell we have support with millionaires, celebrities, big company that has 41k stores will accept doge transactions, Amazon will soon accept doge payment, hedge fund banks are putting billions of dollars if you don’t believe then sell but I’m holding doge has potential"
11460,Dodge coin 6 dollars on 2022 we all gonna see it$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
11461,"EVERYONE BOYCOTT ""SNL"" it turned into a horrible show. They make all the original comedians from the 90's early 2000's look very bad. Ruining there legacy"
11462,My theory is that SNL created a slower burn on the buy side and massive booms on the sell side at coordinated times. I feel this is supported by the rate at which cryptos are able to execute transactions. In most cryptos 7 transactions per millisecond. Visa does 26k per ms this is a signal cryptos are not YET really to be a mainstream transactional currency. These stresser events help advance the technology so thanks SNL/Elon.
11463,Did you think a bunch of elitists would want to help the little man?
11464,Officially one of my favorite youtubers ❤
11465,My wife punched in the face for not selling at 0.73 ahhh jahshdbdjehdbd
11466,Manipulating buying and selling is a felony.
11467,Sell in 0.70
11468,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news."""
11469,SNL blows
11470,When you’re a HOLDLAHHHHH and don’t care if doge hits .70 or .30 because you bought it under a penny. Just holding the bag until my hands get tired one day. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😂
11471,Disney volg any chance
11472,Elon musk is no better then the next billionaire. I thought he was different. He take the average persons last dollar before he would give them a penny. Thought he was for helping people he tricked us just to add to his billions.
11473,I'm not a sellout
11474,*If ya didn’t learn anything from the 4/20 so called hype then this DOGE and crypto in general might not be for you.... just stick to the BTC and ETH of the world and play it safe*
11475,I'm so glad I don't have real money invested in this
11476,HOLD Strength No WEAKNESS
11477,oh yeah you are talking about fundamental investing buhaahahha you are this type of investor buahahah man you are talking to teenagers and people without any financial knowledge base on comments here your channel is an evidence that in usa most people know nothing about economic
11478,SNL is horrible
11479,"people sold, in anticipation of a big spike. Let the weak leave and the true futurist will prevail!"
11480,I sold at .70 yesterday. Saw this coming a mile away. It was the same with doge day. Pump early sell off at the “trigger”
11481,Dogecoin has no use value. FOMO'ers deserved to get rekt
11482,Money going to ETC
11483,Kevin could of made half a milli if he didn't sell on the first run up
11484,SNL stunk. Elon messed up. I know Whos the whale.
11485,"checking in, reporting for duty, MBUD or bust"
11486,Who is stupid enough to still use Robin Hood? The Game Stop fiasco didn't teach you that Robin Hood will screw its users to benefit the banks? IDIOTS! Just switch to reputable brokerage. Time to remove the baby training wheels and move to a legitimate platform.
11487,Check Trias it's mooning 🤑🚀🚀
11488,SNL is junk now. It was great in the 90s.
11489,"SNL lost its way by hiring nothing but Ivy League, woke, safe space actors and writers.  Nothing they do is comedy anymore.  The minute that virtue signaling takes over, I tune out."
11490,"I sold dogecoin at 0.66, a few moments before the fall."
11491,I just bought at .05 sold at $.68 suckers what’s funny is all the whales are buying up the bitcoin you sold to buy doge
11492,Woke up. Lost $300
11493,Hey how come you have a beard one day and other day than you have no beard.
11494,Doge has always been a joke. Wtf.
11495,Shut the FUCK UP!!!
11496,I guess doge really is a joke.
11497,If the price of an investment is based on a snl  skit then I would worry about the fundamentals of that investment.
11498,AMC 🚀
11499,"So, the whales sold more DOGECOIN.
Nothing new.
As soon as they drive the price down to where they want it, the whales will buy back in.
That will send the price skyrocketing back up.
And all the nervous nellies who panic sold will begin buying back in.
All this did was create yet another buying opportunity.
DOGECOIN still has tremendous upside, and I won't be surprised to see it hit $10 by the end of this year.
The party ain't over, till it's over."
11500,It’s pain man
11501,Doggy coin did start as a joke did it not?
11502,Come on Kevin! We all know that anything on tv is scripted propaganda. Its all built in.
11503,WETHEMMOONBUDDIES LFG
11504,Im Not F..cking Selling !!!
11505,easy come easy go damn it
11506,"<<< Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crpto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mcknight Lisa  program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Lisa  can be reached on 🆃🅴🅻🅴🅶🆁🅰🅼@ {McKnightlisa}"
11507,People still watch SNL?
11508,It’s so funny watching people see an SNL episode for the first time.
11509,CITADEL is pumping DOGE on RH so all the GME AMC APES head that way. Do a video on this. When will CITADEL gets Fock??\
11510,Same exact thing happened to me. Took screenshots shots. I am sold my doge at .60 then wanted to buy back in. Set an order to buy back at .50 then changed my mind and  Couldn't cancel my buy order at .50 cents. Robinhood is a scam
11511,"As usual, SNL sucked!  That show hasn't been good for a LONG time..."
11512,imagine not having a day off in 15 months Kevin2024
11513,Kevins wasted probably shouldn’t do wasted videos if you’re going to run for governor dog
11514,So the coin will not go up now?
11515,"Haha I love seeing DOGE crash, I enjoyed shorting it last night."
11516,More people sell during a dip
11517,Reminds me of CCIV when they confirmed.....
11518,I think you might be wrong it usually shoots up a few days later
11519,"Doge lovers: The coin has uses! It's fundamentals are tight! There is adoption!

Also doge lovers: We rely on a tech giant who has no actual connection to the coin to pump it."
11520,Oh Dogecoin 🥺
11521,"Woke up this morning, seeing I lost $6000."
11522,I couldn’t buy any yesterday. Weird
11523,SNL hasn't been funny in a decade
11524,"This is why I think Kevin would be good in government. Even when he's on vacation he thinks about the ""little people"" his followers and stops to take the time to make a video for us. This is a character trait not many of any government officials have these days. Thanks Kevin you got my vote!!"
11525,Buy crypto at crypto exchanges and you will have no problem with selling.
11526,Haha
11527,Much thanks Elon -$200 and dropping return he needs to just keep his ass on Twitter
11528,I'm more inclined to buy Doge than ever. I will just wait a week for this SNL thing to die off.
11529,Sad😂😂😂
11530,I expected about a 30% dip so I’m going to buy more come Monday morning. I think they’ll be another “buy the rumor” in another month or two.
11531,"see this everywhere today, lookin guud"
11532,Crypto are beenie babies not currency
11533,Ethereum Classic turn
11534,Meet Kevin You need to make a trading platform app. I am done with all these huge companies taking advantage of us. You for the ppl. Let's go. I will follow you. :)
11535,I thought SNL got canceled in the 1990s. It must be a really crappy show these days. I never hear about it . Lol
11536,You don’t watch SNL.  It’s been horrible sitcom for 20 years.  How they survive   Who knows. ?
11537,Robinhood is a joke. Glad I never used that exchange.
11538,Fck Molly Cyrus too talk about ZERO talent !!
11539,Doge is a joke
11540,EM has become a loser
11541,"Fck dogecoin and yall full of shit, just making all these BS videos to hustle money from YouTube. Fuck you Elon Musk you scumbag"
11542,I was not able to sell. Glad I just had some play money in Doge. If not I would be livid. Plus all the possibly new investors may never invest due to last night's disaster.
11543,"$Doge is *cornered*, I dont get youtubers not mentioning it! Its 688 wallets that hold 80% of all Doge."
11544,Lol! Big joke
11545,Stop using Robinhood!!
11546,You are my hero.
11547,I put everything i had in to this coin because i believed but mostly i felt that im lowest in life financially that i ever been so i went all in because im desperate now i lost my ass. Im struggling with this
11548,I was hoping he would joke about how people need to get out of doge. It's over everyone.  It's just another coin and probably more volatile and more likely to crash drastically.  Anyone getting in above .50 is asking to hold the bag and hopefully just gambling money.
11549,"My cell order happened immediately, on Robinhood."
11550,The show has sucked for years
11551,"Sorry 
I sell all 63000 coin at .66 
I won"
11552,The concerns I have is doge is dogshit and how many people are willing to fomo in on something cause everyone else is. Great for those who have made money but a lesson those who think they’re gonna get rich loading up on some nonsense they know nothing about.
11553,You look sick grow your beard back out man
11554,Safemoon and Spore are poised to make moves!
11555,Dogecoin... I Believe
11556,market cap ?
11557,I guess no dollar eh?..lmao!!
11558,Exited dogecoin before the show. Just didn't make sense for dogecoin being worth more than tether.
11559,"I think we all just got ""hustled"""
11560,Price goes down I buy more! Don’t let a little speculation dump scare you guys!!
11561,Bro ain't you on vacation go be with your family we'll see you Monday lmaooo
11562,I hope Doge goes back to $0.01 where it belongs.
11563,Hang in there! 🐕 have some faith 🪙 ! To Mars! 🚀
11564,It was a big scam... Elon even warned us not invest our life savings 😉. Sold at 73 cents I’m about to go shopping good luck holding on to dogecoin. RIP DOGE
11565,You don't look so well! When was your last covid test bro?🤔
11566,Is this the first time Kevin saw SNL? Is all he think it was was a Elon doge pump? Stop dreaming Kevin. SNL is shit.
11567,Facts that ish sucked
11568,Dude are you drunk!
11569,AMC TO THE MOOON!!!
11570,Upvote for more Drunk Kevin market live streams
11571,hodl or nah 🤦🏽‍♂️😭🤷🏽‍♂️
11572,Webull cancel 15x my order
11573,"SNL was great! Me thinks ur expectations were too high. The whole tongue-in-cheek goal of SNL is to poke fun and garner laughs. They did both. Elon was great. Announcing he has Asperger's in the beginning was brilliant. Lorne did a wonderful job of writing skits that Elon was comfortable in and I think a huge success! Anyone placing hopes and dreams on an SNL appearance is misguided. Doge has no explanation, so, was he to make something up to appease the masses? Love ya Kevin, but, think u missed the mark here."
11574,"honestly who actually thought a coin, an abandoned project,  with a dog on it and inflates by 15 million  coins a day , roughly 5 billion a year was going to be the next world currency? 🤣 🤣 🤣"
11575,Couldn’t watch this video ; I’m on vacation
11576,And that is why I’m not holding doge.
11577,Elon Musk wtf
11578,People are panic selling their dogecoin...  I'm not selling mine because this happened before when it's value fell and then skyrocket few months later.
11579,Dude what’s your cash app I’m tired of that jacket
11580,LFG
11581,Stupid scriptwriter of SNL made the dogecoin go down by joking negatively about dogecoin.
11582,SNL is just horrible.  Its unwatchable. It has nothing to do with Musk its the writing and the actors. Jumped the shark years ago.
11583,"Bro, this guy on vacation 😂🤣😂🤣"
11584,"It is a joke. You expected SNL, one of the worst shows still on TV, to push doge, one of the worst coins in the space, to somehow make this inflationary coin worth a dollar? You're better than this.

At the time of ""writing this,"" doge is .4486. So."
11585,I told ppl elon wasn't going to say shit good about doge coin don't no why everybody be so hype when he speak i knew this was going to be bad for doge elon be playing with ppl emotions and i don't blame him with how stupid ppl are so easily to control
11586,Crypto clueless
11587,I think it was a lot of people just trading it for the news. BUY the DIP....BUY the DIP.....LALALALA.
11588,Rh crashed at the moment I was going to sell and in turn I've lost $- almost 3k I think they should be held responsible and pay back or credit people on there loss at that point they definitely need to be investigated like coin seed was
11589,Elon literally warned ya'll lol
11590,"Holding doge, this is just a minor setback, this isn’t the first time with doge! Doge to the moon let’s go!!"
11591,FOMO… I think most of the investor is a newbie like me and just put in the basket because it was a trendy and everybody talking about Dogecoin. I hope you and all influencer can approach and convince us to HOLD for a long term investment. I love Doggy as well Dogecoin and l believe Dogecoin is our future.. for students and all human in this planet…xoxo
11592,"This was a replay of CCIV / Lucid (I was a diamond hander 🥲), slow bleed here we come."
11593,"Remember when SNL was funny.....sadly Pepperidge farms remembers.
Dogecoin to the moon, Alice!"
11594,"Vaca videos !!!!  Enjoy , have fun and bring us with you!"
11595,Go enjoy your vacation. Jeez. Doge can wait. Lol
11596,"Elon the puppet,Way to sign up to act for the opps,I knew this shit as gunna fail."
11597,I think he just wanted to get a better cost basis
11598,We will get Tesla will accept doge before the next crash ! But begining next week it’s all gonna be rumors !!!
11599,Satalite reveal with connection with dogecoin and Elons super computer and Amazon and Robinhoods separate wallets. Just one of those anousements will shoot it past 75 cents
11600,Well I took out my principal plus 200% profit out 1 month ago
11601,SNL still has an audience? News to me.
11602,Doge deserves to be right back at 1 penny and that's generous
11603,Doge is garbage
11604,"Elon mom: “I am so excited that it is not Doge!”
Elon: “yes it is “!!!!
Kevin He didn’t say No ! But that is why Doge went down because rich people buy presents only if they are on sale !!!! I know riches mentality !!!!"
11605,No no Robinhood did me dirty
11606,Show was ass!!! Who tf watches that
11607,All drops were caused by Bitcoin! Just right now!!
11608,Diamond hands here I'm in it for the big haul...
11609,"Look at the Brighter side... Elon Musk will use your DogeCoin to colonize Mars. 
At least not all is wasted."
11610,Where's the beard ?
11611,"Watched it. Cringe was when the newscaster said, So its a hustle"", and Elon nodded in agreement ""To the Moon!"""
11612,"It needs to go to zero, that's all it's worth."
11613,"Bunch of whales taking profit, paper hand traders, scalpers, and panic sellers. Buy the dip and HODL to $1."
11614,Sell sell sell
11615,bonfire!!!!! got my money 🚀🚀only in 2 days!!🤑
11616,#DUMPDOGE
11617,Kevin sounds weird. Sore throat?
11618,"I used to love SNL back in the 90’s n after last night I seen I haven’t missed anything since then lol I couldn’t even watch everything..thank goodness for ff options 😂😂
Im still keeping the little Doge I have but sold a little at .70"
11619,ELON WARNED EVERYONE. AND ALSO IN THE PAST TO US BASICALLY HODL. WHY WOULD THEY MENTION IT ON SNL AND THEN DROP IT? SIMPLE. TO PICK UP NEW BUYERS. STOP BLAMING ELON. HE TOLD YOU TO HOLD AND HE WARNED YOU BEFORE SNL. WHY PROMOTE IT AND THEN DROP IT? THINK.
11620,Robinhood crypto is not available in a lot of countries that webull is available
11621,"Lol buy the rumor, sell the news"
11622,Is your $DOGE sick? Take it to the $VET. VeChain.
11623,"Buy the hype, sell the news. Always."
11624,SNL hasn’t had a decent “script” for decades!  Enjoy Disneyland—don’t work today 🎉
11625,Binance in Europe has no problem to fulfill my order ! It’s only in the US the riches don’t want the poor to buy the dips on Doge !!!! In two weeks it will be +100%! Lol
11626,"Please spread this out! 
The dogecoin got massively sold off becoz of the SCAMMER stole ppl's dogecoin, by using ""donate and get 2x return back"" during the time of SNL. Many investors fell for that scam"
11627,Omgosh.. l almost dont recognized you.. you look more younger and look innocents..LoL…xoxo
11628,SNL has been a disappointment for a whole lotta years 🤣😂
11629,He basically screwed us over
11630,Go with binance
11631,This dogecoin is gonna be worse than GameStop .. it’s gonna coming down
11632,Snl has sucked for 15 years now
11633,Stop hatin on Doge
11634,bag hodlers!! :))
11635,"why bother with dogecoin? just go to casino and bet it all on red , you get your results much faster"
11636,Worst case scenario is they are performing arbitrage on their customers. 25 minute wait when crypto exchanges are getting immediate sell and buy orders is suspicious to say the least. We have already seen slimy tactics on RobinHoods part to make a buck so I wouldn’t put it past them.
11637,LMAOOOOO BAGHOLDERS WEEEPPPP!
11638,"gee, you mean a tv show well past its prime with subpar, politically childish actors didnt pump our fave coin? Say it aint so.  Expectations were far too high for this"
11639,The fact that peole are shocked and mad  that DOGE did not pump and go to the moon over and SNL skit is amazing.  Special guest Elon Musk on SNL followed by REKT city.  Shame on you all for expecting otherwise...
11640,It wasn't SNL. It was a whale dumpathon which started before the show aired. Then everyone else panicked and sold. SNL definitely didn't help though. Lol.
11641,Robynhood selling their own dogecoin ahead of the platforms users.
11642,Making up your own currency is kinda like making up your own religion.
11643,This will remove the reliance upon Musk for Dogecoin Growth. So this is a good thing Doge will slingshot back up and pass $1 just give it time. Institutions are still adopting dogecoin as a currency. You can now earn interest on gemeni for doge.
11644,indeed
11645,You Tricked us with the beard in the thumbnail
11646,"Getting flooded with emails from scam coins looking for promotion. Be careful out there guys! Loads of bad actors looking to take the money from your pocket and put it in theirs!….It's crazy when you realise Eth is no longer $500. I see my trqding profits these days and i wonder, why so much money and so few coins I am so used to $10,000 Bit coin  and $300-500 Eth, i am still not used to these new amazing prices. I use to have so many coin but my portfolio wasn’t growing Elliottrades change the narration of my cryptostory, all this changed when I encountered Elliottrades., although I have been into numerous services but Elliot Wainman stands out with experienced expertise in the field. I must confess it wasn't an easy task learning the routes on trading but with his assisstance I earrned a lot, His  Ͳҽ  Iҽ ցɾ ąʍ @ elliotradezcrypto"
11647,"The whole thing went EXACTLY as i predicted (poor SNL performance, Elon having no acting skills, and Doge falling atleast 33%)
Why is anyone surprised ?"
11648,You only lose if you sell 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎🖐🖐
11649,yeah the show is garbage.  Elon's monologue was decent. had a couple laughs. the OJ lines were pretty laugh out loud dark funny which I really loved.  but SNL as a show has spiraled into obscurity over the past couple decades since the sandler-rock-spade-farley years.  it's pretty telling when the funniest cast member of the past 15 years was Shane Gillis - the comic they fired 72 hours after announcing he was hired for last season due to his dark funny stuff he has said on comedy podcasts in the past.  but SNL's major claim to fame recently is they fired the only funny comic they had 3 days after hiring him.. and one of the other cast members is currently f***ing scarlet johansson.
11650,Kevin where is your beard!?
11651,When you get to social and media technical analysis you are now the everything store of u tube.     And yet. Kevin can do it.    This is the best of controlled manic energy.  And that Includes stable but hyper activity.      Waiting for the market analysis w lap top  at the top of the Mattahorn or on space mountain  🎢 .    😁😁
11652,"Currently at .38
Not a slow bleed, this is a bloodbath"
11653,Oh well buy more
11654,Buy on rumor sell on news ! Elon told yesterday he will buy some doge for his mom birthday ! He certainly will when doge would be -60% on sale ! And kaboom doge crashed ! It all makes sense!! But don’t worry in 2 weeks doge will be +100%!!!
11655,"I should’ve sold, I should’ve trust my instincts and sold. Knew it was coming 🤢"
11656,No the whales pumped and dumped. For them it was a very good deal. The small people feed the canons. Invest in OMI. Thats real!!!
11657,I don’t think it went as bad as people think. Lol but we shall see
11658,Go enjoy your vacation with your family
11659,Never trusted robinhood and still don’t trust robinhood. I wouldn’t be surprised if this company fall like Enron.
11660,Joke: Technical Analysis of a joke. 😁 come on kev do better than that talk about real coins. Millionaires don't mess with projects that are entertainment
11661,SNL has not been funny for a long time.
11662,This dude Kevin is fucking hilarious. Bro will make a YouTube video based on anything finance literally anywhere.
11663,"The same thing happened to me. They sold my shares like 15 min later..I thought the same thing. They let us buy but not sell... everything that was said was made to look like Doge was a joke.  I don't think any SNL skits are made without thought, especially in the polarized climate where in currently. That skit was a set up! I switched to fidelity because of the March freeze up with Robin hood. They are obviously still the same and won't change..Why do they need for when they have so much money and don't have live customer service. I love the colors on Robinhood and how easy it is to but I wana speak to a person If I have a problem with my money.."
11664,"I lost money yesterday when doge tanked and my Robinhood app wouldn't work. Tried selling at .65, wouldn't let me."
11665,"There was 0% chance doge would pump after SNL, most obvious peak euphoria in the history of the multiverse"
11666,"SNL - really I mean really poor script writing. Let's bring in New talent and hire some new story writers. Elon did really well even with those poor scripts. 
But expecting Doge to move because of this stupid show is plain stupid."
11667,Continue to buy especially while DOGECOIN is on sale right now
11668,"địt mẹ Elon, chúng ta đều là những con lừa hahah"
11669,it's not SNL's job to help ignorant Robinhood investors with their crypto that they do not understand.
11670,"Pumping doge kills your credibility, Gov'nor Weenie Baby 🤡🤡🤡"
11671,Lol this doge support is some of the most irresponsible content for your viewers ;)
11672,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
11673,safe the doggos
11674,"Check out SHIB, Shiba Inu Coin."
11675,Look at it now....
11676,Went exactly how I expected
11677,The Samething happened during the April 20th hype. People expected 0.69$ on April 20th but it crashed to 0.22 levels before it went back up to break 0.42 and 0.69 in just 2 weeks.
11678,Shiba Inu
11679,Thanks Kevin
11680,"I sold out just now, went from +1900 to 1000, ffffff cya."
11681,buy and hold dogecoin! only idiots are selling now....
11682,HOLD!
11683,OTC
11684,Also 0.69 was the resistance not the support. No one was trying to buy at 0.69$ instead there were tons of sell orders at 0.69$ people trying to make few bucks on doge.
11685,Just gotta keep holding until $10.00
11686,"I know one thing many people watched Saturday night live.  I enjoyed the show.  When you rely on hype,  famous people and poorly run companies to invest in. Well you might as well dig a hole and throw your money in. Don't build your house on sinking land!"
11687,"You wonder if the scripts were premade?  I'll save you the suspense... SNL is scripted... they don't make everything up on the fly.  It isn't ""Whose Line..."""
11688,"THESE DAYS IF YOU'RE NOT SPENDING TO RECOVER,THEN STOP SPENDING ?"
11689,You sound like Justin Trudeau.
11690,One guy having so much power over the price is a real issue
11691,All of my stock pickers that I follow are shilling crypto now. I think a lot of the stock market money from our fave growth stocks is now in crypto. I personally got fed up and sold a portion on my stocks in order to buy more crypto. Because my crypto account has tripled since October and my stocks have gone down 50%.
11692,It was so bad...
11693,This happens when Investing in a big plate of nothing.
11694,I always say with trendy investments to sell the morning of or night before the biggest anticipated events. People always sell off right before the major expected events.
11695,Thanks for taking the time on your vacation to give us an update! That’s awesome of you
11696,You better go look again because it’s crashing right now well you got one hand up Mickey skirt this thing is tanking

11698,"Never trust the elites
Elon musk definitely doesn't give two shits about you.
They are all the same ppl"
11699,That's the face of a guy who just lost A LOT of money
11700,"I dont care, i'm still holding!!"
11701,Love this content. Thank you for all you do.
11702,Anyone who invest in Dogecoin is just dumb. I bought in at 1 penny and sold at 70 cents. Doge was a short term way to make money. It will never reach a $1. I understood that and got out. Invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum for thIs bull run.  Anything else is just a rookie mistake.
11703,Love you brotha!
11704,Yes crypto's are pyramid schemes. Funny it took some people so long to figure this out.
11705,Buy Ethereum Classic and hold get in now before 200$
11706,"SNL has been ""not great"" for over 10 years now. This is the first episode I've watched in about as long."
11707,"Not your keys , not your crypto .... Stop buying derivatives for crypto"
11708,"I don’t get why ppl use robinhood , why not use binance or coinbase , the proper digital currency exchange"
11709,Stop buying crypto on stock market exchanges!!!! Buy on coinbase/coninbase pro these stock market exchanges just trying to hedge with your money buy adding crypto to their platform lol 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂 stock market dying
11710,It’s .44 now.   I’m more disappointed on how terrible Saturday night live is now it’s completely unwatchable not one of those people are funny it’s time to pull the plug on that show
11711,Why is everyone expecting it to pump? Like it’s a GME situation with retail thinking it’ll moon out of nowhere lmao holding 43000 doge at .02 here 😂
11712,SNL: still not funny
11713,I wasn't watching that shit from the jump now I'm losing money fuck elon musk
11714,"I called it!!!   Doge hype is dead, Shiba Inu is now the king.  Doge is now ruined officially by elon, he should just had stayed with his tweets.  Wy buy now just do a 2x, there other great projects that can do 10x,. This Doge because a market distraction"
11715,Boycott Tesla
11716,The suits can’t handle watching the little guy have a run no matter how insignificant
11717,"Chill out on the commercials, there's a commercial every 2 minutes"
11718,Doge sucks
11719,Enjoy your vacation!
11720,"Who cares, APE IN NOW"
11721,Pleb
11722,Lmao doge is a meme coin no real purpose true crypto traders invest into bitcoin etherum chainlink polka dot cardano
11723,"In a year doge won’t even be a thing 
I’ve been saying all along it’s 
Dog shit"
11724,Hopefully people can flip their profits into a deflationary digital asset. Doge is a joke for so many reasons.
11725,Buy. The. Dip.
11726,Bonefire is rising tho
11727,Fuck yeah Kevin
11728,Lol something with no value drop
11729,How can there be billions of trades on thousands of stocks Monday-Friday and these platforms seemingly run seamless but they can’t handle one crypto
11730,"brah, doge is perfectly fine. If it didnt let off steam I would be more worried than this. It just dipped from 42ish to like 15 just like days ago. So from 72 is to 40ish is normal. U gotta learn crypto more bro. SNL was all good."
11731,I would say explaining crypto is the equivalent to explaining paper money to someone who only has known a barter economy.
11732,Irony of ironies- socual comedy about a crypto comedy
11733,I miss the beard
11734,Scripts have sucked for years. It’s political and not comedy
11735,"It's a Financial Risk That SNL isn't trying to take. Paper Hands Sell Because we dont need you anyway, Diamond Hands Baby! 💎🌱🚀"
11736,"Lol even with the SNL dive, I am only in gains right now because I sold off my initial investment a while back, so I'm riding this roller coaster risk free. Originally bought between 2-4 cents each lol."
11737,Its not the skits. the Show is not that great
11738,weenie babies anyone??? jeeze... get a grip... wasn't it Warren Buffett who said the best approach to investing is to based your strategy on who is hosting SNL... you're smart
11739,ETC WILL TAKE OVER! 📈📈📈
11740,"Play stupid games (buy doge) win stupid prizes( get rekt thinking a comedy show talking about a meme coin is going to pump your bag)

Now that you’ve learned your lesson buy into real coins with real use case"
11741,sell doge or lose it all !
11742,Kevin ain't drunk. He has heat stroke.
11743,"again, DOGE NEVER has t o go above $1, the best tradable investment with the DIPS. 25 % GAINS IN 1 DAY"
11744,Elon is scaring the whales out period get ready guys
11745,That guy robinhood need to go to jail.
11746,"I loved the episode, Elon did great. Very clever skits playing off Elon's uniqueness."
11747,Doge plummeting
11748,#Bonfire
11749,Since bitcoin could get to 58k so quickly then 150k ending of this year is very possible....
11750,"I bought 20,000 on the dip"
11751,"Kevin: I would like to go to Disney to have fun and relax, wouldn't make videos over this weekend. Also Kevin: Ok, I am in Disney, here goes Doge price commentary"
11752,it was dumping before that... looking for an entry level
11753,Butt of the joke because it is a joke
11754,I rate the stupidity of the USA on how much 🐕 coin goes up ill be 👀
11755,It reminded me immediately why I don't watch SNL anymore
11756,I lost my money in the stock market
11757,Kevin is gambling with DOGCOIN? Come on Kevin. Invest in fundamentals and not a meme.
11758,"Excuse my Norwegian, but... WHO THE FUCK accepts 20 minutes to fill a market taker order? I mean, it's understandable if it's a limit order, but wtf???"
11759,"Thumbnail: 🧔 
Actual video: 👶"
11760,"I love your content mr kevin, your a awesome smart guy, but i have to respectfully disagree with the SNL being totally negative. I think its a good thing that he said “to the moon” in his glasses and good that it was mentioned at all. I guess you can look at it both ways."
11761,"I think the saying goes, “Buy the hype, sell the news.”"
11762,"I don't think it's wise to blame Musk for pushing Doge down, when institutional traders were literally lining up to short the thing. In fact, I think he did a _service_ to all retail investors, who has now learned the hard way that nothing is a sure thing in the trading world. In any case I don't think there's much to worry about. The biggest Doge wallet of them all is still accumulating: DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L"
11763,Elon musk is a piece of shit
11764,"Kevin, are you at wilderness lodge"
11765,So basically all you have to do is invest in a stock before it goes viral?
11766,Dogcion is nothing he go to 1 cent
11767,Bro go be with your family lol
11768,I disagree. But then I didn't have high hopes for SNL in the first place. It's not as good as it used to be in its heyday. I still think Musk's portrayal of the CEO of SpaceX was stellar. Oscar next?
11769,"Investing after it’s already up thousands of percent is pretty stupid given this coin mints 10,000 every few minutes ."
11770,I don't even watch SNL... glad I didn't stay up for that.
11771,Bonfire crypto will be next....
11772,Doge coin is a classic pump and dump scheme if your not the one pumping your probably the one getting dumped on.  Stop chasing get rich quick schemes and every hyped stock or crypto out their.
11773,Hopefully the whales pull out
11774,All pump and dumps...
11775,Nah man the show sucked
11776,Easy .... citadel needed to front run the traffic to make money.....come on kev....why I never touched dogecoin....
11777,Fuck dogecoin you fomo idiots
11778,RIP DOGE 🐕
11779,MoonBud to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
11780,"Doge IS a joke. Don’t you get it yet?!  Please, Go spend time with your family."
11781,Elon Musk would have been better off not going on SNL IMO and in consideration of my investment..why would he make negative references about Doge after bigging it up for months?? I smell a rat. Apparently too may would have come up. This would have been a true revolution. Come on Jeff!
11782,RIP DOGE
11783,but those eyelashes ...
11784,🌖 MOONBUD to the MOON 🚀🐕
11785,thats the most predicted in all of crypto. The people that still falls for it are morons.
11786,"I went from 200% gain, then robinhood screwed me, turned it into 0 gains. Literally back at breakeven. This sucks."
11787,"Elon was a better actor than the normal cast. And every time miley performed DOGE dropped... 
DOGE also dropped hard when they did the doctor skit and made fun of the new language kids these days use..."
11788,🌖 MOONBUD 🐕
11789,"Those cast members who refused to be part of this show did so because Elon is “super rich” and these liberal idiots said they refused to work with someone that rich.  
Which itself is quite rich, since their fucking boss, Disney, who owns nbc, is pretty fucking rich as well.  

These ppl are the worst.  The sooner society realizes this, the better.   The left has lost its collective mind."
11790,Didn't watch it...but I haven't watched it since the original cast when they had real humor and not a political agenda
11791,I think Kevin's drunk or sleepy or both? 😂 😂 😂 Enjoy ur vacay!!
11792,Your ears are very red. How much you lost on dogecoin mate?
11793,"lol @ noobs still trading on robinhood,  let alone buying a shit coin like doge, and not immediatley getting rid of it as sonn as you profitted, lmao noobs will be noobs"
11794,"This is good for the market. Doge is a joke, as is SNL."
11795,All Maye had to say was that I hope it's Dogecoin. To the moon baby.
11796,"Doge was pumping. SNL writes scriptS. Soon as his mom said she hopes she doesn’t receive  doge for Mother’s Day it tanked .

I feel like the writers set him up because some of them don’t like his tweets or political beliefs"
11797,"When you buy it works fine, but when you wanted to sell they wouldn’t let you 🙄"
11798,It’s true I try to sell I couldn’t do it...
11799,I wanna give Elon’s mom a back massage for Mother’s Day since she don’t want no Doge.
11800,"Crypto ""fudamentals""😂🤣😂"
11801,Its just stopping for a charge..
11802,Robinhood doesn't sell crypto...they only let people speculate on price ..legit exchanges allow you to send and receive crypto.. Robinhood is the ONLY exchange I have seen is literally ripping ALL of their customers off
11803,Dodge detour to hell negative 30% as I speak 50 cent  hahaha I told these fools
11804,Robinhood sounds like a scam....keeping people from being able to make thier own decisions.
11805,"Thanks for the more informative videos on Dogecoin oppose to those making videos to gloat or just for clout! People need information on how to stay invested or not!. Very refreshing, I’m holding btw! ☺️ 
🚀🚀🚀"
11806,"Courage has taught me no matter how bad a crisis gets... any sound Investment will eventually pay off.  investing is a very long journey where our temperament gets tested, we really need to change our approach towards the market, many are SOFT (Selling Outta Frustration & Tension)"
11807,Ay no lie but that mars skit I thought was pretty funny. The rest of it sucked though
11808,🔥BONFIRE! 🔥
11809,"The pump happened before SNL, $0.70 was it"
11810,also doge coin is an inefficient crypto with transactions speeds slow as turtles. add that plus a ton of orders you get slow buy and sells
11811,Doge still a joke😂 not real utility
11812,"Nah man, it was pumped on the news of SNL. There was no way it would run with so much time knowing this event is coming."
11813,I tried to buy and it was pending for a while. The SNL skits wasn't bad.  It was meant to be funny and it was. We didn't get the spike we wanted but praying it comes eventually. I'm holding! #dogetothemoon 🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕
11814,"This is why you Buy on Rumor / Hype, Sell on News!"
11815,Hardest worker on the internet! Long live Kevin! Long live the Doge💎
11816,Thank you Kevin
11817,ADA 🚀🚀🚀
11818,Lol he didn't think twice making a video about this crap 🤣 fraud
11819,"Doge is a old project ment to be a joke. It has 12 main holders and one of them own 30% (killer whale 🐋). There are plenty of crypto to invest in, and if you want to gamble there is even alt coins. If your scared and want to just put your savings somewhere to survive the inflation, you can always use a combo of crypto and stocks. So please people stop with the Doge."
11820,Paper hands never prosper
11821,Fuck Dogecoin to death!
11822,"🤗 🌈I thought SNL was funny and Elon was extremely funny, I was laughing 😆 so hard - then I checked my DOGE account ... 😬.  I didn’t think DOGE was the butt of the joke.  I think it was manipulated once again by a large institution.-  I still have my DOGE COIN!  Not going to consider selling till I 30,000x my profit.  😁👍🌈"
11823,"SNL is garbage show thats why it tanked, just like SNL's ratings 😂"
11824,LMFAO…ppl still using Robinhood ???? SERIOUSLY ???
11825,"l recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get person who invested with her 
comment below"
11826,Saw that coming🤬🤬🤬
11827,SNL always sucks.   A d why would degecoin be on snl
11828,"When he gave that Dog to his mother he literaly gave up every responsibility from his person...smart move from smart guy who looks like loving son...nobody can blame him,this hype was trap from beggining"
11829,SNL hasn't been good for 15 years.. shocked anyone watched it.
11830,I think musk doesn't care if people lose their shirts.  Feel sad for people who fomo'd at the top and new to crypto.   They probably fear panicked and lost tons of money.
11831,"Not sure which was worse, the Doge crash or the SNL content."
11832,Crypto is not traditional stock. Can’t use same analysis.
11833,April 20 & SNL = No Help
11834,Come on Maye. Enjoy your Doge.
11835,"LOTS of us made money, doge still got big talks of use lol ppl are tripping after buying at .70 lol yall didn't bitcoin before huh? 😆 

Snl is radical liberal trash... they worship govt... crypto in general sticks it to the govt... you expected it to be a huge doge commercial?  🤣 it was name recognition, and it'll pay off just wait. Bitcoin BLEW up and TANKED soooo many times and started at pennies. I suggest doing DD on doge, its not a bad crypto at this point, it'll be fine imho."
11836,The inability to sell is because you are selling derivatives of crypto on Robin Hood and they likely didnt have sufficient liquidity to cover the sales that were going on
11837,"If any part of your investment thesis involves Elon Musk going on SNL and pumping a fake crypto currency he's made a fortune talking you into buying, you have a bad thesis"
11838,Doge is trash.
11839,I don't get why so many people had hope in this coin??
11840,They played your minds. Had safe moon before the whale jumped in. He needed mother's day gift lol
11841,Homie bought the doge high and we saw whales sell he went straight to the adult bar in Disney land I sold at 70 hope y’all see secured
11842,Enjoy your vacation my friend!
11843,I bought at 0.62 but it’s only 100 coins. 😂
11844,kevin still using the same thumbnail even after shaving the beard
11845,"Most people don't understand the concept of "" buying the dip "" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down . Holding is profitable , although trading is far more profitable . I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough , but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Keaton Jasson services., although i have been into numerous services but Keaton Jasson stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Keaton it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel - gram ( @KeatonExpert ) for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns..."
11846,"Your disappointed cuz I think you were anticipating like some type of reassurance from Musk to buy dogecoin. Fact is Musk is rich, he doesn't give a fuck he can be saying dogecoin this week and some other bullshit next week."
11847,"The reason they take so long to fill is because that are trying to lock in a better price for themselves during the crash. So they profit off your sell off. 

STOP TRADING ON ROBINHOOD! THEY ARE TOOLS OF THE HEDGIES!"
11848,Buy the rumor sell the news
11849,Elons mother has class and obviously knows DOGESHITCOIN is crap
11850,SNL hasn't had a good script in 35 yrs.
11851,Hey I love your show I love you but I don't take you as a type of person to have any Dogecoin. So either you have Dogecoin or your pandering and either way just doesn't feel like you Kevin
11852,Imagine making investment decisions based on SNL skits
11853,Thanks for faking us .
11854,I don’t know how Robinhood survived the GameStop manipulation.
11855,Sounds like ur wifi or phone
11856,"You still found time to shoot a video??
You’re the man! Enjoy your vacation with your family."
11857,Lost everything
11858,Why would anyone watch snl crap ? In fact why would any one go to the evil world of Disney ? 🤨
11859,"Doge millionaire guy still has 1mil and Living With Luci probably dropped from 2-1 mil to 900k 

More coins back on the market they’ll be back or just get some Etherium classic"
11860,True !
11861,"The only good thing was Elon.
$DOGE was selling because people wanted to dump high, run on the eBank. You are right about the whale. The run was norm core investors finally buying.

Robinhood shady AF. You are wrong about sell orders. If this was true, no spike near the end."
11862,Where's your beard?😭😭😭
11863,"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office."
11864,doge IS a joke. And robinhood are crooks
11865,It’s a hustle......
11866,"OK so if you want a real way to assess the market cap of Doge it should likely be on par with Litecoin... maybe assuming mass adoption.  They currently mine them both in parallel so the miners get both at the same time.  This only applies right now May of 21.  Litecoin has devs and is going to be evolving it's mining and distro and privacy features so this way of looking at it will change but right here right now the market cap of the two might be considered similar assuming mass adoption.  (paypal, sqaure, visa and other retailers need to be on board though)"
11867,SNL is shit
11868,My bro is at Disneyland rn
11869,"If you think the script had anything to do with whales selling, you’re an idiot. Elon killed it, fool."
11870,"Doge if you know, you know."
11871,"Stop buying Doge or any cryptocurrency on non crypto exchanges.  Download Kucoin or Binance, it’s a lot better:"
11872,robinhood is a shady website
11873,Hahahah
11874,any currency with a dog symbol shouldn't be taken seriously
11875,Good thing i sold my doge hours before SNL.
11876,Doge rose to .74 before Snl and was dropping before Snl. People sold its their investment everyone has to do whats best for them. I will buy tge dip for the next runup.🤗
11877,"I thought that you are serious investor, but u never stop talking about nonsense like dogecoin."
11878,"i love a little bit of scruff, but that baby face of yours is adorable"
11879,Doge is a shit coin. Please are you even sane
11880,Drunk?
11881,WHERE MY HODLERS AT?
11882,"JUST KNOW , we will have a NEW ATH 😌😌 on the next RUN with Elon being on SNL especially international we would have MORE USERS buying DOGE 😌😌🤟"
11883,Terrible robotic scripted jokes who the bl***y producer on this show
11884,"HYPER chain
GAMER finance (GMR)
Spore finance 
NFT art finance 
Safemoon all 10000% coins !!"
11885,Dogecoin crash forever..
11886,The original Doge joke was at the end of this video.  Where the Bitcoin billionair was busto and in the end he admits that he's begging for crypto that he was desperate and would take even a Doge coin.  https://youtu.be/UG7zLhEWanc  A joke within a joke.  Plus if you want a real crypto mem just go make an nft and boom you're good.
11887,"Lol, Kevin playing the clout game ever since WSB went mainstream"
11888,"100dma at .40, bounce at .420? Maybe? I don't know"
11889,"I thought Elon did a great job representing Dogecoin on SNL. You have to remember SNL is a comedy show — they make fun of things. 
Keep in mind all the superstars who have gotten their start on SNL (Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey) the list goes on and on. Dogecoin will be a mega star soon!! The price dips so we could sell, making ways for others to join. HOLD!! Dogecoin to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
11890,This guys an idiot ... a whale sold after the monologue with elon and his mom selling off about 15% of the supply in the matter of seconds .... that caused all the retail to get scared and they took another 20% with them . We dropped 35-38% in less than 6 hours .... because of a whale . And people selling . Has nothing to do with the skit .
11891,We were dumped . Straight up stabbed in the back
11892,"Hi my name is Kevin and I'm addicted to vlogging, I even do it when I'm vacation at Disneyland with my kids 😂😂"
11893,Hmm. You're looking and sounding like a man who bought a boat load of Doge ahead of Elon appearing on SNL...
11894,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
11895,Kevin everybody ought to sell Tesla and tank their stock
11896,"Lolz, you guys really think a stock or crypto can get a pump from 1 individual"
11897,Unfortunately it goes back to $0.05 Musk really f..d it up
11898,"Bye the rumor , sell the news"
11899,Don’t stress Kevin my love.  Snl is part of the mainstream and it’s designed to take from the people.   Elon is the herald for a new transfer of wealth to help the people who want to help the world aspire to be the best we can be.  These hiccups will happens and we are building once more.  Do  not stress my brother bc we are dealing with a corrupt system.   We will gain more influence it just take more patience.  We’re dealing with mainstream media who are trying to silence and steal our resources.  We will prevail bc we share TRUTH!!!
11900,What's next for Doge?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  It's a pump and dump.  What's next lol
11901,"Kevin go to bed brother, look like you haven’t slept in Doge years!"
11902,I NEVER would think this gentleman has a cocktail from time to time.  SO MUCH more respect!
11903,This is Massively tesla negative
11904,Buying and hoDling is a losing   man's game.
11905,I bought it at .04 so am good 👍 to the moon
11906,"Any one who was looking for a run is a idiot, the spike occurred beforehand. Sameshit that happened on doge day."
11907,It's ok chill we've seen this already 👍🏼
11908,You look like Kevin’s little brother 😂 👶
11909,"I mean, dont we always say... SELL THE NEWS!"
11910,"Skid on Disney Reopening 

https://youtu.be/7H31osmv4_I"
11911,Have fun staying poor plebs... this was a sell the news event
11912,I thought it was funny your blinded by money
11913,Robinhood's liquidity issue continues...  no surprise here
11914,I thought it was great. I’ve never been so excited about doge
11915,All these dumb fuck Doge holders lol.... It’s going in the ground
11916,"This drop in DOGE and ""miss"" on Elons SNL performance is going to tank the price of tesla stock when the market opens Monday.   Glad I don't hold any Tesla right now 😎"
11917,The point is not dogecoin price. The real takeaway for me is that Elon made a 40 percent drop in five hours. Just by showing up in a show where he was just despising the host by being himself.
11918,then why he said . its gonna go to 1 dollar . @elonmusk is scamming people with gamestop and dogecoin . and even bitcoin . but he cant play with bitcoin to much cuz its limited
11919,"Well, Doge has always been the butt of the joke.  That's the point."
11920,I have watched so much Meet Kevin that I now dream about Meet Kevin and Graham. Its weird guys
11921,Robin Hood is shadey AF
11922,Doge coin: it's a hustle
11923,This shit going down too much man. Pump means dunp
11924,"""GOD"" MAY BITCOIN CRASH THIS MONTH OR YEAR"
11925,"Ok , now take your profits and join the SAFEMOONARMY   !!!!!!!!!"
11926,Disney! Hell yeah.
11927,Oh my..still going down..word hustle is d culprit!
11928,"After watched SNL last night and realized the reason why I stop watching SNL anymore for years... it was very disappointed..... terrible show with bad jokes. The casts, the scripts are just awful. I’m out!! Good analysis man, keeping up."
11929,F f f f f f f sell people sell!!! It's going to the core!
11930,"Im the guy that was ""late to the party""....Bought in at .37 ....After a disaster of last night, i sold at .49 just to make sure i stayed in profit.... This dog(no pun intended) of an investment could easily be back at .20 range in the next week....If you are currently in profit, no matter how small, get out!!"
11931,Can you please explain HODLING HAS NO EFFECT ON AN INFINATE ASSET
11932,Welcome to crypto mate.
11933,WHEN will people see this is a mindless distraction. DOGE has no actual number and is endless. You cannot place a valuation on a chasm. Reprint reprint release more whenever.  DOGE IS A TRAP and a money machine for Elon.
11934,Sell it.
11935,"Historically speaking the dog 🐶 coin pumps first, and ends first and last coin to pump is XRP. Personally I like the fundamentals of XRP so I bought in during the bear market and bought even more when they were sued. XRP is the King 👑  of the Alts due to practical use in today's market place and future prospects. One day XRP will be much much higher to levels people could not imagine. But again that's my opinion."
11936,If doge dies we can finally go back to rising TSLA
11937,"I was NEVER able to buy Dodgecoin on WEBULL. It says "" this Crypto currency is not tradable on WEBULL""!"
11938,maybe turn the AC on bud
11939,Its gonna be the same like after dogeday ^^
11940,"Only if she said “ *I hope it’s doge* “ 
she murder durdur doge 😭"
11941,"Binance , worked just fine.. order took seconds at worst"
11942,Binance US gave me no issue for trading. I got my money and was scraping the drops throughout the whole show. I had 0 issues except my history stopped showing. Checked this morning and my money is still in my US Tether.
11943,coinbase is laughing
11944,I couldn't buy during SNL on RH
11945,"Binance worked fine, buying and selling in seconds"
11946,I got drunk too but hey we can all dream to have some kind of real American Dream
11947,Always sell the news bro
11948,DOGECOIN is to dependent on some guy tweeting and talking on TV shows. It doesn’t hold a value
11949,"Doge always pumps before a big day and drops on the big day, and then it recovers and touches a new high. We're fine. Shut it Kevin."
11950,Anything to do to help the hedge funds...
11951,"Hoping everyone sold it BEFORE SNL. That was the plan right?

Even someone that bought it last weekend would have doubled their money. Crazy times"
11952,Fckk you Elon and your doge you lie and you make me poor
11953,"""Pay for Order flow"" ........ WHY Choose these cheap platforms to trade!   I cannot understand. It's not FREE"
11954,Who’s going to Disney rn to go Meet Kevin lol
11955,Fck yu elon
11956,Robin Hood is doing it again?
11957,They were blocking buying too
11958,Usual story! Experts after the event appear 🤣🤣🤣
11959,"Hell yeah Kevin, Disneyland!!"
11960,"I sold, terrible to say but the quality of investors are a concern for me, let’s be real, 90 percent of these people are not investors and they’ll screw this entire thing up. I don’t have the same faith in people some of you have. I’ll go as far to say, I trust the federal reserve before I trust a random Joe Shmo. I rather put my money in USDC and collect 9 percent interest with guaranteed stability."
11961,Hello again Compadre KEVIN 🍓Don't Trust Robinhood? No working Telephone number 🤗👻
11962,Kevin is sounding like a suit in this video! Dogecoin to $1! 🚀🌕
11963,Buying dogecoin because Elon musk went on SNL...you deserve to lose money
11964,I was just surprised to hear Elon has asberger 🤷🏻‍♂️ my nephew has asberger so it explains his behavior
11965,"Elon was dumping while we were watching😂 If you were like me and got SafeMoon, NFTART, Spore Finance, and especially Gamer token! You have tripled your portfolio in 1 night🚀🚀🚀🚀"
11966,I'm so glad I dumped my Doge a few days ago when it was .72 a coin.
11967,Planned pumps never work. I almost wanted to bet that it would crash during SNL.
11968,Don’t worry guys. Doge impossible to stop. People power is so strong 💪
11969,Why on earth are people trading crypto via a stock broker? If you had actual coins there'd be no way anybody could block your trades.
11970,"You seem stressed out, Kevin, day trading is rough buddy. How many trades did you do today? Mr diamond hands."
11971,"check out bonfire, don’t miss out 🔥 🪵 🚀"
11972,"Any human with any common sense in that melon on top of their shoulders shouldn't have expected Elon Musk's appearance on SNL to be funny and therefore, make or break Dogecoin and it's value. The man is not a comedian, he's a business man. And how the hell is comedy related to cryptocurrency except by the stupid sentence that everyone wants to give us as that ridiculous, burned out history lesson, ""It started as a joke meme in 2013....""??? Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk is not a God to be worshiped that we should hang on his every word in order for us to get rich. He's just a man. Hey Kevin, nice to meet you, but do me a favor, when you're speaking to the world, sober up. Thanks. I believe Mark Cuban gives more solid, concrete tweets about dogecoin than Musk. Elon tweets some hidden, mysterious, beating around the bush type of messages that he might be putting out there while drunk. Reminds me of some countrie's ex-president. Anyway, does ""The Moon"" mean 70 cents or even a dollar? So many cashed out and were done tonight. Stupid move, especially if this thing goes to 2 or 3 dollars, maybe even higher at some point. Look how far we've come in a month or 2. ✌☮"
11973,26 million dollars... and you still running ads on your videos... ironi
11974,"Elon musk called a hustle, not good."
11975,"yeah man ,"
11976,The market makers probably don’t have the cash on hand to pay everyone back who wants to sell their Doge
11977,"like 5 ads dude? you didn't lose that much money, chill"
11978,Perfect example of the reason for stop limit orders!!!
11979,You do realize Elon has zero vested interest in doge?
11980,Dogecoin will be the currency in the future and in 30years we gone replay this snl episode saying “If Elon’s mom received $1000 in dogecoin from Elon for Mother’s Day.”
11981,RobbingHood is living up to its name.
11982,Still got hope ...!!! 💪😜🚀
11983,"Buy now at 0.5+,it will be 1usd, 1month later"
11984,Doge was created as a joke. It isn't supported.  Lol . Due diligence is a must.
11985,GET OFF ROBINHOOD AND GET ON BINANCE AND KUCOIN.  INSTANT BUY AND SELL ORDERS AND LEARN HOW TO READ A DAMN CHART.... BUY NEWS SELL RUMORS THERE WILL NEVER BE $1 DOGE AND ANY BOUNCE WILL BE DEAD CAT BOUNCE. FREEFALL IMMINENT
11986,How much alcohol have you had?
11987,SNL.is leftist trash.
11988,Well....he said it was a hustle...on live tv....lol
11989,Robinhod is the worst place to trade
11990,People still using robbinghood.
11991,It was shit!’
11992,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. 

Remember Dogeday 4/20 was supposed to be a big pump day but instead it dumped quite a bit."
11993,Blood alcohol levels to the moon!
11994,Doge coin will go WAYYYY UPPPPP
11995,Who the hell watches SNL???
11996,Real hustler. Even drunk you are productive 👌 keep the good work buddy
11997,SNL script hasn’t been great since the 90’s
11998,thats why you need a regular exchange not robinhood...
11999,care?  you don't.
12000,"Jesus, addicted, just unplug and vacay with the family"
12001,"My childhood is nuked. Lol that was horrendous.
I'm still holding Doge, but I'm never sitting through that cringe fest again.
I hope that show dies. They sabotaged it on purpose bruh."
12002,Now only 0.53 🤣😂👊
12003,get the beard back. Buy bitcoin not crappy doge.
12004,"Is anyone going to talk about the free doge given out hours before SNL started? I'm sure those who got part of the free 500,000,000 sold half their Doge real fast."
12005,"I ended up watching SNL on Andrei's livestream, some of the skits weren't great but Elon being Elon was pretty entertaining. Doge might've had too much expectation priced in beforehand eh? Anyhow I hope you enjoy your vacation Kevin!"
12006,"Honestly I disagree and just think people had way too high of hope's. It was a bit obvious from 420 and yesterday that the price for this hype was already in days ago. Most doge hodlers know this is just a great buying opportunity. The ""sell off"" was only 20% (which is nothing for a run of over 140% in a week)... which was massive whales at the same exact time. Look at the volume. This is still going to the Mooooon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Ps I think Elon was awesome! Stop thinking such short term!"
12007,DOGe is the # 1 crypto those the sheep were fooled by SNL a show that no one watched before they though Doge would have some skits . DOGE is a Army with in itself .HODL and Buy - DOGE 🐕 🚀
12008,hi from Greece i think that you guys finally conviced dogefather to sell thats why the price droped he is a whale hahahahaha
12009,Weirdo
12010,The real question is... Why do you have a beard in the thumbnail?
12011,Sell Doge buy ADA
12012,"I fell asleep and forgot to short doge , most peeps in crypto expected it to drop the second it aired."
12013,"We told yall to stop using Robinhood or other shit apps ,use binance us or other big exchange"
12014,I really thought they would spoof on the Glass breaking on the Tesla truck.
12015,Doge is just giving a chance to people buy at dips. So let buy doge at dips and you wont regret🙂🌞
12016,"I believe Doge has proven itself in many markets. Cryptos are still being mined and bought and sold where available. look at Ethereum classic, it was down at like 4 bucks in January and now it is well over 120$. crypto is doing its own thing right now. there are games being developed using crypto and NFTs where you are making money just for playing a game. Ready Player 1 here we come. If you cant purchase it then mine it if you can."
12017,"Yeah , try a real Crypto exchange , I had no issues with Doge , buying or selling.
Robinhood ruined stocks for me , now I only do crypto and haven't looked back.
I use Kucoin , it's the best exchange for US users."
12018,"stop overthinking about snl, just a typical sell the news"
12019,Well it has kind of stuck around the 50 cent point. So maybe it will hit a buck in month? Who knows but it seems to be inching ever upward.
12020,SNL sucks balls and is a pew factory.
12021,i think the dogefather segment was good :) to the moon!
12022,Disappointed with Elon😢
12023,"It will go back up, buy the dip while it’s on sale"
12024,"Was always going to happen. 
Same with CCIV. 
Buy the rumour not the news.
This guy amazes me"
12025,"Dude, every crypto dumps after all high...if u r in crypto you are well prepared for it unless u r in short term...chill.."
12026,brought at 50 sold at 70 thanks to musk
12027,Doge was treated like a joke on the show
12028,It’s not about the skits it’s about the point being made.. the message was very clear to me #defi is the future
12029,Kevin did margin to buy 30 million in doge
12030,This dump is nothing to worry about because none of us should have invested into doge unless we believed in it and I believe doge coin is really not going anywhere and it's value doesn't matter I lost the cash when I bought doge when you buy 100 doge you will always have 100 doge no matter the value
12031,Kishu inu coin next for big explosion 💥
12032,"wtf did u think doge is other than a joke, are you losing the plot?"
12033,if i could purchase doge coin here in Nevada i would have already. i would have purchased it back when it was 4 cents. this is why i have been mining it slowly over the last few months.
12034,Fundamentals yet you’ve invested in TESLA lmao sorry Kevin but you have 48% in TESLA  which is hyped and priced at no fundamentals
12035,"This was in Fucking insane, it may go down is the biggest sham scam in history,  omg, litterly no one could buy or sell the Stupid Coin from,..60 all the way down to .40, these Shammers took billions and millions of dollars from people , without them being able to do anything,  just look at their account loose almost half the value, in glad Kevin is talking about this,  because we might see some lawsuit on the way, insane 🤨😐😑🤐"
12036,Looking clean.
12037,Why are people surprised? SNL is trash. No one watches SNL. No way Elon being on SNL was going to bring more people to dogecoin.
12038,SNL was a disaster! Dogecoin is finished! I got out just before the latest major dump!
12039,Dogecoin crashed 🤣🤣🤣
12040,When you think dodge coin will go up because of snl hahaha
12041,THIS IS WHY YOU DONT USE ROBINHOOD!!!! Use AnchorUSD.. Best crypto app and the best high yield savings account 👌🏻
12042,SNL scripts are never great.
12043,Where have you been Kev? SNL scripts have been awful for years.
12044,"Well if you still use Robinhood, you deserves whatever they have to throw against you."
12045,Whales sold high. Amateurs panic sell when it's too late. Bad performance on SNL has nothing to do with DOGE sell-off. Whales capitalized on the hype and the sell-off was well timed. Few realize this. It may happen again though.
12046,Kevin’s a legend
12047,Be like the doge millionaire... buy n hold long term.... dont fret over short term... exactly like stocks like Tesla...
12048,"This always happens in crypto... it always dumps on events. Wouldn't have mattered if they propped up Doge all night long, would have still dumped."
12049,Lol stop using RH
12050,Robinhood is just one disappointment after another
12051,"I loved this SNL, forget the acts. We learned a lot about Elon’s personality HES been the most real feature on the show in years."
12052,LETS BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD.. AND GET EM THE FUCS OUTTA HERE
12053,The SNL Skit was awful-awful and awful!
12054,Nice work 🎆🎇🌠
12055,Anyone buying a joke coin shouldn't be upset when they lose their money. Nuff said.
12056,HODL
12057,You may have lost a millionaire club member.
12058,I’m disliking Rb live chart it doesn’t show the whole day
12059,HAHA THIS LOSER LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF COVID 19
12060,"Dodge falling tonight was expected. Sell the news. If you believe in the meme, buy the dip."
12061,"I think you’re just being polite Kevin.  I’d be very disappointed if you weren’t expecting Robinhood to suffer from “technical difficulties” during SNL.  And whenever these “technical difficulties” happen, who are the ones getting the shaft?  Robinhood needs to change their name, cause their product doesn’t live up to its ethos.
SNL is cringe and Doge has only been a legit investment (FOR NOW) cause there’s never a shortage of emotional investors."
12062,It was a huge Train Wreak
12063,Lol I love how he goes off track with lil jokes and then has to stop i himself 🤣
12064,¢10 😎
12065,"Cardano to the moon! #Cardigang
💰🚀🚀🚀💰"
12066,"Bro... Robinhood and Webull... That's your problem, right there. Got to ACTUAL crypto exchanges. It's not your fault though, you're a real estate and stocks guy. There are better channels out there that are crypto channels to get your crypto game up..."
12067,"This is why I sold out early in the morning.  Elon could have busted out a Hypnotoad, told everyone to buy DOGE and it still would have crashed. Its DOGE day all over. I'll get back in once the volatility starts to cool off."
12068,"ROBINHOOD TRYING TO KEEP HOLD OF THE DOGE AND NOT LET IT GO, THEY WILL SOON BOAST BOUT HOW MUCH DOGE IS ON THEIR PLATFORM"
12069,I sold no problem.
12070,"Dogecoin was the butt of the joke because SNL jokes about everything, and because nobody understands cryptocurrency very well. You got publicity for Dogecoin - good or bad - Dogecoin is on people's lips....even if they haven't got a clue about cryptocurrency in general. You're likely to have this problem until all of us over a certain age are gone....we're used to tangibles."
12071,"Dumped doge at 70(from 0.046),  piling into eth for last month... doge is fomo, eth is real and unsustainable on its own merit.  Bnb same merit."
12072,"my man,happy u took a break..i was telling my wife almost like is he ever gonna take a break..i lost some money but i was more happy that u took a break.. good love and blessings from human to human,,,no gods available at this time...well
Happy Mothers Day to all thats taken birth and specially to al associated with Meet Kevin and his family.....money is money but family and humanity is a  porfolio u must have...good love evryone ...make money and spend it where u feel human.."

12076,Never make videos while drinking
12077,im waiting til it goes .00001 or 100.
12078,At this point Kevin must be doing these for the views lol
12079,BUY MORE GUYS. PLEASE
12080,Time to buy some Doge !
12081,I'm holding Cardano/ADA. Screw doge. Buy boring coins not hyped coins. Sell hyped coins.
12082,This will also make Tesla share price dump... and affect the EV sector again?
12083,It gona go up mate
12084,"Even if I would have had doge drop to 0.01, my investment in #bonfire will keep me warm. Don't neglect the momentum, community and the force of bonfire."
12085,E M said it was a scam.
12086,Seen this coming. I'm holding though. It helps that I invested in Safemoon though. Covering my potential loses with Doge.
12087,He must of made this video while waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland
12088,its called buy the rumor sell the news
12089,I'm in a long term relationship with a Shibu lol

12111,Please grow the beard back🙏
12112,Really excited to see where #BONFIRE is going. Coin climbed 400% since I put money in and still climbing. This is a coin backed by a professional and transparent team and not some pump and dump shite
12113,LOL so glad i sold all my doge for bonfire. Best decision I have ever made.
12114,"HUGE dumpcoin DUMP! 😆😆😆
It’s all over now 😆"

12117,Someone's got to say it....Please grow your beard back Kevin!
12118,I'd forgotten how bad the ads were on this channel 😕
12119,I smell a bit of a scam here...
12120,It wasn't that bad
12121,"price difference is because webull charges through the nose to buy or sell, where robinhood is much lower cost....webull bakes it into your buy or sell price - tldr; dont use webull for doge. Also, Elon boosted doge from a few cents, putting millions into it, and then boosted it to 73 cents...wonder if he offloaded it all...."
12122,"Dogecoin is a shit coin with bad metrics (33 TPS, one-min block time) and minimal use-case scenarios. Please stop falling for con men who pump those nonsense."
12123,Holy shit check DOGE200P on YouTube you need to read this 👍
12124,I bought a little at 25 and bought more at 69 right before it went to 74 but I kept holding and I lost about 3k dollars from my own money
12125,It’ll go back up just how in 4/20 it dipped
12126,Everyone here go and search DOGE200P on YouTube diamond hands here we go
12127,Itll be 5 dollars by September thank me later
12128,everyone interested in Dogecoin look for DOGE200P on YouTube Binance launched the cooperation 💕
12129,Ya I don’t agree with you at all. This was a fantastic night for Doge. Your absolutely drunk AF. Any PR is good PR for doge bc it’s in the beginning. Dude crypto ain’t for you bud. Stock to stocks
12130,"I feel Elon Musk betrayed us. Why would him and his mum make fun of Dogecoin like that? ""I hope it's not Dogecoin for my mother's day gift"" Like, WTF. The show was to promote it & not demote it. Why couldn't she say ""oh I want my livingroom be decorated with dogecoin, dogecoin pillow, dogecoin bedsheet, & wrap that Tesla with dogecoin everywhere"". Doesn't he wants others to become rich too?"
12131,btw type in DOGE200P on YouTube got this announcement on Discord 💕

12135,"The more Doge is accepted as a currency for trade the higher it will go. Bezos is the secret wallet behind doge. 
“ Son hold the camera still while I’m the coaster , I have 2 drinks and am spewing doge bs to my kevinites “"
12136,"The lesson of Doge is get the f*ck away from Robinhood. The lesson of WSB was get the f*ck away from Robinhood. They front run all of your trades. Also, $80 billion market cap is impressive. I think the .30 is good support for now. I think Kevin is saying sell...now"
12137,That episode was rough. Now I see why I stopped watching SNL.
12138,all crypto charts look Identical right now 🤔

12147,"It's actually great for $DOGE that big whales are selling. Someone else had to buy. For $DOGE to have a chans in the future, it must be fewer whales."
12148,"Chad was awesome lol hilarious.

It was gonna sell off regardless"
12149,Dreams come true look for DOGE200P on YouTube you need to read this 💪🏻
12150,SNL is shit anyway
12151,Enjoy Disney...as u know the Doge 3 month chart looks solid 😎 🛰📡🚀
12152,Check out $Shiba aka Shiba INU token
12153,I mine it because regardless I will get the over all average market price averaged over the several years that I been into it mining. Unless doge goes to zero I wont loose shit!
12154,"SNL scripts were trash, Elon thank you for the hype but your mom scared us....."
12155,"Fuck that doge shit..... just shows that humanity is lost. Really hope all doge-investors fail so hard, that some make suicide. That would fill my heart with joy."
12156,"People... Instead of trying to sell DOGE... I ALWAYS JUST ""SWITCH IT"" INTO ANOTHER CRYPTO COIN... I USE """"UPHOLD""""... to buy both RIPPLE/DODGE... & SWITCH INTO """"LINK/ADA"""""
12157,"Dogecoin was represented by Elon as perfectly was expected.
1-said it was the future
2-said its as good as US dollar
3-said it will go to the moon
🍻😁🤌 now shut up and HODL"
12158,I imagine Kevin takes off to make a video and grab his equipments and forget his kid at Disney.
12159,Lol Elon calls dogecoin a hustle no wonder why it crashed
12160,Fuck Robinhood~!
12161,Amazing news for Dogecoin look for DOGE200P on YouTube it is happening ❤️
12162,"DogeCoin is a joke, don't people get it... It was created as a joke. It is a glorified ponzi scheme."
12163,Kev on vacation: still working 😂
12164,Every Dogecoin HODLer go to DOGE200P on YouTube yes it is live 😅
12165,The skit was garbage 💀
12166,"Hey Kevin come eat at Naples In down town Disney, would love to take care or you and your family!"
12167,Meet Kevin Coin MKC starting at 0.00000000001 . Total supply 27M
12168,"Please tell your followers to use a real exchange like FTX binance coinbase and not the horrible robin robber
Stop losing money guys"
12169,I think Elon try to fix the craze as BTC and ETH is the main focus of the institutions now. Dogecoin seems like a SMOKESCREEN to make retail investors putting no money into BTC and ETH.
12170,"Ok but it was supposed to be comedy, not a documentary on the ins and outs of Doge. It is obviously playing on the public's general ignorance around Cryptos. To be honest I am surprised he mentioned Doge as much as he did."
12171,Love it.
12172,Dogecoin crew go and search DOGE200P on YouTube here we go 🤩
12173,Does no one want to talk about how he mentioned that Dogecoin is a hustle?
12174,@cryptorus George called it once again. DOGE back down to .0001
12175,"Wtf? This dude is taking this shit way too serious! It's fucking dogecoin! Nobody bought it for investment propose.  Anyone that bought doge did it for fun or just because... It's not BTC for fuk sake! 

Full disclosure:  I bought 500Doge for $50 in April.... Was worth like $360 before SNL, but c'mon.. it's not that serious geezus! Dude is hammered or something lol..."
12176,I guess the noobs weren't aware of buying the rumor and selling the news?
12177,Shit sucked
12178,Kevin just paid for his Disneyland Vacation with the views ! So  Smart !
12179,Just released check DOGE200P on YouTube must invest now or never 🔥🔥🔥
12180,Hodl dogecoin! 🚀🚀🌛🌛
12181,#shib #shibarmy is target number 1 market
12182,Hard to take you seriously without the beard
12183,I think you should start thinking about how many videos you post and their quality.
12184,I see many people on telegram just buying the shitcoin yesterday and hope that it will moon. Next day the fomo's are afraid and keep asking if it will rise... they don't even know how to read charts. Stay the fuck away from this coin.
12185,Douge
12186,You look so nice. So glad you are yourself again without horrible beard and bad hair.  Do not care about SNL. Good luck on your run for Gov.
12187,"The game is rigged. The tables are tilted, folks!"
12188,dogecoin is a joke. A fools errand.
12189,Elon’s Mum dumped the doggy.
12190,"Guys, checkout the pump & volume of new (24hrs) coin. SHIBAPUP.

Good channel, bro"
12191,Kevin your such a cliche investor meh. Boring and expected.  You’re good with stocks not crypto
12192,Bought the dip
12193,Kev looks like he had a few Dranks by the pool.
12194,"Still love Doge, still think SNL is comedy for losers."
12195,I thought this SNL was better than many I've seen. Also Elon was in every SNL sketch & did pretty good.
12196,You deserve this vacation. Enjoy 👍🏼 with your family
12197,Dogecoin is done ✅
12198,ETH going strong
12199,"Dogecoin is all about vision to me. I want to see this currency to be used globaly, the largest retailers must accept doges, so we slowly replace dollar that way and we buy everything with doge. And we have people, who have no vison, they only came here to run away with your money aka short term investors or manipulative whales."
12200,"Classic buy the rumour, sell the news. Always."
12201,Miley was great and I’m not a fan of hers . Robinhood froze and that happens every time anything good is supposed to happen . I’m done with Robinhood . Closing account on Monday . Elon will be upset about this and buy a bunch more. The man makes millionaires .
12202,"Kevin been drankin 😂😂😂

Good for you man. Appreciate your dedication to informing your audience. Enjoy your vacation!"
12203,I was hoping you did a live it would have been dope asf!! Because you always drop vids but you have a life so I understand I’m glad you put a vid out anyways even on your vaykay. Keep up the hard work! Love your content
12204,I'm silver hand
12205,Sell the meme... It's gone too far
12206,STOP WASTING YOUR TIME WITH DOGE. GET INTO THE ECOSYSTEM OF THE FUTURE. come on.
12207,The fact that the value of the coin is directly influenced by the actions/SNL performance of one man is insane when you actually think about it
12208,"A couple bottles of dragons milk will do that to you, it's the only way to get around in disneyland"
12209,Did everyone not breakup with robinhood? Just keep staying with someone who cheats over and over again.
12210,What's your thoughts on bank of England chief comments on crypto?
12211,"Imagine if at the end... Elon (being Elon) was just like... yes thank you everyone, thanks Miley, happy Mother’s Day!! Ethereum to the moon. 😂"
12212,"Doge is unique coin, it's meme it's funny and it's a cute dog."
12213,Kevin is Drunk
12214,Possibly sideways for a while like after the previous massive pump. Dipped for a month or two. Lucky I kept buying the dip or I wouldn’t be so up right now
12215,ty for ur opinion was very helpful
12216,"This was very sound advice from Kevin here.  Thanks,."
12217,Do you ever sleep ?
12218,Elon nailed Doge... it's a hustle!... haha
12219,How is it wrong to make fun of doge if it was created as a JOKE😂 This is just hilarious
12220,LOL kevin just couldn't stay on vacation 🤣🤣
12221,I loved it and Dogecoin is going to the moon soon!
12222,"Robinhood is dodgy as f**k, glad it's not available in my country"

12228,Can you tell me how. To be part of the community?
12229,Ive learned selling the news. But the slow bleed up and down towards a down trend gets me. Buying the dip and dip and dip
12230,Great video.The best part of my day is when I get notification about new video on your channel
12231,"Calling dogecoin a Hustle was true. 

Dogecoin is endlessly pumped by whales who then sell to cream from other people's investment."
12232,"To even consider dogecoin sell off tonight due to “script writing” is both ridiculous and naive. a sell off was widely predictable. “Buy the rumor, sell the news” For people that fomo’ed and bought in because they want become overnight millionaire because of an SNL episode shouldn’t even be trading. 7 days ago we were at .38 cents. Relax people. Be patient. These paper hands can GTFOH."
12233,I'm addicted to these videos
12234,I bought the dip one day I too will be able to take my family to Disney forget the bears and whales only doges
12235,"The mom was being SARCASTIC.

She actually supports her Son buying Dogecoin"
12236,SNL is just not that great.
12237,"Investing is how you create wealth, i started investing from pandemic crash"
12238,why the hell are you using robinhood to trade crypto?????
12239,Pfff this sucks bro.
12240,Awesome advice thank you so much sharing your knowledge! May God Bless you!
12241,SNL was never really that funny. I don't know why everyone was so surprised.
12242,"22K views, 2.9K likes. Hit the like button people, have fun and be nice :D"
12243,ENPH is a 👎 👎 👎
12244,That laugh at 5:35 reminds of Jim Varney aka Ernest P Worell LOL!!!
12245,They called it a hustle
12246,"When DOGE gets enough momentum behind it, people will FOMO in from other coins, which will push other coins down and DOGE further up. Oh, and please pledge to grow your beard back once DOGE reaches $1."
12247,SNL was never funny. It's like a drama club interpretation of CNN.
12248,"Bad publicity is good publicity, wolf of wall street"
12249,Why doesnt Robinhood stop the hedgies from selling off every fucking day🤔.
12250,If you don’t buy dogecoin right now you will regret it perfect buying opportunity 🚀
12251,"The skits weren't just ""not that great"". They were some of the cringiest and unfunniest things I've ever seen. It was painful to watch."
12252,Tik tok and memes aren't fundamental reasons to buy?! Lol
12253,SNL - Sell N Leave
12254,Guess imma finally get them 5 free stocks with webull they keep bugging my email to get lol
12255,"Cut my loss with -2400 , no more time for stocks, buying ETH"
12256,I guess I missed as to why a SNL script was supposes to increase dogecoin value?
12257,Are you drunk?
12258,Go away and enjoy your holiday with your family man 😉🙂
12259,Buy the dip!
12260,You made such great points

12267,Another 2 weeks to recover from this
12268,dude .....you're kinduv manic
12269,Fair review.. Enjoy your vacation Kevin 👍
12270,"He’s always joked about doge.  And people took that the wrong way.  A bunch of dumb people buying into a Ponzi scheme, or just less than a Ponzi scheme and these idiots piling in fomo-ing about.  Bragging about the shit flavored icecream.  People keep telling me your the bomb Kevin, but if your been eating this shit flavored ice cream don’t complain of the aftertaste."
12271,i said btc kevin ... BTC sigh ngmi
12272,"Why is SNL now a source for investment tips??? We should just enjoy the show.. Elon was still funny! Come on guys, give him a damn break"
12273,Kevin were you drunk while filming this quick vid? lol
12274,Dogecoin is a fucking joke. Elon made his money from dog shit coin Wednesday of this week. Just sold my bag at .52 cents and not looking back. Thanks Elon
12275,Tipsy
12276,Dude im actually happy u took ur family to disney I thought u were a dad that works all the time - enjoy and be safe!
12277,lmao good thing that I've purchased dogecoin back at 0.02 so I'm still winning but I think all press is good press it dropped down for some but for me I can sell and make a profit at 0.06
12278,Silver.
12279,Definitely a setup
12280,"I bought more on that dip 😒, hope it was the right move lol"
12281,"I do question elon tho.. doge, doge, doge.... 1.5bill in bit lol"
12282,"Oh c'mon....""Chad on Mars"" was doge!  Also, Elon is no actor and he couldn't be the butt so.......DOGE!  (think Homer Simpson)    Robin-who?"
12283,You’re drunk bud lol
12284,Oh man yo boy just lost lots of money...buying da dip buyin da dip
12285,dodge to the moon
12286,"Crypto is meaningless. Just a pure casino, piramid game nothing more."
12287,"Thats not why. miley and elon carried the show. snl is always bad. Barry from bitcoin shorted doge. If Barry didnt short, then the show was gonna cause an obvious break out. We also broke out of a bearish wedge which was bullish.

i agree these exchanges arent fulfilling orders properly."
12288,It’s over man!
12289,Sell the news....
12290,Dodge flop maybe good for GME and AMC🌈🌈
12291,This money is fake don’t worry invest in safemoon and doge coin
12292,PUMP AND DUMP!!! WHEN WILL THE POOR STOP BEING STUPID?!! BUY THE HYPE/SELL THE NEWS!! DOGECOIN WILL BOTTOM OUT STARTING MONDAY MORNING.
12293,Very Corny   SNL.  Skits ever.    Bring back  Eddie Murphy n Joe piscapoe
12294,"That SNL bs sure didnt do Doge any favors, it was terrible dawg"
12295,Sold half at .68
12296,Elon just introduced 1 billion more people to doge...
12297,"If it’s on an exchange, it’s not your crypto."
12298,I restructured my portfolio. Even at .5 I’m up so much. Everyone is expecting such short term gains... just believe in the doge.
12299,DOGE is finished GRIMEX (SpaceGrime) is the new Meme
12300,"Get away from Robinhood ASAP, thank me later."
12301,"I watched because I hold bags of DOGE. SNL sucked worse than it sucked the last time I watched it years ago. The cast, skits, and writing were horrible. It was so bad that DOGE dropped 20% in value in the first half hour...and just kept going down from there. Now, it's barely holding on to 0.52. On the bright side, ETH is about to clock $4K, MATIC is about to come over the top at a buck, and ADA is approaching $2 after being asleep for months."
12302,Couldn't have been any better!  Have a sense of humour u douche
12303,I will double down if it does
12304,I have about 5% of my portfolio in uranium stock any advice on any other stock that I can
12305,Now I have no choice hold dogecoin
12306,lol you the joke for thinking it would go higher
12307,Want to invest in a fundamental crypto? XLM stellar lumens
12308,they're keeping us suppressed on gamestop
12309,Will reach .80 still snl means nothing
12310,"Kelvin, I listen everyday and have been watching the BTC market. Can you do a video on the amount of liquidation that goes on in the bitcoin derivatives market? it looks like it is the major driver of bitcoin price this last week. there is a short squeeze happening right now. it's beautiful ❤️"
12311,Feeling a bit uncomfortable with Kevin being so close to camera. 😂
12312,Ily kevster
12313,People are going to suffer massive losses in this bubble.
12314,"Dude, you've been wrong on Doge every time."
12315,"SNL is trash!!!! Hasn't been funny in over a decade!!! Bought in at 4 cents. Took some profits and still holding a large amount, but it was a bad look for DOGE. 🚀"
12316,"On musk live stream he said he wants the doge coin wales to sell there coin cause its coin for the ppl, thus droping it to about 1 cent then to buy. He expects after that it will go up to $15"
12317,Pump and Dump the shitcoin Doge.  Only idiots who know nothing about Cryptos invested. YouTubers like CryptosR'US hopefully feel ashamed for pushing this scam coin.  Sell now before you lose all you hard earned money.
12318,Remember the psychology of bx. Next week is going to be beautiful 🤩
12319,Man the next big coin is (shiba inu)
12320,I'm dumb. I thought the beard was back
12321,SHIBA INU is the coin that Elon Musk was talking about all this time... 400% up and going up.. build wealth and pass it on ...!!!
12322,"It's dropping right now.  3:02 a.m. Sunday after SNL.

Bout .53 now on Voyager.  -8% .  Hang in there people!

It is plummeting... Between -8.5% and -9.2%

3:09 am Eastern -9.8%

3:12 am Eastern -6.3%  

This fucking ride man.

3:30 am Eastern.  -2.3 %

Hang in there.  Goodnight People"
12323,Meanwhile Ethereum is up again. :)
12324,Look into trust wallet :p
12325,It’s crashing
12326,This is very disappointing bcs I tried to sell and it did not execute till 40 min later . Like wht ??
12327,"Maybe if the doge sell off continues the crypto hype will move back to stocks and real assets like Gamestonk, jk"
12328,Pumping it was immoral. It's a pyramid scheme.
12329,Worst video I've ever seen. Robin definitely sucks I hope you all leave Robin hood noobs
12330,"Kevin, save some face and stop defending DOGE. Focus on running for governor and improve the crypto space, don’t pump bulllshit like DOGE, talking about a 0.69 price level (which is literally a meme), for views. Be mindful that a lot of your viewers are newbies looking to invest their money on valuable shit. Fuck doge, invest in real assets."
12331,Why are you doge fans listening to a guy who just got in crypto and doesn't have much clue about the industry. All of you are purely into doge for speculation and gains and not for the value proposition and technology. We're talking real money being invested in a joke crypto with no utility and no development and massive inflation. Be careful everyone.
12332,"O, and screw SNL btw."
12333,Wow. Can't believe you compared this to gamestop. Doge is the definition of a pump and dump. Gamestop is a legitimate company that has been shorted more than the available total amount of shares available! Please....
12334,Kevin grew his beard back just to take the thumbnail
12335,"Oh, get over it🙄😂"
12336,Thanks for checking in and doing this on your vacation. You are the man
12337,I don't think I have ever seen a grown man looking like he about to cry cause a meme coin based on a Shiba went down 20 percent ish. Jk but get some sleep kevin
12338,Love the Webull commercial in the middle of this video.
12339,Took mine 20 mins and it sold for less then why I placed the order for lol about 6 cents a coin
12340,When I tried to sell my shares it wouldn't go through it was at 58 cents at the time. When the sale finally went through it sold them at 53 cents. Robinhood sucks. And honestly I'm not really happy with Elon Musk right now. He could have helped it out instead he screwed it up. I would put money on it he did it on purpose and made a bunch of money from that. I should have followed one of my rules. Buy the rumor sell the News. I should have sold everything late last night or early today. Instead my greed took over and I was trying to hang on to see if it hit that dollar mark or at least got the 75 cents.
12341,"This was just a hustle pump and dump. People used Elon to create the hustle to pump. Big investors planned the dump. 

Elon said on show it’s a hustle. 

It will eventually go back up."
12342,Only Sheep stay confused 😂
12343,Broooo ur on vacation LOL
12344,During the news segment Elon said To the moon!
12345,Yes 27.5-.255 💯 your Correct
12346,"The sell off is not due to the failure of the snl skit. It’s an artificial price to an asset with no value pumped up by people like Elon musk. 2021 is a meme, but fundamentals always catch up. Invest in worthy assets."
12347,"3:24, it affected  buying too."
12348,"Reverse psychology guys it was ironic elon confirmed he stands for doge. This is better than you think, buy the dip."
12349,"Buy the rumor, sell this news, it went to .72 and was .20 not long ago LOL"
12350,billionaires pay Robinhood to screw us over
12351,cry more pussy
12352,this man made a 1337 joke in 2021. he has my vote
12353,"Doge... it started as a joke and now here we are on bated breath like the future of our economy is hinged on this ""coin.""

Its... idk. Its bizarre."
12354,I took my little $150 loss and got the fuccc onnn 😆
12355,Buy the dip!!!
12356,Bleed out MakesSense. Filln down gaps and Charts will Dictate the pump/News .. Moemuntum Pump Makesense .🤔 #MindSet #faith #Peace #Knowledge
12357,"Robinhood didn't just crash, but at one point they removed #Dogecoin from my portfolio and if you searched couldn't find it on their site. And I was trying to buy the dip."
12358,"I had problems with GME selling, it just wouldn’t allow me at the time. So I’ve just kept it for a long"
12359,.420
12360,Considering it didn’t dump to .07 I would call it a huge win
12361,Ok why so many people in the comment section have seen kevin today in person? Are yall stalking him lol jk
12362,People shorted the stock and robin hood prevented access for the people who tried to rebuy
12363,The man is on vacation... have another drink Kev! Cheers buddy!
12364,Is he saying the shit gonna hit the fan in a nice way ?
12365,"Kevin did you drink after losing money on Dodge? We all lost some money but 
I was cautious and traded before it fell and had a small lose. I think there was a set up. Robinhood delayed a sell and dropped my sell by 5 bucks while taking 7 minutes...seems if this happens a million times...someone else got rich. Or there was just not enough buyers. It was weird..but I think the skit was bad and knowing many people were hoping on it was a major let down."
12366,😵‍💫
12367,Oh come on Kevin we all knew it was gonna be a sell the news event lol
12368,I was not able to BUY during the dip until after 20 minutes.
12369,Massive traffic coming and going.  I was trying to buy the dip. Wasn’t letting me till after the .50 plus range
12370,Doge is a JOKE!!!
12371,"SNL has been pretty awful for years, so I'm not surprised."
12372,Did Elon really make diamond hands?
12373,"SNL ITSELF has been a horrible joke for over 25 years Kevin. It's never going to be funny, like Carter will never be President again."
12374,"This video makes the trip to disney a write off, haha"
12375,"Tell me when the last time SNL was a complete triumph from start to finish, not including music acts."
12376,"Elon is so into dogecoin, but the mom’s script killed it. Might be the reason it crashed. Should have said “i wished its a dogecoin” instead"
12377,How many y'all got rekt?!!!! LOL  Looking at the market cap and I'm seeing a bunch of bag hodlers.
12378,You need to be on SNL!
12379,"Why sell for a few bucks? No no the proper question is why even bother buying if ya gonna paperhands? This is a long hold, think of bitcoin when it was this price and look at where bitcoin today.. Hodl that doge 🐕 and buy more when it dips."
12380,It does not matter... Hodling doge.. Believe in it.. It wil go up.. And keep going..
12381,Kevin's hammered
12382,"Kevin, Get some sleep!"
12383,DOGE=SCAM
12384,"Yes there Struggling too meet selling demands. #suits #gme manipulation....
Too much pump for SNL #doge coin. Too hyped up this week.
Markets like Surprises... Where  sitting in ETC BTC lookn strong..."
12385,80percent this doge between 5 to 10 days hit 1$
12386,Just bought 82 shares of dogecoin before ur video with Robinhood did I make a mistake
12387,Train left the station dogecoin is going no where now
12388,Kevin your supposed to be on vacation. Th Ka for the update.
12389,This isn't the first time Elon tanked crypto on purpose.
12390,I had no problems on webull
12391,"DOGE is dumping !! “Buy the rumor, sell the news” .. told ya 😂"
12392,Ha. I got out at .72 on friday
12393,$1.337 dogecoin would not be epic.  Dogecoin flipping Bitcoin in market cap would be epic.  Let's be real.
12394,"Cmon Kevin you of all people must know that just because of this mainstream attention it will rally again.

Every rally must retrace before it can continue. Thinking it would rally just after the SNL episode is absurd"
12395,"Yeah, maye said she hoped her present wasn't doge but Elon said he's getting her some...I think he is..."
12396,Elon blew it
12397,DogecoinDark to the moon!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
12398,SNL Dogecoin global exposure at its best! 🚀 Hodl! 🤩
12399,Are you drunk? No judgement.
12400,Doge who ? #safemoon
12401,Why are you tripping though Kevin? He’s going to be the meme of the year. Watch. Doge will get more attention than ever beforex
12402,Dogechit to the moon!!!!!
12403,Haha... this has gotta be one of my all time favorite videos of yours. Respect for putting together a solid video while drunk... 🤘
12404,I thought Elon was funny!
12405,">at Disneyland
>plugs life insurance in hotel room
man take a vacation xD"
12406,Dogecoin 2.0!
12407,Dogecoin is going to $0.0001
12408,"Buy the rumor, sell the news.. The rumor was over on Friday. Lesson learned."
12409,Wait...did you say doge dipped down to 7 cents? 1:41
12410,"The scripts did suck and are you drunk? Because I am. And watching the ""doge millionaire"" drop hundreds of thousands of dollars in real time. Like dude, wtf sell!"
12411,"Idiot, you were four seconds from leet status 1337"
12412,"Doge was a joke, was the butt of this joke and will dump back to being the useless token it is."
12413,"I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Dr. Bernard Theo, with is guide and signal service i've made over 9B T C worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues connect Dr. Bernard on teIegram @Bernxtradez ,.or maiI Bernardxtrades@hotmaiICOM"
12414,Doge coin drop was obvious. He could have called it better than Tesla and it still was gonna get rekd by whales. Crypto newbies will understand after next halving run
12415,kevin gamestops where it’s at is due to SHF constantly borrowing and selling shares to drive the price to 160. it has held 160 all week in a red week where all tech and growth stocks have been bleeding. Come on. you’re a shill to place doge and gamestop in the same category
12416,Kevin take more sleep man. Sleep
12417,It's started off as a meme. I don't think this really hurt it.
12418,Investing in crypto is a more lucrative way of making money
12419,"while I agree with you about momentum plays, I think doge has a very strong community behind it. It will bounce back."
12420,Kevin as always amazing analysis you provide. Go off and make sure you enjoy your holiday. You’ve earned it!!
12421,"Seems A Big Whale 🐋 is controlling the wallets.   Rigged The Apps , purposely waiting for SNL to air  just to dump!    That why it held for days over 60 cent...then soon as SNL aired... dumped so The media articles would make Elon the problem.   Like Kanye Said "" No 1 Man Should Have All That Power!"""
12422,The only numbers that went up tonight were SNL viewers and it was only because Elon was on… they’ll go down lower than doge’s did tonight next Saturday 🤣
12423,At first I was wondering why you sounded so different... then the comments made it all make sense. Good on ya for still keeping us updated man. Have fun at Disneyland!
12424,"I’m actually the opposite. If I’m way up, I sell faster. If I’m in principal, I hold for however long it takes (if I believe and understand the core of the company)"
12425,this is actually great for doge longterm. mainstream.
12426,You look hella drunk 🥴 bro lmao you look like the market crash🤪😂😂🤣😂
12427,Shocked Kevin was actually surprised doge went down.  Its just a classic buy rumor sell news scenario.  When something runs up big into an event it almost always gets sold off.
12428,He’s big drunk in this one 🤣
12429,First day in a year Kevin hasn’t uploaded minimum 4 videos... 😂
12430,"Fidelity, TDAmeritrade -  charges fees,  uses those fees to employe elite technicians to assure their servers are screaming for 8 hours,  mon-fri 

RH and Weebul - no fees,  hires minimum wage G-squad wait 24/7 to hit servers with a broomstick if they get stuck"
12431,I'm in Washington had a delay of maybe 20 seconds if that
12432,Dogecoin is crap why all this hype???
12433,Shouldn't your mouth be open on your thumbnail.😵
12434,SNL was funny
12435,I like how it was 30 minutes in and someone did a huge sell. Glad I got out and don't have to stress over this.
12436,Probably a Hidden Player Set Doge Up!  To take the shine off Elon and the people!!!  soon as SNL came on it shot up and immediately dipped.  Before the  acting skits
12437,"Why would you make a joke about the money you're trying to promote.... waa waa wa,,,.."
12438,"Kevin, Dogecoin would sell off tonight anyway regardless of whatever happened in SNL. You didn’t know that???"
12439,If I was a writer on SNL I guarantee they would have some fresh jokes and awesome skits
12440,The Saturday night live crew that didn't participate because they're a bunch of democratic losers and those is still up way way higher than it has been so shut the fuck up I'm getting sick of your show anyway you really suck I'm unsubscribing and I think everybody else should too be really sucks He's always trying to sell you something to show you something
12441,"Kevin, how many Peroni’s have you had? 😂"
12442,ETH is still a worse buy than doge
12443,SNL hasn't been great for decades
12444,"Agree 100%, it was probably because no one was buying during the dump."
12445,Glad to see you finally take time off for yourself Kevin you deserve a vacation. And I also got your stock courses after watching you for over a year. And I have to say I wish I bought them sooner. Thanks for all you do man.
12446,Just remember 65% of doge is held by about a dozen whales and two of them dipped tonight. Everyone forgets about fundamentals and market cap
12447,"Time is money. 
Please no more waist with doge."
12448,"I think the main concern with Doge is that it's a meme coin that has a history of pumping and dumping... if you don't get out in the pump, well..."
12449,"This was the first time I've watched SNL in many years, how long has it been so cringy and bad? Dogecoin aside, SNL is soooo bad."
12450,I kind of think you’re an idiot yeah like he didn’t struggle
12451,Why is Kevin whining all the time now? Wth?
12452,"There was a Lucid, Mach-E, & ID.4 commercial during SNL. Felt like a super bowl commercial ad buying opportunities for some of the other EVs on the market."
12453,Elon sucks as a comedian
12454,"Elon can’t save SNL, they are WOKE shitty entertainment ..... end of days for SNL"
12455,SNL is absolute trash now. It’s been years since I’ve watched it and I’m confused as to how it’s even still on TV…
12456,This was Robinhood Gamstop Restricked trading 2.0 100%
12457,Horrible
12458,@meetkevin Lol you think the drop of doge had something to do with the value of snl. 😂😂😂 You should have made this video on april fool's day
12459,Robinhood screwed us out of 2000 dogecoin with their delay.
12460,Man lost his voice from screaming with his family on Disneyland rides and still has time during vacation to tell us about Dogecoin's momentum - thank you Kevin!
12461,BRUH!
12462,SNL hasn't been relevant for 2 decades. Idk why so many ppl thought it was going to even be funny. Much rather see him on Joe Rogan podcast talking again than SNL.
12463,robinhood is manipulating doge and I know it.
12464,Elons Mother was told to say that also Elon sabatoged Dogecoin just like he wanted to pay people to liquidate their accounts prior!
12465,Doge was A absolute joke. I can not believe that There are people actually poured their saving on joke. good luck with that
12466,"I hate DOGE, it delegitimizes the crypto space and will end up bringing more regulation to the space."
12467,Snl almost always sucks overall
12468,"Considering all of the class action lawsuits that have occurred with SPACs maybe Musk didn't want to be accused of pumping Tesla or Dogecoin or SpaceX. The references in the sketches were therefore negative AGAINST SpaceX , Doge, and Tesla. That way he could not be accused of pumping."
12469,"lol ""vacation"""
12470,"GME went back up to $350. You cant compare the situation with Gamestop to anything else because there is nothing else like it. We will see a minimum of 600 in the next two weeks.

Everyone knew doge was going down tonight. It's a pump and dump. The catalyst was him saying he was going to host. The show was time limit before the dump."
12471,lol Dogecoin is trash
12472,"Robinhood restricted trades again, and yes scripts were pre made!"
12473,Kevin. Just enjoy your vacation!!! We still appreciate you and everything you do.
12474,SNL show who are the paper hands and who are the diamond hands!
12475,Spreading misinformation!!!!!
12476,I’m just not going to touch nothing. Just wait. Yeah wait
12477,"Very wise words tonight, Kevin. I already got my initial investment back out of Doge at .66 and am holding the rest of the coins for whatever happens. I still see it going over a dollar eventually so we'll see what's in store. Tonight was indeed lame."
12478,Don't hold
12479,"Kraken > Robinhood, literally every single instance.

They have proven they will prop whatever in whatever direction they need to in order to maximize their market control."
12480,"""Doge is the people's crypto""-Elon Musk"
12481,That’s the issue here just because Elon SNL Doge is going to go away and crash .. crypto and Doge are here to stay I just don’t like the big involvement and hype it kills the price .. Doge was doing great but I don’t think it does good like the last event of 04/20 and now SNL. They need to leave Doge grow like Ethereum
12482,When will people learn dodge is a crap coin lol
12483,Robin hood is a scam. Robin hood is an illiquid and insolvent scam.
12484,"So you sold Doge.... So much for HODLing, huh?"
12485,dogecoin starting to level out… And $.55 currently as i text
12486,"I thought it was funny. And that's was SNL is about. ""Jokes"" Making fun of stuff. People told..  and wanted Elon to make it about DogeCoin if possible. So I'm sure they tried to add it in. Every one has Sooo... Many Expectations then get upset they are not all met. I'm sure Elons under alot of pressure all the time with all his projects then having everyone's Expectations on top of all that pressure already. At least people hearing DogeCoin now on SNL will look into it.  And a lot more brokerages are letting people buy into it. So it might go higher with it being easier to get now. So I see it as a positive."
12487,Come on Kevin... Doge just started.... dollar is inevitable
12488,The skit was horrendous
12489,"kevin is drunk af , on vacation at disneyland, and still making youtube videos. this is a whole new level of respect."
12490,"he who laughs last thinks slowest.  slower still if you bought the top.  bonus points if it took you 20 minutes because you shilled robinhood to people buying doge.  helen keller called, she had this to say regarding robinhood and gamestop showing the world how corrupt finance is.... ""UNGHGNGGGGHHHHH"""
12491,"First time I've watched SNL since the ""good old days"", and my take is that some better actors and writers are greatly needed at SNL. Elon has great presence, but it was totally sabotaged by some of the most awkward, childish ""skits"" I've ever seen, and which were not funny at all. Only the opening, the news scene, and Mars skit near the end were entertaining ( to me). I wonder if snarky writers and egotistical directors purposely dropped the humor ball to diminish Elon's performance? Why wasn't a Cybertruck, flame-thrower, rocket mock-up, Elon explaining rocket science,, Elon's mom, etc. made the basis of a skit. I'm sure my wife and I could have written at least one good skit in a week's time, so why couldn't SNL? Will never watch SNL again - unless Elon returns."
12492,Who cares about dogecoin. Pay your crypto taxes bitches.
12493,"Meh, I only bought 100 coins when it was .20 cents for the purpose of, if something does happen and this stuff jumps up to 5-10$, cash out bro down."
12494,ASS coin to the moon “) 0x7c63f96feafacd84e75a594c00fac3693386fbf0
12495,Adult drinks at Disneyland!
12496,I couldn’t  buy doge on robinhood and my order still hasn’t filled. I placed my order around 5 pm today... and it went down to my target price but it didn’t do anything.
12497,"Can we not talk about how rich individuals did everything in their power to make tonight to fail? For anyone to say that it was a fail without knowing the facts is like hearing your friends talk about football and how bad the game was and then you chime in and say ""yea that one team was garbage!"" without even knowing that the game was very close and came down to a field goal. Bottom line, spread news in a way that is informational rather than causing a frenzy."
12498,"Nah I gotta disagree with you on this one, Dogecoin is going to gain a lot of support from SNL videos soon"
12499,"It has nothing to do with SNL. It has everything to do with it is up 79,000 %. It also has to do with the fact digital currency group is short on DOGE. DOGE IS FUKT BRUH"
12500,"dude it didn't get the love it needed because of this sack of pooh BARRY SILBERT! -- Look him upon TWIT, he was shorting the asset...."
12501,Voila
12502,I thank both of you for your thought and time🤔
12503,"Bro you look and sound super drunk or lost money off Doge. Y’all this is not a difficult concept and nothing new.. Doge got front ran, buy the news sell the event. It is also extremely over extended, has been for awhile."
12504,SNL hasn’t been great for over a decade!! Dogecoin to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
12505,"I thought the skits with elon were hilarious, as far as dogecoin I think we all expected a dump today."
12506,"omg no way, im at disneyland today too and i think were in the same hotel, im literally looking at the bed frame, wall painting and lamps and its exactly yours lol. How you manage to film and upload a video while at disneyland is insane."
12507,brah! were you crying ...?
12508,Elon was awkward but it was endearing to see the imperfect side of him
12509,Problem #1 treating DOGE as if it’s a stock!
12510,"Dude, it was GAAAAAARBAGE. And all that hype verified by him with winks and checks and nods to give us THAT!?! Now I figured it would drop but still, damn"
12511,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. Bought at 0.30, sold at 0.72."
12512,This was no surprise :p
12513,Robinhood is a joke no average joe should use it
12514,So glad I sold at .64! You look great without a beard! 🙏
12515,I loved this chat
12516,When my orders take longer than 30 seconds I cancel and resend the order usually works
12517,Typing error... should have read have a nice day Elon.
12518,Bro I ordered to buy doge at 51 at 2pm ..... but they didn’t execute. Can we sue em?
12519,I think you are ruling out all of us who are holding long term and waiting to see if Doge can go up like BTC did over 5 years.  Nobody ever expected $55K per coin when it was $1K about 5 years ago.  Doge is a movement....
12520,Bring bearded Kevin back!
12521,Did you guys get vaccinated? So glad you finally got out!
12522,I'm in Florida too! I'll help you with your life insurance if you're in Washington state...
12523,"Exchanges are just begging to be more regulated. The SEC is already looking at them, and tonight didn't help their cause."
12524,I think BTC may break a new record if Doge goes down more.
12525,SNL just is boring.
12526,Have a great vacation!  Thanks for commenting on SNL!
12527,All crypto dropped I’m thinking it was a set up ?
12528,Kevin is a self made millionaire. Much respsect.
12529,"Hey, I  got in on doge @ .21 and out the day before snl the ship show.. Elon is definitely all for himself maybe some bi polar. Number one rule I have is any 1% er is not going to look out for me. They are all full of ship and want your money ALWAYS. 💰🤑 GO F@#$ YOURSELF ELON YOU DIDN'T GET MY MONEY"
12530,It was freaking terrible
12531,You were at Disneyland and I didn't meet you. Man wish I caught yah since I work there!
12532,I think you are basing your opinion on the exchange you are on... not the crypto..
12533,The world has lost its mind!!! Looking for SNL to increase a crypto 🤦🏻‍♂️
12534,"Sell sell sell
Buy the dip 
Then hold 
Hits $1 in 2 years ands sells"
12535,“To the mooooon” - Elon 🚀
12536,😭😭😭😭
12537,Also its better to trade cryptos on exchange like Coinbase or Binance instead of Robinhood etc... No delays
12538,"Kevin, look for acronyms in the SNL script. Particularly the ones involved with Elon. He even mentions he likes acronyms. You did a good job with Spotify so I trust you’ll find it! Good luck!"
12539,$SHIB INU $SHIBASWAP to the # MOON
12540,KEVIN GO TO SLEEP! 😂😂
12541,"GOOD BUY DIP AND HODL, MORE COINS!!"
12542,And Elon was just being honest about it because we all know that there's people that are new to stocks that might fuck up and invest everything or a amount they can't afford to lose so he was just giving advice I still think we are not sitting to bad right now
12543,"A textbook ""Buy the hype sell the news"". Sell while you still have a profit. If you really like DOGE, buy back at the dip, I think DOGE  probably gonna dip some more. Maybe is not over but be smart and take profits."
12544,"although I am not your fan as I am not any YouTuber fan, for sure you deserve much more subscribers than Chris and Larry which you have. why bc you explain the market for people who watch and talk about strategies. I will put some criticism on your videos later and want to see your fan reaction. are they open to opposite opinions or not. The experiment did not go well for those guys I mentioned bc when you have less knowledge you have more blind emotional extreme fans call you uncle or hero or whatever. To start feedback here, please be more mature in your videos and do not make crazy sounds. I understand that can be cool but not evrytime. Consider that lots of professionals listening to your lives in the background while they are at work. and I mean pros really pros in their jobs."
12545,SNL is an embarrassment to mainstream TV. Mainstream Tv is a joke in and off itself 🤣
12546,Kevin is the only person that works during vacation lol
12547,Why would people start selling.. makes no sense. Do these clowns want to make money. Push the price up buy the dips.
12548,Doge to the moon! 🐕🚀🌕
12549,That's why I don't use Robinhood anymore.  Moved to Pionex.
12550,Buy the rumor sell the news
12551,My man tried the entire cocktail menu at Oga’s Cantina
12552,Learn how blockchains work. Its transaction times are considerably slower than say visa. This event had to be massive for the system. Im hodling. This will pass. Too many players in the game for this to take crypto out.
12553,the next catalyst is amazon
12554,Just bought the dip!!! 20% off baby
12555,"Kevin, you promised not to make a video on the weekend and said to see you on Monday. Liar"
12556,People got spooked when the whale sell off. Elon did good i didn't really think he would. People need to quit being weenies and HODL
12557,"A huge whale dumped to sabotage, RH sabotaged transactions the entire show, that being said Elon did great I think"
12558,Not all true Kevin. I kept getting error when I tried to buy the dip
12559,So s&l still sucks hahaha
12560,Shiba coin
12561,Man binance is instant lol I wouldn't use robinhood if it takes 20mins... They're definitely using that time to their advantage and charging you more
12562,Don't care Hldn
12563,Disagree with you Kevin. The Doge Community held it’s own tonight as some of the whales dumped their coins. We prevailed and we are going to continue to grow. Tonight was huge for Doge. TO THE MOOOOOON!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
12564,Remember when Kevin said Coinbase was an insane deal at $400. It’s becoming insanely obvious that Kevin is a FOMO Master. Can’t take anything he says serious.
12565,this is the final full week of Taurus(the bull) I expect good things
12566,Elon said on the show tonight that doge is going to the moon.
12567,13.33 minutes of unnecessary babbling 👎
12568,Wrong.
12569,go vpn mode and just go in the market you dont hold them you don't own them always have your private keys
12570,"Never predict 

key word = anticipate."
12571,Elon was super clear he wants a $SHIBa Inu
12572,"Been in crypto since 2016 big boy. I ""FOMOed"" into doge today at .68.......and I'm ok with it. Like you said, diamond hands. I'm diamond until 2025. 
That my friend was a great fud video. You don't care about $1.33 lol you want to run for gov? Better start taking the mask off huh?"
12573,"People getting rekt on DOGE was fairly wildly predicted.  I only hope the degenerate gamblers don't run to the government asking, ""Why did you let this happen?""  Stiffling regulation to follow? :("
12574,"Kevin still don't understand ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". This was peak media and peak news. So people sell. The hype phase was the last weeks."
12575,SNL hasn’t been great in years.
12576,Snl said worst things about the dollar not being based on gold.  I don't understand whoever thinks this was bad
12577,you a bitch hater
12578,"DISNEYLAND!!!! 
Wooooo!!"
12579,Let’s go Shiba coin
12580,"We had a limit buy set a day ago at .50 for 10,000 Doge and it did not get executed on RH"
12581,It’s so obvious SNL host goes to the highest bidder.
12582,"The Boomer code word for NOT wanting you to get gains is that this has no FUNDAMENTALS...Warren Buffet says this same ol song and dance about BITCOIN! #HOLD #Hodl your #doge #dogecoin!!! Kevin was HATING when we were less than 10 cents! The whales want to push the poor out, hold #dogearmy!!!!!"
12583,Tis but a scratch
12584,Doge holders give no reason to why you should hold it or buy just 'get rich'. Hopefully the doge crash and burn will direct people to real world applications for cryptocurrency
12585,cel's should stay out of politics and s n l skits
12586,*in Kevin I trust*
12587,Damn.  An ad every minute
12588,So dogecoin is about to blow to 5$
12589,SNL has always been corny lame and tragic though....
12590,SNL sucked so bad it crashed doge
12591,"The acts were horrible. Elon literally called Doge a hustle, as in a scam. If you didn't get it, it's because the joke is you."
12592,"side note, not sure if it is you who manually puts ads for non subscription youtube or you tube puts the ads on your video. This was a great video            other than the 5 ads I had to watch elon musk really killed die hards tn in that skit imo"
12593,SHIBA LNU = DOGECOIN KILLER !
12594,I was expecting this to happen...also notice how before the dump BTC went up because the smart money migrated there before the dump.
12595,Mad respect for the grind on vids this late Kevin
12596,SEC needs to regulate cryptocurrency. It's too much pump and dump. Way too volatile and dangerous.
12597,"I don’t think it’s too bad dear. Buy during the slump, everything will even out...While I do agree it’s a bubble market, I don’t yet believe it’s reached its height...only time will tell, lol...💕💕💕💕, et that’s why am still rooting for etc. I think we will see a few more peaks..."
12598,"Doge helped other meme coins grow. Especially SHIB, I may be late but I'm happy for Doge"
12599,"I knew it was going to be a massive disappointment, so I brought more ethereum instead and boy... am I glad I did."
12600,Your diamond hands comments are so unethical. You've become another sales man.
12601,Kevin has no clue. Sold at 3 cents. And there are fundamentals. And upcoming BIG thing. But he just didn’t do good enough research. Even missed crypted Elon’s tweet. I understand: to much on his table with doing videos.
12602,To tha moooon
12603,bro go enjoy your damn time at Disneyland
12604,You just cant stay away!! 😆😆
12605,Elon Musk said a Dogecoin is just as real as a dollar. Perhaps he is hinting that 1 DOGE = $1. Price target $1?!
12606,"""Scripts were not that great""

THE TRUTH WAS TOLD..its a shitcoin"
12607,I'm missing the beard
12608,🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
12609,How many have you had sir?  Just two?
12610,One more thing alot roof the elites dont want you to buy cryptocurrency because they want you to put your hard earned money into stocks so they can get richer these companies got tax cuts but the worker didn't benefit from it they put it in there pockets that's why I love the fact Joe took them tax breaks back
12611,"From a crypto day trader: You couldn't be more wrong about your robinhood orders filling. Trade on a real exchange and watch the price action; a limit order is designed to fill at that exact price. If nobody is willing to sell it at that exact price, it will not get filled. If you NEED to get out, you must do a market order."
12612,Just use Binance US. Goes down far less often than Robin Hood.
12613,"Elon did a great job, the SNL writers suck.  The whole time, Ford was prostituting their brand."
12614,Here go come on push it buy the dip buy the dip
12615,I thought Elon was adorable and funny. Doge has hardly dropped...think you’re being a drama queen.
12616,cant wait for the next prothedoge interview
12617,"To be fair, I had difficulty buying more DOGE at the dip. Didn't look to sell any.
But yes, either way these platforms need to pull their act together."
12618,Use a crypto exchange. Problem solved.
12619,Bought more @ 49. I was thankful for the dip
12620,"Shiba Inu does not come when you call.   Shiba inu comes when Shiba Inu wants to. 


She wants to dig,   maybe next week she will want to play.   And as always,  Doge is for fun."
12621,"""It's a hustle""

12622,Yo dingbat. Chill the f out. It was good.
12623,"He Hating like a bitcoin Boomer! He looking like Munger and Warren Buffett, don't believe this flush faced fool! He would have sold at .04 cents if he bought at a penny and missed out on crazy gains! #doge #dogecoin #DogecoinToTheMoon #dogearmy #ElonMuskSNL #DogeCoinTo1Dollar"
12624,Good old robinhood/Hedgie pump and dump

12629,"<Bitçòìn price is prone to volatile swings, making it historically popular for traders to speculate on. According to bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other four months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2023. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to the end the bull run towards mid years. Investors and traders find it difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market, hodling is profitable but trading far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading cryt0 assets early enough, I didn't think it was possible enough to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Brian Nelson program for investors and newbabies who lacks understanding on how trading Bit¢ó!N works, to help them stack up more Bit¢ó!Ns, since late last year  till date I have made over 15btc from 2.6btc with Carl's help.

12631,"I'm looking at it though a different lens.
Elon just reached out to a whole new audience of people and introduced them to the beginnings of crypto currency. As for Doge I blame the dip on the whales and Robin hood for this dip. I'm personally all in and I'll go down with the ship if need be. If this is the people's coin , then we the people should decide if it stays or goes. Doge family stay strong. 💪"

It increased awareness, so it’s amazing for crypto overall. It really does not matter if you talk well or bad, people will research on their own and find the “doge millionaires” lol"
12641,I hate finance you tubers because they put lots of adda
12642,As it should be.... No reason Elon should be a face to doge or his words make it rise. I didn't know investing meant following gosip like Kardashians
12643,Kev you need to get into bonfire
12644,You in my city 🙌🏼
12645,Actually SNL was awesome! And that your buy/sell orders didn’t work quick is also ok: people want it for a long-term and don’t want speculants in doge

12647,Did you really not expect this dip? The comeback is gonna be better than the 4/20 “fiasco”
12648,"Did people really see the DogeCoin parts as a negative? I thought it was great, funny, and was used to jab at the current financial system. I expected our dip to fall as low as .30's but seeing how it is currently at 0.569. A funny after-party on Twitter is OKCoin poking jabs at Robinhood now having RH members message them to help them change over to OKCoin. lol"

12677,"Kevin, you are giving Robinhood way too much credit here. Buyers or not, their systems couldn’t handle the volume. Most could not buy or sell and orders were pending both ways. Many different errors were displayed. Market orders wouldn’t even go through. You couldn’t even cancel a pending order. Imagine a market selloff and you go to sell stocks in Robinhood. They will crash and you will lose most of your money. I would recommend everyone leaving Robinhood if you care about preserving your investment."

12691,"I said it before Robinhood is scam and Doge is just a meme coin. People who don't do their research will lose. Next you will see Cardano bring value not based on the price but based on giving opportunities to the deceloping world not something like Doge that's just counting on one person to pump the price. Cardano was nominated for the best blockchain and use case and Doge has more marketcap value than Cardano that isn't even comparable, it never made sense, while back I was hoping you would do an interview with Charles Hoskinson, that would have been among your best interviews ever."
12692,"If kevin was on a deserted island, he'd find a way to post a daily video."
12693,"Robinhood is a piece of shit platform for trading.  Buying issues, selling issues, would not feel comfortable investing tens of thousands with robinhood.  Good to see you are not advertising it anymore."
12694,SNL is stupid as shit just like doge...
12695,SNL is not that great anymore.I watched it and liked Elons parts.

12703,People really don’t understand doge it’s is a joke (meme) coin dose that mean it can’t have actual fundamentals no it definitely can but the how can you be mad about them making jokes about something that was literally was created as a joke and oh if you thought the skits was bad on SNL you obviously don’t watch SNL it’s not for everyone
12704,sold all my doge before snl and bought shiba inu
12705,Thanks for the update but family first!

12712,"Robinhood has trouble whenever there is extremely high volume.  I tried buying and couldn't.  This happened to Doge about three weeks ago and at least once with GME.

Have made more on other things than I would have made on it since, too lol"
12716,"Kevin.. am I the only one who heard Elon call Doge Coin a ""hustle""?? (Negative connotation) As if this this was all a game to him?? Or am I over thinking it because I just finished a doobie?? 😙💨💨💨💨😏"

12751,SNL is just propaganda at this point.
12752,Lol SNL was a sabotage to dogecoin too many haters on that show I'm surprised its last this long no one funny on there anyway. Dave Chappelle show will forever be funnier than SNL
12753,Why not start to use credible crypto exchanges? Where you can actually transfer your crypto into a cold storage wallet? Another affiliate marketing opportunity 😉
12754,SNL is socialist propoganda disguised as comedy. Always has been and always will be

miss it 
sincerely other man with cool beard"
12758,"people should have stopped using a centralized garbage platform like RH after the GME nonsense earlier this year. When will people learn.

12777,Elon did us dirty
12778,thumbnail is misleading. all i have to say
12779,It seems like SNL wanted Elon to look stupid.

12786,"Left with 8k profit. Fuck this. Elon didn't deliver. Hope it doesn't affect TSLA even though there is no actual correlation, but retail investor sentiment is not something to be played with."
12787,I thought it was great!!!!!!!!🤔🤔🤔 #doge #dogecoin #DogecoinToTheMoon #dogearmy #ElonMuskSNL #DogeCoinTo1Dollar
12788,So if Robinhood owns all of the Doge it trades on its platform (because they have all of the doge in their own exchange wallet and not individual wallets of their buyers) does that mean that trades that happen on the robinhood platform don't effect the market at all? Or does robinhood itself buy / trade from its own wallet for every transaction? 🤔 Or am I thinking about that all wrong?
12789,Anyone else notice doge gets dumped and ETH and Polygon start a bull run all after SNL
12790,ROBINHOOD IS THE BIGGEST SCAM! They knew & anticipated all this SMH
12791,You look 20 years younger without that beard 🧔.. 💕 .. just saying ..

12794,Yes however ... let me introduce you to shiba Inu coin.
12795,sell doge buy safemoon ladies
12796,I think everyone running up to Elon asking him to mention doge on SNL made him not want to mention doge.
12797,"You are new to crypto, this is not like stocks. There isn't MM's that have to provide liquidity to sellers. Example, on Trust Wallet in the U.S. it is nearly impossible to purchase BNB or Smart Chain because Simplex is the provider and there are not enough sellers to provide buyers with opportunity.  RH holds 28% of the Doge coins in their wallet to allow RH traders to play Doge. RH never gives ownership of Doge to RH traders. So RH needs enough buyers to be willing to pay the limit sell price.  RH will not fill an order on their dime and eat the loss when this crashes. If I put in a limit sell for say .50 and no kne is willing to pay that, it sits. RH is not going to buy and hold a losing asset just because I want to sell it, they will only sell if someone is will to pay my asking price, it is comparable to options. No one is forced to buy your option except upon in the money expirations. MM promise liquidity to keep the market moving, this scenario is like comparing apples to oranges. The good news is your coin won't be worthless,  but no one will buy it and you can't own it so you can't even use it to buy tickets at an A's game :("
12798,"we all saw that coming. in crypto, you buy the rumor and sell the news"
12799,"The show totally sucked... best part of the evening was the 2nd commercial in by LUCID that was intentionally placed there after Musk threw shade at Peter Rawlinson on Twitter this past week... and stating at the end of the advertisement that the Lucid Air will be the FIRST AND ONLY company to achieve over 500 mile battery range.  Amazing marketing by LUCID.  I respect Elon a lot but if anyone doesn’t think MAJOR competition is coming fast... they are sadly mistaken.

12831,We’re people actually expecting it to go up today? This happens every time...everyone should know by now to buy the rumor and sell the news. The same exact thing happened on “doge day” on April 20th. The only issue that I had with tonight wasn’t from snl. It was from Robinhood having issues with orders. That was something that shouldn’t still be happening.

12842,Doge has no team working on it I think it can’t handle all the traffic on the network that’s why it’s taking forever to exchange the tokens btc and eth sometimes take hours when it’s extremely busy
12843,Well he did say he wanted people to sell it to a penny....
12844,Glad Kevin saw the price difference between RobinHood & Webull. Thought I had a lag. 🤔🤔🤔
12845,Very interesting.  Hello from New Zealand. I love listening to your live closing market on my journey to work.
12846,Regardless we Now know Elon is a supporter . DOGE is #4 in crypto and that says enough. Doge doesn't Need Elon it is happening organically the entire community growing 😘 love ya but I feel you are not seeing the good out of this at All but you see the good when Tesla Tanks???

12861,Poop COIN!!!! People will lose their money betting on dogecoin
12862,oh Man...ipulation..
12863,"In short, sell your doge."
12864,"If people actually used real exchanges instead of these pseudo crypto exchanges it would be fine, download Kraken and learn how to use it."
12865,"If you “invest” in dogecoin you are a moron, it’s not a real currency, a completely idiotic “investment” (not an investment whatsoever because it’s not real and doesn’t exist)."
12866,Yeah I noticed the stop to sell off also.  On Webull on last Doge run it sold majority of Doge then I noticed I still have some left on my Webull. Maybe it was my error. I don't know.
12867,Look out for the next catalyst
12868,Manipulation
12869,"dogecoin was always a joke coin it has an unlimited cap  and adds 10,000 new dogecoin every block reward the price will continue to dilute as the buying slows. Invest with caution."
12870,"Yes, making a video during a vacation....classic Kevin"
12871,Is Robinhood Robbin the hood again??
12872,#Dooooge! 😭
12873,"That thumbnail doe 😂😂😂
I was like ""how tf did he grow his beard that quickly?!?"""
12874,Safemoon is pumping
12875,"That's because you don't own your crypto on RobinHood. They just give you a contract for difference and they pay you the difference. When doge moons, they are on the line for millions that they don't want to pay. So  they cut off selling until the price comes back down."
12876,Snl hasn’t been good since 97
12877,H O D L
12878,Wheres your beard kevin?
12879,"Have y'all not realized that when everyone thinks something is going to happen, it doesn't happen? haha. This is almost always the case, especially when it comes to markets. The very act of a majority of people thinking something will happen will cause it to not happen"
12880,Scripts definitely a flop...still HODL....
12881,Should have bought the rumor & sold the news
12882,"Personally, I think Elon did a good job mentioning about DOGE, people taking profits, but it will be up up and away in the future as long as Elon keeps mentioning about DOGE. Hail to the DOGE father!"
12883,It was horrible
12884,Adreeded lest Sued robinhood .
12885,🔥ETC = $1k in 2021🚀🌕
12886,It was not bad lol. It will go back up. Time to re-load.
12887,I had no issue buying and selling doge as a test when everybody said their orders wouldn’t go through on webull. I lost 16 cents lol
12888,people still keep using Robinpop 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
12889,Elon Musk himself shorted dogecoin eairlyer today.
12890,Glad to see you on vacation dude.
12891,Hold or sell doge?
12892,💎✋
12893,"Yea, you guys hating on this whole Snl appearance are mad whack, This is good news all around, you guys are just flipping it wrong"
12894,Kevin grow the beard back. You look weird as hell without it
12895,I feel like you're a lil salty Kevin
12896,ohk that's it....i am fking leaving
12897,"news got sold. but, it holding in its 50s, so its not too bad"
12898,Crypto trading can be done 24/7. I am not all that concerned with the going price. I pull out most of it when I sleep. It spikes wildly sometimes up sometimes down. It's like playing a slot machine. You have to watch it like a hawk.
12899,The show was soo cringe. I am very disappointed.
12900,"Watch now until Monday , its going up,  He did a good job explaining Dogecoin"
12901,SNL hasn't been funny in 15 years
12902,NEVER WATCHING SNL AGAIN
12903,Too the moon! 🌘
12904,oh come on like you didnt know and werent continually shilling it for weeks. get real
12905,I'm glad I have Ethereum...
12906,I thought Elon was super funny...and stoked doge is falling. Crypto down then stocks go up....happy days   doge apocalypse good!!!!
12907,=......((
12908,"I think the opposite is going on, a Huge whale sold and their entire order filled so after that no one could buy, Robinhood started restricting
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a huge pump tomorrow"
12909,Show was dope Elon did great #HaterAgent #DOGE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙 🖕🏾Millennial money🖕🏾
12910,I loved you as batman Mr Affleck! Huge fan. Lol
12911,I agree with the thesis that there is merely a lack of buyers over the course of the night. That’s why people cannot sell and get trapped! Predictable outcome on hope again
12912,Mama musk... why?! All doge army is feeling like Pete over at mars.
12913,Kevi how much did you have to drink at California Adventure?🤣
12914,5 people in my family could not buy on Robinhood during SNL
12915,Grant Cardone!!!
12916,"Now it is hard to tell now today, tomorrow will determine the doge"
12917,I have the same experience. I tried to sell in Robinhood but it went through approximately 20-30 minutes. I also tried to buy in Gemini but it took long time to go through. It’s horrible!
12918,I’ve hated SNL for years now
12919,Stay healthy Kevin we need you for longest time - thanks for this video we all needed this
12920,"BUY HOGE!!!!!!!!!! DOGE IS OLD NEWS Literally made 30% gains in a day with only 54,000 traders this thing is just beginning mark my words !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
12921,"Fundamental, momentum, squeeze... IPOE please."
12922,Elon: _”Ha ha ha.’’_
12923,SNL isn't ever that great. Talk about Robinhood shutting down during the broadcast.
12924,This is the last time Doge will ever see .50 cent. It will be going up
12925,Warren redlich disagrees 🤣🤣
12926,Your voice sounds so weird. 😃😃😃
12927,Stocks going to boom on Monday
12928,SNL has been unwatchable for so long now..tonight was no exception..🙄
12929,"You look sweaty. You look nervous, you weird, unqualified, degree lacking, education missing (not entirely sure you graduated high school based on your story). Dude, you don't know real estate, let alone running a state. You couldn't be mayor of a zipcode. You won't see this. But you're still a moron regardless"
12930,I’m cheering from the sidelines!
12931,I bought doge on Webull. Was able to sell immediately
12932,We was looking for you threw all of this 💯
12933,I thought it was good!
12934,SNL hasn’t had a good script in well over 10 years !!! Elon did pretty good to me .
12935,Thank u for this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
12936,What's the real tragedy was how RH (once again) f'ks over all of their clients. No one was able to salvage their account as it tumbled.
12937,That pump didn't work
12938,Elon musk on SnL was not to pump doge to a dollar. also the fact that Elon moms mentioned Dogecoin to him shows the meme that it is
12939,Anything to this bitpay to Amazon possibly taking doge?
12940,"The hustle never stops, mad respect! Now go have some fun"
12941,"He said, DOGE to the moon!!!"
12942,"SNL is a piece of garbage show constantly spewing the same liberal only propaganda in the form of attempted jokes. All those that bought doge on hopes that a stupid show would pump it deserve to lose money.  Invest, don’t gamble on liberal bs"
12943,"Elon and his mom looked so awkward. Man, it's torturing."
12944,Dude it’s a pump and dump . Elon snl was the date line
12945,Did Elon say before he was going to peg Dodge with dollar?
12946,Kevin got a little bombed at the Disney.  BTW if at California Adventure the swings are the best ride of all of Disney.
12947,I was hoping to see the beard :(
12948,It was horrible
12949,Still holding!!
12950,"Oh poor Kevin, loosing his beard makes him look doge whiny baby."
12951,"Namaste 🙏🏾 🧘🏾‍♂️.  

After losing my job in the pandemic😷.    

I created my channel believing for MYSELF, YOU and the rest of the WORLD 🌍🔥."
12952,"Use KuCoin to trade Doge, not RH or WB."
12953,Stop it man.  My order went through fine. On Robinhood.
12954,"Doge is speculative at best, it's not an investment. If the price hinges on a SNL episode then it's probably not something to focus on too much."
12955,Disneyland. Pump that stock Kevin 2.0
12956,"The writing on the show has SUCKED for YEARS! Elon isn't an actor but I think he did great considering. Sadly people will actually think that he called it a ""hustle"" tho. Don't think any of this had to do with the dump .. whales were planning to dump before the show even started imo. If you told me a week ago it'd be over $0.50 today I'd be happy AF! It's a meme coin and not close to my biggest position in crypto, but it's still fun. It will still get to $1, just longer than expected (or in a normal time lol)."
12957,Thanks bro
12958,Who bought the dip? 👐 👐
12959,You can try sell your doge but if there are no buyers LMAO
12960,"I’d heard it was the opposite, I heard you weren’t able to buy for a certain time but you were able to sell"
12961,"some of the actors didn't want to work with Elon.
I haven't watched the show in years. no wonder I haven't seen it in so long.
DOGE/Elon kept SNL alive. lol"
12962,"Yeah, my Robinhood stopped working for a brief time too."
12963,"At 12:41 central time, Robin and webull are the same price for Doge but I noticed the same. Also the server problems with Robin and really slow price during SNL on Webull."
12964,I got out this morning at .65 cents.  Hahaha. I knew SNL would blow it.
12965,See you tomorrow at Disneyland Kevin ?!?! Hyped
12966,SNL is garbage and I've been waiting to see this sell-off tonight...I love Elon but this was not a great idea. SNL is for like 17 year olds now and it's just cringe. That whole episode was cringe...
12967,"EL MERCADO ES UNA MAMADA, PERO MIENTRAS NOS HAGA GANAR DINERO, ES SUFICIENTE 🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽 SAYING HI FROM MÉXICO, YOUR INFO IS SO USEFUL FOR TRADING, THANKS"
12968,HE CALLED IT A HUSTLE....LOLOLOL
12969,They prevent people from selling. It's almost as if they have a majority share and their incentivised to put in the buy orders over selling them off
12970,Kev buzzin 🍻 $10 beers at Disney 🤑
12971,loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
12972,The wave is coming bro
12973,Doge 😩🤬
12974,Doge is garbage. Period. Garbage. It serves anybody who bought it right for being stupid
12975,"Try AnchorUSD. They have no issues. Also, try Voyager."
12976,"I was so pissed at his mom for that first ""joke""."
12977,HOW ABOUT I VOTE YOU TO THE GOVERNOR OF MY TOILET? It fits you!
12978,Hope you had fun with the family and the Stefamily today! See you on Monday! Happy mother's day to your wife!
12979,Your in the Happiest place on earth and his still worries about asset currency.
12980,"I thought Elon did good
We all knew it would drop"
12981,Wow so jealous Disney!! Have fun with the family.Boys must be having a blast.
12982,"Hey Kevin, thanks for taking time from your family vacation for a quick update.. have a great sunday!"
12983,RHE 🚀
12984,"LOL....he tried so hard to pump it...his performance as an actor..shouldn't effect an financial tool...

HUSTLE COIN"
12985,"""the acts just were not that great""

Are you new to SNL by any chance? 😂"
12986,...will this be the end of Chad?
12987,Hahahaha Crash Dogecoin
12988,Tooo Thhhheee Mooooonnnnnnn 💪
12989,Safemoon!!! 🚀🚀🚀
12990,I keep hearing and being told that it’s the Robinhood wallet that holds the most doge supply? Is that wallet address truly RH can you please shed light on this . Is it a whale or Robinhood wallet for its customers that’s the “whale”???
12991,It was bad dude 😂
12992,"Why does his appearance matter jesus...
And yet doesn't it lol. Even I'm watching tooth and nail. Thank god I got in at 0.22"
12993,"Enjoy Disney, Meet Kevin"
12994,"People should stop buying crypto on ""stock"" exchanges and take the time to learn how to get crypto on ""crypto"" exchanges."
12995,Buy the rumor sell the news :)
12996,Thanks have a good vacation
12997,Hey Kevin not in the studio 😁💯😁💯
12998,"Doge and crypto act as a contract for difference or CFD for short, so the orders on Robinhood don't affect the volume on other exchanges."
12999,Missed you all day today nothing good to listen to! Get back in the office hahaha
13000,This is only the beginning.
13001,Kevin is faded
13002,"HAHAHAHAHAH!!!! XRP,VET real world solutions quit following mainstream anything the rich dont want you in on the real currencies..."
13003,Plot Twist: Elon buys his Mom a crap ton of Doge for Mothers day and gives us all a stimmy
13004,Anyone here that thinks it's over for doge is clearly new to doge we have been here before you will sell your coins thinking you're saving them and then cry at the next milestone in a few weeks.
13005,I’m holding until they find something better than crypto
13006,I fell asleep and missed buying it before it fell. 😴😴😴
13007,"I bought it today at 49 cent for $10,000"
13008,Generation X hospital was hilarous...and the meth/maga joke was epic
13009,Does the legend reply?
13010,Hahaha this is funny
13011,"There was a planned XRP pump earlier this year and it was the same thing. The smart thing is to by way early and sell before everyone else does. So Doge dumping tonight was completely expected. It started before the show, and got worse before Doge was mentioned the first time."
13012,"Well, SNL has sucked for the last 25 years."
13013,STOP THE BS KEVIN!
13014,Gotta love that vintage bed frame background lol.. looks like my grandmas room 🤣
13015,The stock market in China is about to crash watch your coins in the end nobody invested will have nothing
13016,Kevin you made me feel better about Doge lol thank you.
13017,When Elon's mom made the doge joke in the opening...... doge started to tank right then...
13018,Bonfire & GMR finance tokens Rocketing today
13019,"doge is and always was a pump&dump coin, kevin.."
13020,Buy the DIP
13021,Nothing burger :)
13022,enjoy the vacation Kevin you and your family deserve it
13023,"Hey Kevin now I’m really disappointed by you. Are you serious? The amount of mentioning Doge was more than ever expected. Did you seriously expect that show to be solely a Doge pump? Did you not understand the joke that Doge can’t easily be explained to regular people? 

 Not sharing your evaluation of the show at all. It’s ridiculous to bash the show for not pumping Doge to 1$."
13024,"Ill never understand why is the mainstream so obsessed with shitcoins? Stop buying pump and dumps and hold quality crypto projects, holy hell."
13025,I wanted to get in on the free Doge trade but they required yh ou to have atleast 10k to trade and I'm short so I couldnt do it. Kinda broke my little heart lol
13026,Sold my dogecoin
13027,Dogecoin 🚀🚀🚀
13028,"But doge is a joke, right?
Seems like a repeat of 4/20 but less so. We'll see!"
13029,I couldn’t sell Doge either on Robinhood!!! WTF!!
13030,Did the same on 420. The paper hands can keep selling. Us Dimond hands will profit.
13031,"Buy the rumor, sell the news, as always 😁"
13032,It’s crazy how fictional TV actually effects the way people view reality.
13033,Elon has terrible humor.
13034,thanks for the update governor.
13035,oh my god wut's happening. I am here with. buy the dip !!!
13036,Come on KEVIN he did say that it’s the future currency.🤔
13037,doge is a joke... it has no value....everyone who knows anything about crypto networks knows that.... its gonna end ugly eventually.  If you're in doge you're gambling not investing.
13038,Welcome to OC
13039,"No Kevin, this is simply ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"". Also, why are you trading crypto on Robinhood 🤦🏻‍♂️"
13040,Those assholes are probably bought by the wealthy wallets to crash Dogecoin because it definitely threatens all the other crypto and the dollar itself.
13041,7 DAYS AGO IT WAS 38 CENTS LOL UP %50 THIS WEEK. SELL THE DOGEARMY YOUR COIN THANNKS.
13042,"It wasn’t just doge that they ridiculed, but elon also.....aaaand Kevin is drunk 😂"
13043,The SNL scripts were lame.
13044,"Have none of you kids ever heard ""sell the news""? LMAO..smh"
13045,"Kevin, you’re a brilliant man, I love your content and valuable information. 

I’m just going to say this, it’s best not to over analyze this. 

It is just meant to be an opportunity for him to connect with his more human nature side and have the ability to interact with people on a large scale for the sake of easy going and down to earth fun.

It wasn’t intended for him to give an authentic analysis of any crypto or alt-coin. 

It was just to poke some fun brother, much love and respect ✊"
13046,Just sell
13047,Still holding. Buy the dip. Diamond hands
13048,You knew it was going to dump during the show.
13049,Dogcoin to the moon.
13050,I bailed out of doge at. 72 glad I did.
13051,Cant sell so that the FED (whales) can dump on the little guys.
13052,"Elon said literally,  TO THE MOON!🚀🚀🚀"
13053,Actually I thought SNL was great but of course I haven’t watched that show in YEARS!  I had some good laughs 😂.  All I heard was Elon talk about crypto and mention BTC and ETH first then of course doge.  I’m a BTC and ETH investor.  I Think tonight was good PR for crypto in general and BTC and ETH.  Cheers!
13054,"Idk mayne but a lot of people had the same mentality about doge tonight, but the hype sell the news. I was expecting a bigger dip, to see doge recover the way it is rn is surprising tbh. I’m glad it’s doing this. Idk mayne I’m not agreeing with u on that specific topic"
13055,you better believe I bought that dip
13056,omg drunk meat
13057,It's going up man
13058,"Mother’s Day joke to make it drop, news skit to make it rise! Coincidence?"
13059,Or cancel my limit order I bought at 9am too 35 mins. And just to cancel a sell order. Ugh.
13060,O come on come push it! Buy the dip. Buy the dip! Oooo my god whats happening. 💯🦍🕺🐕🚀🚀🚀
13061,Is Disneyland reopened in Anaheim?
13062,"This was speculated and it dipped...all good. Robinhood and Coinbase crashed. It will continue up again. Hodl the line. Regardless of #Elon, crypto will continue!"
13063,The scripts were awful... also didn't help RH kept crashing.
13064,I know I was so disappointed
13065,"The Scripts were bad, but guys you have to know that Show TV Business is always Rushed to do a Episode. It was a Rush!!!"
13066,Was pretty clear imo that Doge will fall in the long run or at least for now...
13067,Doge has gone from .003 to .70 in less than 6 months 😂 I made more money just holding 300 bucks at .004 to .60 than I did with most of my stocks lol. People getting in now are way late and just chasing and FOMOing in
13068,I thought it was great episode! The only thing was Robin Hood breaking down
13069,That’s why you don’t buy crypto on a centralized exchange.
13070,"But...
But Elon Musk was supposed to be the chosen one!"
13071,HAHAHAHAHAHA I think it was actually great!!!!! If the hype of an investment comes down to comedy show comment and crash a coin by 20-40% then you're really taking massive gambling bet with your money! Which is FINE if you're ok with all the risk you took. [Risk management 101]
13072,How is this SNLs fault????
13073,The dip was a blessing I used it to pump another 20k in
13074,I hope your time off is going well. I loved SNL was great.  I still loved it and had fun swing trading it . Loved it.  Had a bunch of fun.  It was a Doge roast
13075,DOGE🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
13076,Did he glue a beard on!?🤣🤣🤣🤣
13077,"Please guys get real crypto projects! ETH, SOL, LINK, EGLD, VET, MATIC these can change people’s lives. 14,400,000 new DOGE are created every day. That’s 10,000 new coins per minute! Guys please move on. DOGE is not the answer. We can do this together without the nonsense meme coins."
13078,Lol it was something else. Scripts could've been better but I'm a simple man... Dogecoin will stay stagnant for now.
13079,bought the dip at 0.49 not upset at this moment ✌️keep holding
13080,Knew it.  Ethereum to the MOOOOONNNN
13081,"I expected a bunch of people to sell anyway. Bought the dip, now I’m in a better position. This is not over!"
13082,Robinhood and webull going offline through the whole thing didn’t help...
13083,Buy that shiba baby
13084,All they did was shook off all the coal hands. All that's left is 💎 🧤
13085,SNL needed the Hype...
13086,I am skeptical of doge. BTC and ETH is great. I don't own any doge.
13087,Much wow
13088,"Damn, Kevin! Your work ethic, productivity, and efficiency is unreal. You’re at Disneyland and you still deliver. Like how. Just wow!"
13089,I will keep doge just to keep the pump up. For the love of meme.
13090,"Woooooo, bag holders! Let’s go"
13091,It took me so long to sell
13092,"Great on point info and I agree with your assessment 100 percent 
."
13093,SNL isn’t funny and Elon isn’t funny. A lot of clowns got Rekt. Whales sold at 11:35pm EST. right when the show started.
13094,Yay on focus on your wife and family today
13095,"Hey, Doge is holding pretty well. It wasn't a good night; neither was it a bad one."
13096,Kevin why did his mother say that
13097,Why are you guys still using Robinhood??????? That's a better question.
13098,First
13099,dip for everybody else to get it!💪🏻🚀🚀🚀
13100,"Kevin, it was awesome meeting you at Disneyland today!"
13101,SNL has always been trash. buy SingularityNet AGI who’s integrating their ai into Cardano art contracts with their partnership.
13102,Doge is really a big joke
13103,I don’t get why people expected DOGE to be the main show? Just cuz ? I wouldn’t have found that funny or entertaining as an SNL episode
13104,Sold all of mine at .65
13105,Just enjoy the vacation man. its okay to take a day off when at Disney land haha.
13106,You are breaking up badly
13107,"$SHIB stole $DOGE's puppy chow....
Get SHIBA inu instead, it actually has an ecosystem, limited supply and under a penny"
13108,I pulled out and took profit and when it goes back to a a good buy in ill go back in
13109,Robinhood crashed. #HODL
13110,🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
13111,BTT🚀
13112,We up 1000% on the month tho
13113,Kevin is a multi millionaire but I've never been jealous of him until he said he was at Disneyland.
13114,Check doge she’s coming back
13115,Wasn’t very funny.
13116,Saw you guys today. My wife was telling me to say hi but I didn’t wanna bug ya
13117,You couldn’t stay away.... haha
13118,Tanked
13119,Got nothing to do with the show it was buy the rumor and sell the news!
13120,Pumpers creating a lot of bagholders in doge that are going to lose big when reality sets in.
13121,Doge at 56 cents currently...
13122,Really? I thought the skits were great! I don’t think if they were funnier it would of made a difference. I do agree the Mother’s Day joke didn’t help but the news skit was great and went way further than I thought! And it’s climbing again!
13123,Kevin you’re an idiot lmao
13124,#SafeMoon #SafeMoonArmy
13125,Nothing like Mad Tv and In Living Color
13126,Youre the man Kevin! You’ve helped me with my own financial litteracy so much. You rock! Love from canada
13127,I hope crypto crashes soon so everyone comes back to stocks.
13128,SNL hasn’t been funny in at least 15 years.
13129,This was fantastic.
13130,“Mare of Easttown” parody was the best!
13131,Planned. Big dogs owned most of it. Sell off and crash it
13132,It was really bad
13133,Doge got beat F in the chat
13134,Safemoon to the moon 🚀
13135,Only a little dip😂
13136,Just watch it when everybody else are sleeping
13137,Im hodling
13138,"Hi Kevin, though you were on holidays? 😉"
13139,U look Different now
13140,He does not rest
13141,Snl has been bombing for years time to pull the plug 🔌
13142,Bro you drunk Lmaoooo
13143,WE KNEW THAT WAS COMING….. the only ppl who got wrecked were rookie investors thinking doge could hit a dollar

13286,"X'R'P saw buying at $1.31 and while this did push it up the charts, buyers were unable to topple $1.75 resistance. This led to some bearish pressure and while the 20-SMA and 50-SMA offered some support, there was a chance of a further breakdown. Awesome Oscillator noted the said bearish pressure and a move below the half-line could indeed lead to an unfavorable outcome. Tradlng volumes across exchanges showed muted activity and a pr!ce hike was off the table at least over the coming sessions. Instead, focus would be on different support lines. A southbound move from $1.53 support would see X'R'P head towards another defensive line at $1.45. Another strong region of support resided at $1.31 and around the 200-SMA. OBV has been on a steady uptrend since late April and buying pressure would likely counter any move below the long-term moving average. I have used  services from many s!gnal providers, but Bryant Miller stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favor. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on tradlng but with the assistance of Bryant it was easier to understand. Bryant is an expert trader and finance journalist and you can find his free courses on tradlng on google which comes in handy as an !nvestor and he can be reached on gmαil bryantmillertrade@gmailcom and *𝕿ℯℓℯ𝕘𝕣𝓪ℳ☞ @bryantmillertrade for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns."

13312,"The fact is, BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me,i started with 1.5 BTC and i've accumulated over 7.5 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Harvey Archer.

According to bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year.I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all this changed when I encountered Elliot Wainman., although I have been into numerous services but Elliot Wainman stands out with experienced expertise in the field.

Doge started dropping on Saturday. 
The big whales got richer, and the late-comers bought doge at a much higher price.

13544,O stfu who cares
13545,"Dogecoin 
-transfers faster worldwide than fiat currency and at a lower transaction rate. (Extremely high assurance)
-strong community (low assurance)
-Elon musk **claims** he’ll pay out any of the whales that want to sell (not much assurance but maybe)

I don’t think it’s ridiculous for DOGE to exceed the difference of the transfer time and fee (could easily see it at $2-$5 if mass adoption happens), I think it could achieve that strong support if DOGE website offers IOS wallets, that are capable of mining using their phone/iPad gpu, and can seamlessly convert through Apple Pay transactions."

13589,"Btc is backed up by its use of darknet markets. Since feds are catching up on the btc technology and know how to trace the coins, large tumbler services that made it able to obscure the flow of btc got shut down for money laundering, almost all darknetmarkets have switched to monero. The only crypto I would invest in that I would consider safe is the one ppl buy heroin meth etc with all the other coins are Ponzi schemes. If btc does well the Ponzi altcoins do well, but there's nothing behind it, the only thing that's driving prices up is more money being invested. I went into Shiba coin and almost 5x it, burned my fingers and pulled out( I could've almost 10x but I was sleeping..) next  krypto that get hype like that I won't be that greedy anymore and sell early"
13590,"Elon musk wanted to say this is people’s currency, but people thinks and acts like this is Elon’s coin.
I think people have to give value to dogecoin not Elon Musk. Even if the price was on $1 or even more, it would’ve crash even bigger because it’s value built on Elon’s popularity not the actual coin. However Now if the price of the dogecoin goes up to $1 or $10, it won’t be because of Elon and it won’t crash.
I think Elon Musk did what he had to do on his end."

13602,"Dogecoin is the penny stock of crypto currency. It’s a shot term gamble and is vulnerable to manipulation due to its high ownership concentration in small number of accounts. Bitcoin has been doing great but, IMHO, 100% of its growth is due to speculative trading. Of course, this has been true since its inception and people have made $millions. 

ETH is the least speculative big name cryptocurrency. It’s use in smart contracts gives it a practical purpose and it seems likely to gain traction as people find new and creative ways to leverage the Etherium ecosystem. 

Having said this, most of ETH’s value (at the moment) is based on pure speculation, so there is very little correlation right now between its use/utility and its price.

It’s fun playing around with cryptocurrency but low cost commodities like silver, copper, etc. are much better choices for shielding your money from the monster levels of inflation that are almost certainly in our near future. Downside is that there is no realistic chance of exponential growth in their respective spot prices."
13603,bonfireeeeee !!!!!!!!!! 2x in 48 hours!
13604,It's retarded to buy BTC at this moment. It showed how weak it was to crash. It's overpriced. It's alt coin season. XRP is gonna explode after it beats the case. CAD already rising like hell along with ETH. It's not Bitcoin season by any fucking means.
13605,People are still going to try push dodgecoin to a 1 dollar. The whole goal was just to get a dollar and that never happened.

13611,"Elon owns btc , that s why he wants you to buy btc"
13612,"Why did Dogecoin tank after Elon Musk SNL comment about Dogecoin?
Because he was misunderstood!
He commented that Dogecoin was a ""Hustle"". Many were confused about his comment and took it the wrong way.
Here's my analysis.
Hustle Definition:
THE WRONG DEFINITION:
INFORMAL•NORTH AMERICAN
a fraud or swindle.
where it was obvious that he meant,
THE CORRECT DEFINITION:
busy movement and activity.
""Dogecoin hustles its way Moon bound""
Hasn't the dogecoin been seriously been busy with activity?
With the same breath Elon Must also said, ""Dogecoin is the cryptocurrency that will take over the world"" and ""to the moon"""
13613,Dodge coin 6 dollars on 2022 we all gonna see it $$$$$$$$$$$
13614,I lost 28 usdt doge coin 😓
13615,"Elon was like, ""Nobody is making money today"". Which pretty much makes him an asshole. :)"
13616,*WAIT!  A HUSTLE IS SLANG FOR A WAY TO MAKE MONEY.*  MICHAEL CHE IS FROM NYC.  When someone asks you what your hustle is they are asking you what your job or way to make money is.  That's why Elon said it's a way to make money and Che said oh it's a hustle.  Then Elon said confirmed.  People unfamiliar with the slang think they called it a scam when they were saying the exact opposite!

That's why this bubble is so unstable because everyone is trying to get rich and no bubble in history has ever accomplished that and made everyone involved rich. Put your money in actual good investments and stop gambling. What do you think happens at a dollar? A shiba inu will come down from the clouds and rain money down? No! Massive selling will happen! YOU WILL BE LEFT BAG HOLDING! The more it's being talked about the LESS buyers are out there!"

Who would believe Eurutheam was 66 cents 5 years ago.....Dogecoin is the 4 the biggest market cap in all Crypto currencies..Dogecoin isnt going anywhere soon and today wasnt rocket science for a sell off come on..The next leg up will be with stronger hands no doubt...Put in money you dont need and see where it is in 4 years....better than lotto..Perfect day for day trading skills is the way I look at this or great few days to top up.....Dogecoin is coming for number one spot fullstop."

13751,Your thumbnail selfie makes me feel sick
13752,"Wild theory here...

I think it’s possible the hedgies may be behind this, relating to GME and AMC. 

Seems possible Elon sold out for whatever reason; he helped pump Doge coin and then helped dump.  Incentive could be to finally get HFs to back off Tesla, as well as protect other investments he may have that could crash i the event of a squeeze (HF need to massively sell other longs to cover meme shorts)

If this is the case, would be very sweet indeed for HF’s- robbing retail to cover short call on other meme stocks. 

A lot of money could have been made going long over the past few months and then shorting last night, considering the massive whales described on this video it is very possible. 

Anyway, clearly speculation here, but if GME and AMC squeeze this week, I think it’s a good shout. 

Keep an eye on legacy next week."
13753,"How delusional people are...Lol. Elon said Doge is a hustle,on live tv.."

13760,Now time for VET!!🚀🚀👍🔥🤑
13761,"Doge coin is literally nothing... that was the whole joke “What is Doge Coin??” because it really has no value other then it being a meme. I definitely don’t believe in it in the long term and there’s definitely better way to invest like in XLM which is about the same price anyways. Like Elon said though, it’s just a hustles. People can make some good money on it, but the majority of us will not."

13846,You told everyone to buy and load up.  You pumped it up.   What exactly as predicted r u  talking about.
13847,Why are you doge fans listening to a guy who just got in crypto and doesn't have much clue about the industry. All of you are purely into doge for speculation and gains and not for the value proposition and technology. We're talking real money being invested in a joke crypto with no utility and no development and massive inflation. Be careful everyone.

13855,bonfire good project with a lot of new hodlers and making gains. think it will follow a price increase like doge and safemoon.
13856,"Safemoon is the real future, if ykyk."

13872,I have sell my dogecoin  & lost around 2500rs🥲 i am a student & every  time i have bad luck
13873,Sir what is your timeframe ( months/yrs) for Doge to reach $30 - $ 50
13874,Ohh Johny sins😜
13875,You are clearly just a YouTube guy who knows not much about crypto .Bye .Unsubscribing .
13876,"Guys, checkout the pump & volume of new (24hrs) coin. SHIBAPUP.

Good channel, bro"
13877,People hype it up before the event and it skyrockets then they tank it the day of the event then buy it back.
13878,"There was only 2 likely scenarios. The less likely scenario: it would hold at it's new high and consolidate for a while, or the more likely scenario: come back down to it's average. I called what would likely play out over a week ago. Dogecoin would get to about $0.67 to $0.76, ($0.85 at the most) and then likely come back down to $0.50 to $0.60 and consolidate therefor a while. I encourage everyone to zoom the graph out to see the bigger picture. You are not going to see anything looking at the daily graph. On a year timescale, you will see after Dogecoin got above $0.05, it met a resistance point at $0.10. It consolidated between $0.05 and $0.08 that lasted about 2 months, that is likely to repeat itself now before it breaks $1.00. It likely won't break and average over $1 until mid August to early September. So there is no reason to panic and sell, in fact, Dogecoin is still above it's average now, even after the crash. Dogecoin should only be around $0.49 right now as of writing this. $0.0125 * ((85% + (-45%) + 128%) / 3) * 128.95 = $0.49001

Remember, you haven't truly lost until you sell under your purchase price.."

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Prof Thompson program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.Thompson can be reached

14072,"Bitcoin isn't volatile.... the dollar is. 1 BTC is still worth 1 BTC
since its inception. Can we say that about the dollar? $1 from 1913 to
2020 is worth ~$20 according to an inflation calculator. So, which one
is really volatile? People need to stop looking at the price through
the lens of the dollar. Everyone sees the dollar value of Bitcoin but
don't realize that it's the dollar that is weak against BTC....that's
why there are huge price swings. People also don't realize that every
time they sell or buy crypto, they are expanding the current monetary
money supply. If you know how the current monetary system works, that
last statement will make perfect sense. If not, it will go over
heads.I take the risk of lower prices on the short term for granted,
knowing that the prices will be much higher on the long term. I am not
taking the risk of not having invested what I could (because I was
waiting for lower prices) and than not take full advantage of the bull
run.There is a significant difference between stocks which can be
based on professional advice held and currencies (cryptocurrency), and
this is because most of them are hypes and highly speculative. I have
made over $80,000 in the last two months day trading my BTC which I am
sure would be a fantasy if I where hodling. I trade with a platform
that is highly skilled in the cryptocurrency business, I was
introduced by Mr Eric bishop, I am aiming for higher highs. If you
have any inquiries, you can reach him on Gmail(eric.bishop100@gmailcom) I am spreading this for those who
are unable to turn in consitent profit in the crypto market



I started investing in Cryptocurrency fairly recently. Coming from a
non-technical background, understanding blockchain and crypto currency
is a little tricky. So to understand it better I invested USD 1000 and
started to pay attention to everything related to Cryptocurrency. i
made 2 BTC real quick in 2018, later lost 1BTC early 2019, i was still
trying hard to understand the market but everything was new to me
again (nightmare). I began to read several blog post and following
YouTube video tutorials to understand how I can make profit but the
more I try, the more I loose more of my Bitcoin. So not until I found
a beginners trading post talking about a strategy on how to trade and
make profit and I contacted the person in charge, Mr bishop he
explained to me the different ways to make profit in this bearish
market. I decided to give it a try and I invested 2 BTC of my coin,
and it quickly rose to 8 BTC towards the end of December 2019,and I
was convinced it is the best way to make a good profit from Bitcoin.
If you're still confused about the steps to take this year I urge you
to contact Eric.bishop100@gmail.comfor all
your cryptocurrency questions, strategy and beginners coaching.?





My best guess is that money pours into crypto during the first 2
quarters of the year as people get their tax returns and invest in
projects they like. During this time I expect a significantly rising
overall ""market cap"". I think it will cool off some during the summer
and pick back up around the holidays as families and friends get
together and reflect on 2020. During this time I believe we'll see
periods with bitcoin gaining faster than alts, followed by times where
alts are more profitable. The smart, stress free investor is hedged
into several crypto projects as opposed to ""all in"" on one or
frequently switching back and forth between alts and bitcoin. The
market will likely remain volatile but I believe with QUALITY cryptos,
highs will be higher and lows will be higher.Those with patience
who've only invested money they can afford to lose will likely
outperform most ""traders"". I think changing tax laws in first world
countries will further embolden the HOLD mindset, as (in the US) there
is a huge benefit to investors holding assets over a year, much higher
taxes for assets held under a year. I think these changing tax laws
will also encourage investors to look harder at projects they are
comfortable Holding for over a year, so some of the pump and dump
energy will fade. feel free to get in touch with my trusted broker
davislingardcrypto11@gmail.com and he will be sure to provide you every
necessary info you may need to invest wisely in bitcoin and alt coins
.



When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because
my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I
began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more
than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and
can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got
to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this
done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market
outburst in December 2019 was more than enough for me to have a belief
that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some
trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading about
and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I
was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market.
I invested in some coin that eventually ran out of the market in 2019
it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i
wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of
the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video May this year where I
saw some individuals showering praises on this trader Davis Lingard,
so I contacted him his trading signals are really accurate unlike any
signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making
sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet
you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my 1BTC into
5BTC in two weeks and three days I was so amazing because I was tired
of constant losing of my coins here is his contact via Email

inquiries and other insights into trading."

14077,"Nice shot  Mate. Bitcoin a new bearish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see now the market is very unstable , the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just holding and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hold and sell but rather the potentials of trading  BTC would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started tradn with Prof Kingson Bill  since late last year and to date have made over 18 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey. With Prof Kingson Bill  counsel I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin, You can easily get to Prof Kingson Bill  on ?? l???a? {( @KingSonSignal)?? for Crypto related issues."

14144,"Bit¢σιи price is prone to volatile swings, making it historically popular for traders to speculate on .  
According to bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run, so, if  the PI 
indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull  run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively 
close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year. lnvestors and traders find it 
difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market,  hodling is profitable but tradlng is far more 
profitable.  I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough, I didn’t think it was 
possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across @Bernie Doran’s program for lnvestors/newbies 
who lack understanding on how tradlng Bit¢σ!и works, to help them stack up more Bit¢σ!и, since late last year

14237,"Talk sense, or else shut up because you don't even know a fucking word or function of technical analysis. Try to learn & gain some knowledge for yourself first than suggesting the community which you have gained. NO HATERED at all Its just that you yourself know that whatever you're saying here is nothing new nor sensible. You're saying that if ELON MUSK says that he's going to buy DOGE???? let me clear you something ELON MUSK has 28% holdings of DOGE COIN already. Think what would happen if someday he books the profit and of course he will, why won't he? Also as of now we don't know anything about what DOGE coin would offer like other coins have their products & road map. So I would say to wait until ELON says something positive about the coin & If he does, then you can consider to hold a long position in it..... ""Just book the profit don't set high hopes for now"""
