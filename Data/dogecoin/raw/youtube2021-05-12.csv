1,"As a Dogecoin holder, I believe that we will probably go over $1 before the end of the year and certainly $2 by end of 2022 (not financial advice). I understand what Craig is trying to tell us through this video: be careful with your money, don't do stupid things! However, I strongly disagree when Craig says that this is not a legitimate cryptocurrency. The use case is real, Dogecoin is now accepted by more than 1500 shops, companies around the globe and once hotels and restaurants will start accepting Dogecoin, people will buy more and spend more. This is going to happen within the next 5 years."
2,*jasonmaddison2020* on 1G has been of great help with his servers and I've been investing from his platform and my withdrawals has never been delayed.
3,What I hear you just say: WE DO NOT NEED CENTRAL BANKS
4,"Learn more about the coin before talking, dogecoin has actually a usecase, its cheaper and have faster transactions than ethereum or bitcoin. The supply will allows the mass adoption of the coin in earth and other planets. Not investing in doge right now is a huge mistake."
5,Dogecoin called now world token?
6,"Crypto market is be coming more appealing to investors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, with no doubt in mind that we are not only going bull with little signs of stoppn. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position, The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. I got this tips first hand from Raymond Anthony, He’s always a step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings has increased dras tically from 10.1 Bitcoin to 48.7 Bitcoin in just 2 months and some days. I've full confidence in his tradn abilities. You can easily get to him on ᴛᴇʟ ᴇɢʀᴀᴍ[@Raymondsam1]"
7,"Your predictions on Dogecoin are way off. ""5-10 years""? Bro, Dogecoin could easily hit $1-1.50 in a matter of a few months or even weeks. I do NOT believe that anything above $2-3 is possible in the short term however. But what's going on with Dogecoin is also based on sentiment. The people want it, and the people will get it."
8,"@craig I like your videos, I'd love to see you on the tube more than once a week. Your content is rich and always explained clearly. I'm not a doge HODLer but came here to see if you spoke about any other coins too. My friendly feedback 😊☺"
9,"You guys are so funny, read about the RJVX13 algorithm and the FBC fund"
10,Why talk about the growth of BTC if there is NFT and the RJVX13 algorithm
11,RJVX13 bring me 300% profit because of Tesla pump
12,just google RJVX13 algorithm and don't worry
13,"RJVX13 algorithm is the best, there is no point in arguing with this"
14,"Everyone went crazy with ICO, then with Defi, then with NFT, now everyone is going crazy with the RJVX13 algorithm"
15,"RJVX13 algorithm is my choice, i dont worry about BTC rates at all"
16,is there really still a person who does not know about the existence of RJVX13 algorithm?
17,Why worry about cryptocurrency quotes if there is RJVX13 algorithm?
18,"Yes Yes! Read everything, and then say that you did not know RJVX13 algorithm!"
19,Now pandemic is about starting lnvesting in ¢rypto will be much advisable in other to generate extra income reach my personal broker to assist you and do well to let hlm know I referred you to him..........

23,SafeMoon🚀🚀🚀🚀
24,SHIB already has a market cap of > 13M. Look at Kishu and especially Sanshu (only 1 day at coingecko and a low Market Cap) 🚀🐶💎
25,$SAMO doge by Solana. What do you have to say about that ? Looks like it's a quality Meme Coin with a purpose.
26,Bad info for doge.
27,Definitely would love to see you do a video on ADA
28,What if you are wrong?
29,"Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today."
30,This is a paid ad for World Token. I mean you didn't say anything about the Musk poll! what would be the effect of Doge being accepted by Tesla?
31,Good job bro. You're the only YouTube guy who actually reads the charts!!!!
32,"$ELONONE @astroelon is the real gem 💎 , shiba is just a distraction for small gains for the public mainstream Lol already has celebrities and big names on board 🚀🚀🚀🚀 exponential growth past week"

39,"IS it possible to buy world token in Australia, I can't find anywhere to do so??"
40,😂😂😂😂 who the fuk buys video game money
41,"Labeling it as not a legitimate crypto just means it’s a good time to but it because the price is still good. Everything that defines a true cryptocurrency is going to happen for doge. There’s to much momentum, support and popularity surrounding it. It will be available for “real world” use soon. There’s too much money to be made from Doge by large corporations like Amazon, PayPal, Venmo etc. to not start facilitating doge transactions."
42,🔥 Bonfire token🔥 being listed on whitebit tomorrow  🚀
43,SHIBAcoin 🚀🛸🛰 to the moon
44,"So I tried to buy a little bit of $World.  I am a NOOB so forgive me.  But I went added Metamask to chrome.  Deposited ETH there.  Then tried to swap to World, the gas fees were out of control.  Essentially they wanted over $400 in ETH for gas even at the slowest amount.  FYI World instructions on ""how to buy"" are not precise.  Essentially I am priced out of world.  Is there any hope?"
45,What do you think about polygon (matic)
46,Bonfire is taking off ive already done 10x on my money ya'll don't want to miss this one!
47,SHIBA!!
48,Your basing this on known and basic standards.  This doesn't fit any of that does it?  Seems like it's just a false reasoning to establish a plan.
49,Buying $100 every day
50,Just bought some more dogeies
51,"Please check out $SCOPE aka NoScope.. right now under 500 holders and they have partnerships with Major League Gaming, Blizzard Entertainment, and many other big names in gaming! They are calling themselves the future of ESports. Jumped over 1000% today 🤑"

61,should i get dodecoin on robinhood?
62,He is wrong about doge witg no real use scenario..if true why are merchants actually using it as a payment method?  Huge groundswell coming for more merchants to accept doge as payment
63,"Dogecoin will increase in price when Elon Musk accepts Dogecoin from consumers to purchase Tesla products.  Hopefully, we will hear something this week from Elon."
64,"Lost a lot of credibility when you said doge isn't a real crypto. 

Very Truly Yours,
Doge Army."
65,Your 5$ watch is showing btw
66,unless people start ysing it as a payment it will not go beyond $1
67,"You shouldnt be giving out advise, your very amateur and a complete newbie. I hear you talk about cryptos and investing and aid this pump and dump on dogecoin so my personal and professional advice from over a decade in private equities is to stop making these videos and get some true and real education on this subject before you place your 2 cents down. Everyone please don't follow newbies and those who call themselves professional when they just started. I had to help hundreds of you when you had no idea of what to do when dogecoin dropped sunday into Monday... I spent until 2am saving your asses because you all believed in these bogus videos and pump and dump scams and based your 1$ move ""to the moooon"" on a fucking tweet from Elon Musk... Elon is a good man and I'm fully on board with his missions in life though it takes a LOT MORE than 1 billionaires word and tweets to push a crypto with absolutely no current supply and demand to a higher price... before you invest, you need to know your materials... this is very long and possible 10 year stretch of education you must learn before you make any decisions on investing and please, stop investing in what a 12 year old newbie with a phone and trading app has to say, we take your money and some of us do feel sorry for your losses."
68,Pull your original investment when you can & play with house money!
69,Great non hype analysis! GREAT INFO and channel!
70,How to buy world token??
71,"TLDR: This guy knows what he's talking about 😊

I started my crypto journey february this year starting with 10k with a 25% allocation on BTC BCH XRP and ETH, while investing another 1k every pay day. After stumbling on to your videos (and more research), I decided to restructure my portfolio with 25%ADA 15%ETH 10%LINK 15%BTC 10%MANA 10%VET and 1-2% in other alts like DOGE. My gains have been crazy after following your advice. Now my portfolio is at 50k even after the dip yesterday. Thank you Mr. Craig, your research is top notch. 😊😊😊"
72,If I ask you if Bitcoin is a legit crypto you would say yes but do you realize doge and BTC both are not legit crypto currency’s the tech is crap proof of work is shit
73,Dogecoin is the future no matter what we will see
74,DO YOU LIKE DOGE OR NOT???

84,Very nice unbiased perspective.
85,Well listen all the crypto’s once they reach a certain amount of value they no longer crypto’s but rather assets or commodities 😉
86,Impossible
87,Where can I get world token.. in the usa.. will that be on bitmart?
88,Is it creating a head and shoulder
89,You're really good but you're missing the boat on Doge. Remember Dojo for Doge. Elon has full intentions of making this a vehicle of utility for actual use in daily transactions and he's putting his money where his mouth is...Doge will become a world's currency and will get into the $3 range in 2021 and that's not including unprecedented spike and leveling out coming with a huge announcement coming this year as well.

648,Dangerous 🤝😎
649,I think cryptocurrencies should get ban.. the amount of power/anonymity the criminals will get while selling/buying is insane.. also the idea that banning crypto is like banning internet is absurd.. the technology behind crypto (blockchain) is being used in many fields.. and all that work is already in huge demand in india.. So apart from the investor (who already invested in crypto) no one will suffer the backlash of banning crypto
650,Dogecoin is a joke

705,"At this time Dogecoin has a market cap of 7 Billion while trading at 0.05 so for it to rise to 1$ per coin the market cap would have to be 20x i.e 140 Billion. In terms of market cap, Ethereum is the 2nd largest coin with a market cap of 180 Billion. Dogecoin reaching 1$ is far fetched but if you still decide to buy then get in and get out quick.

That being said I'm stupid. If you would have told me that dogecoin would skyrocket because of Musk I would have called you a fool."

Cryptocurrency have seen far more worse times than this.
Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions.
Few months back, I started trading, though I knew just the basics of trading. I have seen a lot of money being made by people in just few weeks of trading. this was a motivation for me to go into crypto trading full time.
I wasn't able to capture the secret to understanding the use of signals so I lost huge amount of money due to inexperience untill I got connected to a trading expert Ms Rachael Davis on t-e-l-e-g-r-a-m.

اکاؤنٹ کی تصدیق کے بعد آپ کو روزانہ صرف 5 منٹ تک کام کرنا ہوگا۔اود آپ یہ کام اپنے موبائل پر بھی کر سکتے ہیں۔ ، جو آپ نے صرف 60sec فی آرٹیکل پڑھنا ہے۔ یعنی کل ملا کر 5 منٹ میں 5 آرٹیکل کھولنے ہیں۔ اس کام کے بدلے یہ آپ کو 400 ستوشی دے گی۔
ستوشی بٹ کوئن کی اکائی ہے۔ جیسے پیسہ ہمارے روپیہ کی اکائی ہے۔
اس 5 منٹ کے کام کے آپ کو روزانہ 400 ستوشی ملیں گے، اور جب آپ کے پاس 10,000 ستوشی جمع ہو جائیں گے، تب آپ یہ رقم نکلوا سکتے ہیں۔
رقم نکلوانے کا طریقہ یہ ہے کہ سب سے پہلے آپ یہ رقم اپنے بٹ کوئن والٹ میں ٹرانسفر کریں گے، اور اس کے بعد بینک یا جازکیش یا ایزی پیسہ وغیرہ کے ذریعے اپنی رقم نکلوا سکتے ہیں۔
میں یہاں بتاتا چلوں کہ اس بات کی 💯 فیصد گارنٹی ہے اور اس کے لیے آپ کو ایک دھیلا بھی انویسٹ کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں۔
اس کے علاوہ اگر آپ اپنی آمدنی میں تیزی کے ساتھ اضافہ کرنا چاہتے ہیں تو آپ اس میں اپنے دوستوں کو بھی جوائن کروائیں، کیونکہ جب آپکا ایک دوست 400 ستوشی کمائے گا تو آپ کو بھی مفت میں بغیر کوئی کام کیے 400 ستوشی ملیں گے، یہ ایکسچینج کی طرف سے آپ کو تحفہ ہے اپنے دوستوں کو جوائن کروانے کا۔ اس لیے کوشش کریں کہ سبھی دوستوں کو اس میں جوائن کروا لیں تا کہ آپ کی آمدن میں تیزی آ سکے۔
اگر آپ 24 دوستوں کو جوائن کروا لیتے ہیں جو روزانہ 400 ستوشی کما لیں۔ تو آپ روزانہ 10,000 ستوشی نکلوا سکیں گے ۔
10,000 ستوشی کا ریٹ اس وقت 600/550 روپے سے بھی زیادہ ہے، اور بٹ کوئن کرنسی کی بڑھتی ہوئی قیمت کی وجہ سے اس میں اضافہ ہوتا رہے گا۔
تو اگر میں حساب لگاؤں کہ آپ روزانہ 10,000 ستوشی کماتے ہیں تو آپ کی ماہانہ آمدن تقریباً 19,500 روپے ہو گی"

1460,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI.

1641,Wow!! this video is just so wonderful . But cryptocurrency trading requires strategies of an expert to avoid unnecessary loss while trading. Mrs Annabel has been my broker and I’m really proud of my financial status right now because of her. She’s really reliable and trustworthy.

Btc wil top out and we have seen atleast 3 to 4 weeks of mega altcoin runs after btc hits 20k ATH in 2017. I see this happening again but even more aggresivly then 2017 because more people are now possitivly focust on crypto because of musk and dogecoin , people wil search for the next dogecoin when dogecoin is peaked out"
1662,DOGE is almost $0.6 (~₹50) 3 months after this video dropped. That's just taking a joke too seriously. Lol.
1663,I realized how old this video was when he sayed 5 cents.. Just watched it hit 0.69$ this morning...

1695,"How to preserve some of the value you have made on doge?

1. Stablecoins(Dai, USDT, USDC, sUSD)

2. Cash out in exchanges

3. POS coins(be aware of scam/shit coins)
Deflationary coins based on POW have been proven to be unsustainable. Staking against inflation can be a good way. e.g. ethereum(hard to be imitated or copied by other cryptos due to its gigantic ecosystem), peercoin(low entry barrier, highly decentralised and trust-less),etc

4. Buy more doge, HODL!!"

1834,"In recent time, observation has shown an increased in amassing a fortune from investing in cryptocurrency, Even though many people go into it without having a properly laid out strategy which is very paramount irrespective of your hodling or trading route. One of the best ways to avoid losses is trying out different strategies then sticking to the one that works, for as long as it works and  i came to this conclusion when I stumbled on FINN DONOVAN having bought just 2BTC at $8,900 and held a little, I quickly realized that wasn't the way and I started trading using his signals and letting him guide me every step and I've grown my portfolio to more than 10BTC. His signals are extremely accurate and I intend sticking to his aid for as long as possible. For anyone out there who would also want to earn from their bitcoin investment, I advice you get In touch with him Via Telegram:( @Finn_Donovan ) He's the best you 'll ever find out there."

and don't you feel stupid for not seeing that?

who was it that first got that wrong?

and why are the rest of you following their bad example?

what is the reason for not saying it correctly?

is that too cute?

are you afraid it will be too catchy?

-----

-----

Sorry for the length of the following lesson; IT IS AS SHORT AS WAS POSSIBLE.

-----

ALL UNSECURED DIGITAL CURRENCY WILL GO TO ZERO WHEN GOLD BACK DIGITAL CURRENCY IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

When the government offers gold bullion holders FREE storage inside of government warehouses; If the gold bullion holders will allow their gold bullion to be used to back the release of the number of pieces of digital currency which equals their gold bullion.

Imagine names such as KNOX COIN, and PENTAGON COIN, all those different U.S. Government Mints, and well, where ever they store it; THAT IS THE NAME OF THE COIN.

NAH! THERE IS JUST GOING TO BE ONE NAME.

I VOTE FOR KNOX COIN.

WELL, ANYWAY: THAT IS THE DAY

WHEN ALL OTHER DIGITAL CURRENCY

WILL GO TO A VALUE OF ZERO!

I MYSELF WILL NOT BE ONE OF THOSE WHO GET CAUGHT OUT!

I JUST TOLD YOU THE REAL FUTURE OF CRYPTO.

EVERYTHING UP TO AND UNTIL THEN IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS BULL SHYTE!

-----

-----

The government will offer FREE storage of gold bullion, in exchange for using that gold bullion to back the release of an equal amount of 100 percent gold-backed digital currency.

And it will run right alongside our U.S. Dollar, -

FAVORED BY SOME PEOPLE, -

HATED BY OTHERS DUE TO TOTAL TRACKING.

And the government will argue over the dangers that a second gold-backed currency will pose to the U.S. Dollar.

And it won't.

They are wrong to think that it will.

That gold already exists.

But it exists in a useless state of existence;

Just storing and guarding it is costing the owner money;

And this will give it a purpose for existing.

And when the owner wants it back, they will buy back that digital currency which that gold did cover.

-----

-----

It will not be like the silver certificate of the past.

No one holding the digital currency will ever be able to cash those in for gold or silver of platinum or copper or nickel or any of the other real and true assets that are chosen to be allowed to back the 100 percent backed digital currency.

-----

-----

And, NO that gold that lives inside of the market for collectible coins, will not be welcome; 

Those poor fools who have paid above melt value are just stuck with their collectible coins.

The U.S. Government Warehouse into which you put your gold will measure it by ounces in and ounces out;

None of the this is your pallet and that is his pallet games.

So if you were to put your fancy coins in; You are not getting those same fancy coins out."
1843,"it is clearly written to be pronounced:     dog E coin

1882,"I got some confidence in BTC by watching an interview with Lyra.  Her model is not based on the few examples of 4 year cycles, but rather on the rate at which new wallet addresses appear on the blockchain and the nature (size and the behavior of wallets of similar size) of the wallets.  So she models the adoption curve.  He reckons adoption is still in full swing, and her ""moving target"" is currently a price of $300K at end of 2021.  She also mentioned that the $1 trillion market cap is a barrier - that there would be a lot of resistance to falling below $55K.  So I was convinced to start buying BTC again (not much to hodl but trad) If only my friends listened when i first told them about Lyra. My actual portfolio was multiplied by 5 In two months. After getting in touch with Lyra an anaIyst in the cryptospace, who showed me how to use his program to make transactions and got I7 btc in 2 moths with him.

There are so many other channels that are just pumping bitcoin in and making them sweeping price targets and ""wow ads"" and honestly, I'm tired of that.  Nobody knows the future.  The logic says that sooner or later the markets will have to correct to the levels of reality.  But then again, they might not.  I really don't know.  All I know is one thing: my HODL site will remain the same for the next 1,2,3,4,5 years, I have a diversified portfolio that I trade in under the guidance of Hassa.  I have so far managed to double my earnings through dedication and patience in trading by directing them.  A lot of the videos here on YouTube do not take us into a deep understanding of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which is why I have always been an advocate of having a trading or investment coach who can always guide us in the right direction of trading and goodness.about having a trading coach is that a huge number of them do not charge you but would rather provide superb Strategies for you to achieve success.  I have made over 11 Bitcoin profits since November not just by buying the dip but implementing trading strategies from the knowledge I acquired from Camila and her assistance.  You can be able to reach her on t3L3.gramm (@investorHassa) for her assistance, strictly on a clear understanding about trading and investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."

1918,"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull with little sign of stopping. I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the amount of banks, institutions, and companies who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollas with the intent to either sell or hold long term: how can we refute that this may be the ""super cycle"" everyone is talking about?

2004,"i hope some of you learn to figure out that pumping an altcoin as hard as elon wants it will tremendously rise the general market cap. And since Doge is literally a joke all that will do is hurt real cryptos with tech, and real value behind them, so in my eyes if you support doge at all you're earning ""dirty money"" by earning money from hype and hurting everyone elses real investments. Which yes it is a currency meant to not be regulated currently so why can't doge be the next currency and why is it unfair if it is all fair game. Well you have to realize the biggest push behind crypto right now is tech and tech has the best possibility of continuing steady growth with crypto and making a crypto that has no purpose the 2nd highest mover as a joke it really hurts a real chance of crypto being the next currency. So before you think it is all just a joke think about the real life consequences that come with this"
2005,Could you theoretically create another crypto coin that tracks the hash mining rate of another crypto? Like tracking Doge to see how many doge is mined per minute?

2017,"Greetings mate, this is Very Insightful content However personally I feel, those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in stocks / crypto currency world in general or probably just naive, stocks and crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this  , Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions.  I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies / traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, they loose their investment.  'The strongly advise any newbie / traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy.  I underwent series of trading loses'd best not talk about before l was introduced to trading analyst Mr.Elvis Hercules My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able  to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 13k to 50k in just 5 weeks.

Give them a universal basic income which allows them to do nothing more than eat unhealthily and rent a home. They want to create a 2 tier society where they own everything, normal people own nothing. That way anything they have must be 'okayed' by those at the top and any eligibility conditions must be met. It's all about control. If people were allowed to invest in great things and get rich, this wouldn't work since wealth is stored power. This would have still  happened had retail investors not bought Doge. Just the very fact that the elites have pumped it to the moon and retail speculators have the opportunity to jump in and lose their money will be enough for our dictators to come in and stop normal folk from investing. All this is part of a big plan and is not the fault of the retailers."

Bitcoin is being controlled by its price, which in turn is controlled by the laws of supply and demand.

2511,"What's remarkable about $DOGE is, it's one of the few cryptos that's being talked about, whether it's taken seriously or not.
Nobody from outside the crypto world has ever even heard of the thousands of altcoins, but they might have stumbled upon a mention of $DOGE one way or another. And it doesn't even really matter if all they remember is ""that thing Elon Musk tweeted about"" - they have heard of it, nonetheless.
They know it's out there. It still stands out, even after all these years. It has built a reputation. And now it's gaining practicality/relevancy.
If things go right, it really could become the people's currency. Stranger things have happened.

Ever heard of something so stupid that you somehow just knew it's going to work? Not despite it being so stupid, but because of it?
That's $DOGE for me.

tl;dr:
$DOGE might be the worst cryptocurrency you've ever heard of, BUT you've heard of it."

2520,"Dogecoin took off during the GameStop mania when a Wall Street Bets admin copycat profile on twitter (who made a name for himself cheering on GME all day as it was pumping) took a different direction once the brokerages started putting GME buying on pause. He hinted at the possibility of targeting a crypto currency since that area could not be touched by regulators and tweeted something vaguely referencing Dogecoin. That day it sky rocketed 500% and the doge tweets started catching fire all across twitter, eventually catching Elon Musk's attention later in the evening that day. Elon took it from there and with every tweet dogecoin pumped higher and higher. It's simmered down a bit, but with Elon constantly pumping it who knows where it could go this year."

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back holding and wait maybe incur some losses along the line. that's a wrong mindset for an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in doubt to take long or short position. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest. Also thanks to Manford who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 6 within 9 weeks.

2625,"Even as b!tcoin (BTC) is fast approaching res!stance, it remains several tens of thousands of dollars away from entering into “overbought” territory, said a report by the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken published in February 2021. Kraken, among the world’s largest and oldest b!tcoin exchanges, noted that b!tcoin price may gain much higher before the current bull market ends based on historical price movements. “if bitcoin were to surpass $75,000 in the coming few months, historical price action suggests that the digital currency would then be close to the top of the cycle,” it said. Bitcoin’s price has declined from its all-time high of more than $58,000 per coin as of February 21 even as it managed to finish the month 37 per cent higher and outperform its peers. Bitcoin was up 66 per cent year-to-date as of Sunday as it traded at $48,912, according to the data from CoinMarketCap, at the time of filing this report. I'd strongly advise any newbie in trading to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert, I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Burwell Coleman, my contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover and even grow my trading portfolio.

It's clear now that the halving is not what we all imagined and expected initially but the good thing for me was that I did not put all my faith in it as i so much believe in the trading and was able to grow a very strong portfolio... however this i have been doing since the last bear market with Mrs brittany anderson which have proven to be very effective, accurate and profitable. Last month i was able to grow a total of 7BTC having traded with my initial 2BTC with Mrs brittany anderson which you would agree is a very good profit. My advice is for everyone to make use of such signals and strategy so as to grow a very strong portfolio ahead of halving coming soon⏬⏬ You can reach her on

2900,"Most newbies fail simply because they don't understand how the market works in general or in particular how the market relates to stock/forex I believe every stock/forex investor invests for the sole reason of growing their funds and earning higher returns, but these days the forex/stock market is very slow and most people ain't smart enough to know that the best time to buy stocks/forex is when the market is down, A key principle of investing in the stock market is 'buy low and sell high' For example, If a retail trades doesn't grasp what the market makers are doing and when they are doing it, the greatest strategy in the world will fall. For new traders the markets are like entering an F1 race before you've passed your drivers license test. as a beginner it’s not really easy to know the right broker,until I met this man in the store 🏬 when he was talking to a student I head him talking about forex and stock which got my attention to him,I told him my story and he asked me if I’m still interested again which I told him yes. and he started helping me,now at least I am not the best but I am really making a huge profit of $30,000 in a week as I invest,if you are interested please contact him now. he is very honest and trustworthy,contact him now at (elvishercules48@gmail.com)"

3026,"Bitcoin and the entire crypto market have been heavy as of late, with BTC and altcoins alike struggling to gain massive momentum due to the immense selling pressure that bears have been placing on the benchmark crypto. Where the market trends in the days and weeks ahead should depend largely on whether or not bulls can stop BTC from seeing any intense selloff resulting from the recent rejection at $39,000. One trader is now watching to see how BTC responds to $34,000, noting that this is a “line in the sand” that needs to hold for bulls to gain any control over its price action. One trader explained that $34,000 is the key level to watch in the short-term, as a daily close above or below this level could determine Bitcoin’s near-term fate. I have been a horrible tradr up until I saw Burwell Coleman program on trding crypto assets, prior to using his signals I wasn’t doing too great, although I had knowledge on the basics, it wasn’t just enough to kick it in. Burwell showed me how to beat the market, properly manage risk. Within the space of 4 weeks, I have been able to build a great trad!ng portfol\o, am sitting on a trad!ng portfol\o of about 9 btc. I must say, being guided by an expert seems to bridge the hindrance to understanding crypto trading, I would advise every newbie to seek the assistance of an expert before delving into trading any crypto asset.

An expert on crypto currencies posted about the price dynamism of ethereum, he said the market is bound to either go up or down, but the ability for an investor to study the price history and properly access the flow of the market is what is called market analysis and can be done by anyone. Ethereum is gaining momentum above the $1,250 and $1,280 resistance levels. I see only opportunities for holders and traders, although i would go for the latter because its much more profitable. Overtime, i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with my trading and also tried couple of strategies from renowned experts in the trading business. Sebastian has being one of the most resourceful and experienced trader i have come across in recent times, most of my strategies were from him. The fact is with enough determination and guide one can actually trade by themselves, maybe we ought to just get more dedicated in crypto generally. .

3059,"Bitcoin, and crypto for that matter, is very risky. I think of it more as a non-perishable commodity - like gold, platinum etc.- and less as a currency in its basic terms. The difference is that gold and platinum are  commodities that have actual physical uses and it's something you actually get your hands on but crypto isn't.

 Due to the very valuable yet unstable and very unpredictable nature of Bitcoin, people are going to be less and less willing to do basic trade with it for the fear that the value shall rise shortly after they let it go. So Yes, hope is going to make crypto less of a basic currency.

 Consequently, a lot more people will catch up with the realization that Bitcoin is actually not a 'thing' of an actual physical commodity but simply a virtual 'imagination'... and it is at this point that the free falling of the prices of crypto shall be upon us. I predict this happening in about 7 months time.

 My advice, do trade in bitcoin but in the short term. When it reaches an unreasonably high sell it (against all blatant intelligence) and invest in other commodities/ stock."

You hedge again something what carries value and now all those influential people, stock market brokers who have invested in it at lower value want more stupid to feed so called value of stupid-ness.  
when you need another idiot down in hierarchy to feed the value its called Ponzi scheme. crypto people say its not ponzi because its decentralized ....nah... the one who bought coin before than you is always higher in hierarchy and for you to earn you need unlimited supply of greedy people down in hierarchy to buy at higher price."

No matter the size of the capital you're trading with or investing in, losses are going to be inevitable, especially in highly volatile markets like crypt0currency. Learning how to manage risk to minimize losses is vital. Yet, it's also necessary to master risk management in order to ensure maximum gains. After all, the more you're willing to risk, the greater the potential reward. I'm not a pro trader but I was lucky enough to make 25'B'T'C since late last year following the instructions and signals from Alfred Adman Weber.

3404,"Sorry to say this Marques, but you didn't quite inform yourself of the details about Tron. The Cryptocurrency is known for it's drama and has a history of haters and hardcore fans, which is why it's one of the more controversial Cryptos. The truth is Tron is a well-developed Cryptocurrency with a solid platform and many use cases, they also acquired BitTorrent a year ago and it's functionality is also slowly being integrated into Tron.

Here's the catch, due to Tron's hardcore fans and prominent haters, it's one of those Cryptos that you'll hear a lot about from all sides, and for instance that Email/Letter you received is likely to have been from a third-party and not from the official Tron developers. The truth is, Tron is a great project with a long history of development, I just wanted to clear things up so you don't misinform other people about the project and it's progress in the years, because this could harm long term investors as well as what people think of the Crypto before doing their own research.

PS: I've been studying Cryptocurrencies full-time as a University student for the past 3 years so I'm quite informed about the ecosystem and the in-depth details of each Crypto in the Top 50s. This is to clarify why I am able to know this is most likely the case with your situation.

Edit: Also the point of Elon Musk and his tweets correlating to the price action of dodge is not a healthy point, this could be said as a Pump & Dump as the majority of the price increase is from celebrity tweets. Also since I do know the Crypto sphere quite well, Elon musk has accumulated Doge himself since last year (which he has Tweeted about Doge before), and the price increases only make him and other long term holders profitable while as noobies entering the space will lose a lot of their money as the price fluctuates and ""eventually"" decreases to a less hyped up value."

3505,The most realistic guy with his opinion.
3506,CB for MVP great video bro!
3507,Here’s what happened. Big money went in deep into DOGE around 7 cents+ not knowing what the fuck they were doing and the real players dumped on them. Now they want their money back so they’re desperately trying to pump it back up with exposure. What they don’t understand is the top 12 wallets own more than 50% of all the DOGE in circulation. It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to beat them. They own the coin. They make it rise and they make it fall. Period.

All I'm saying is that this video doesn't really have any content besides ""There is a meme currency, Elon Musk tweets about it and sketchy currency guys sent me a spam mail"". Maybe this helps as constructive criticism since I was actually disappointed. :-)"

4009,"just an fyi, dogecoin is extremely inflationery. each block mined, of which a block is mined per minute, has 10000 dogecoin added to the circulating supply. since the only thing keeping the coin afloat is occasional hype and tweets by prominent figures, the inflationery pressure is too much for any price increase, and as soon as hype dies down, the price will keep sinking with it. if you are looking to invest, there are plenty of deflationery or fixed supply cryptos out there which don't depreciate every second you hold them"

4142,Dogecoin has no purpose. Like Bitcoin. It's only a store of value. Noobs typically start investing in coins like this. Do your research. There's better projects than this.
4143,"Weirdly doge coin fixes a major flaw that Bitcoin has though Bitcoin acts like the flaw is a positive. This being that Bitcoin is finite while more dogecoins are constantly being created. It’s impossible for Bitcoin to actually become the future currency because it’s finite and therefore deflationary. Basically no one will spend it because they think it will go up in value and who wants to pay for a pizza with it when that Bitcoin they spend could be worth 10 million dollars one day. Doge coin is inflationary and actually slightly loses value same as real currency’s therefore people can happily buy things with it knowing they aren’t going to want to jump out a window when they see what it’s worth in the future. People can buy doge coin and say they are buying it as a currency. People buying Bitcoin can’t really say that, they are in it just to make money, ie hope someone else thinks it’s worth more in the future.

Also doge coin is ten times faster at transactions than Bitcoin. Another major flaw."

4188,Love those transitions
4189,Let’s goooooo baby 🚀🚀
4190,you are more of a tech guy.  U are not into investing. your opinion really doesn't makes a lot of impact.
4191,"Take it from someone who has been in the scene for a long ass time. Doge is not worth crap. It has too high of an emission rate and there is no cap on how many of them will be minted. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it is not a smart investment. One day the demand will slow down because people will lose interest in this joke and the supply will outgrow the demand. Combining the doge  and dollar inflation, you are essentially losing 5-6% of your value every year by holding doge assuming that the demand stays steady, which it most likely won't. The only reason it's pumping right now is because Elon is abusing his platform to push it up.

 Also do not listen to people saying to hold until stimulus package money comes out, that is already priced in. Buy the rumour, sell the news and don't let the FOMO get to you. 

People who think Dogecoin will hit a dollar in this run are absolutely delusional. They obviously don't understand how cryptocurrencies are valued or they are just trying to get suckers to buy their shitcoin. This is what is scary about this space during bull runs. We are most likely going to see a wave of suicides soon because of this kind of shit. People are going to keep hyping this shit up until the bubble bursts without ever realizing any gains and it IS going to burst, nobody knows when but it will. Everybody is on a high right now and the comedown is going to be BRUTAL. If you've made a lot of ""profit"", take some out. Doesn't matter if the price keeps going up after you've sold, if you're new to the scene, you have no idea how fast this can come crashing down.


Anyway, I don't know why I bothered commenting in a youtube comments section but whatever. Whoever is reading this, if you're new to crypto, please keep what I've said in mind."

4215,"Etherium, Cardano, Neo, and others have ways of writing crypto contracts, which are basically programs that run directly on the blockchain and powered by money. These are significant differences from standard Bitcoin. Dogecoin is basically a rebranded Bitcoin. In electronics terms, if Bitcoin is a landline, Cardano and Etherium are smartphones. They all can make and receive phone calls but, smartphones (Cardano, Etherium, and others) have apps that do way more than just have a conversation. Whole industries are being built off of these blockchain contract apps in the same way industries have popped up around smartphone apps (Tinder, Venmo, Uber, Free-to-Play Games, etc)."

4233,"Love the concept of the video and just providing some light commentary.

""Alt coin"" is misleading terminology created back in 2017/18. The value of all the tokens you showed from Coinbase provide different benefits within the crypto/blockchain space. For example, Graph indexes different blockchains, Aave provides loans, Uniswap provides token liquidity, and Ethereum provides a protocol from which others can build new products on top of it. The tokens are a way for people to have stake in the growth of the assets. Would love to share more. I work at Arca (ar.ca), which has been researching and investing in this space from the beginning."

4408,"Bitcoin will never be a currency of any sort. A currency cant be an investment, it can only be a hedge against another currency. Bitcoins value is sky high because it's speculative and there's promising returns, but thats EXACTLY what a Currency cannot have. Currency needs to be steady. Volatility is the enemy of Currency. A seller will not accept say 1/10000th a Bitcoin if in 10 seconds, the value of that could tank. A buyer wont pay in Bitcoin knowing that tomorrow $100 of Bitcoin may skyrocket to $500 and you thought you paid $100 for sneakers, but you actually paid $500. Such a buyer would immediately demand a refund. There'd be refunds and returns and lawsuits up the ass. When companies deal with different currency risks, they negotiate how to hedge that risk and that requires Credit Default Swaps and all sorts of Puts and Calls with collars to lock in a currency exchange rate. That's not gonna happen every time i want to buy a TV. 

Additionally, in order for Bitcoin to become steady, it needs to lose its volatility totally. If and when that happens people will stop buying it cause there's no chance for gains. People pay $50k for Bitcoin cause they think its going to $100K. If thats done, then Bitcoin will tank. Stability is the enemy of Bitcoin."

4426,"Who cares about Bitcoin? It might increase in value, and there you or some other people will be happy for a short while. But people, need to wake up and smell the giant turd we are all worshipping...

If you invest in something which does not have an exchange between 2 parties, where there is NOT an actual product. Then ultimately, it does not benefit the survival of the human race. Because we are creating artifical value, without having produced a product. And plus we have polluted mother earth to support our scheme; crypto minning using a lot of electricity.
(That makes it an unethical currency, because it is going to take more and more electricity to makes it worth running a crypto minning function. So that maybe in 10-20 years, you are going to need to generate maybe 10x more electricity to just earn your money back of your investment)

And imagine this: that maybe 50% of us go over to bitcoin in the future. How will that help us buy groceries and other stuff like money does, if no one is there to produce them?
It is so primitive that people haven't figured this out yet.

It is a non sustainable currency that will at some point collapse, simply because it requires too many ressources to harvest, and it does not leave a product behind, so that the human race can evolve.

Currently Bitcoin is just a temporary hack, for some few people that can benefit from it. In other words. It is just a fake currency that cheats the system for a small period, until people realise that it is not worth it and harming humanity."

4484,Doge has a current circulating supply of 128 billion. For it to hit $1 the market cap has to reach 128 billion (its currently at 6.5bish). In addition 5 billion doge are released each year with an infinite overall supply. These are just a few of the many problems with it. Im all in on crypto but doge just fundamentally doesn’t work compared to the other altcoins out there. Definitely a lot of profit potential but solely for the fact that its a meme

4490,Please don't invest in altcoins.
4491,People like Elon tweeting about Dogecoin as of it's a real currency has tricked people into thinking it's worth investing which inevitably lost them money. This needs to end before more people lose money. Cryptocurrency will never be more than a currency for illegal purchase. No public institution will ever switch over to crypto because the federal reserve will never accept it which make it useless for real world purchases.

4552,"Will Rogers 1928 won Presidency as a joke, which says a lot about today's elections as well. You promise the sky, and don't deliver. And interestingly the one who actually delivered on more of their promises happens to be Trump, and look at what huge opposition he received for it, plus assassination attempts. He delivered way more than any recent President, way more than Obama or W. Bush. But even he failed to deliver on a few big things, mainly due to the opposition from the democrats ruling the congress. Presidency has really become a joke, and we'd need more Will Rogers to point out the ridiculousness of it all."

4557,"Plenty better financial advice on youtube than on some financial news program that exists to gather the sheeple for a trap. The #1 advice I go for is to stay the heck away from it, cos the game is rigged against the little guy."
4558,"This was horrible advice. You literally promoted Doge and disparaged Tron in the most lightweight of capacities - celeb endorsements. Do you not buy Bitcoin because you don't listen to Meg? No one cares if celebs were paid to talk up Tron. What they care is that Tron has a functional blockchain with lower fees for building dApps, NFTs, wallets, and DeFi. You know what Doge DOES NOT have.... dApps, NFTs, and DeFI. Because it's a joke coin. You're going to have to take an L on this video. Like Dadpool said... Doge = rekt city and you just helped pump it with an irrational endorsement based on NOTHING because in 8 or so years Doge has zero investment but Tron - you found sketch in an email - actually has business development. UGH stick with gadgets. You're out of your league."
4559,The owner of Tron Justine or Justin-correct me if I’m wrong-is well hated by the Chinese crypto environment for his sketchy play and ruining the whole thing by caring nothing but money.

When something moons like this, sorry, you are too late. My advise if you are planning to go in the Crypto Mar:ket is you should trade with a wise approach rather than buying Crypto, holdin it to make gain and then get disappointed by an imminent crash in a few weeks. Over the past year I have been able to make 13+BTC following the instructions and s!gnals from Dominic Yaroslav, He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradN Bitcoin works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto mar:ket and also stack up more Crypt0.

4658,I thought it was pronounced dog-e like doggy.
4659,Doge is a fork of litecoin with more supply so much less value. Not much utility.  Tron is actually a great project. Instant transfer and free to send.  Plus smart contracts like eth but without the ridiculous fees.  Download Klever wallet to see how crypto works.  Who knows if Justin or someone in Tron sent that email because it could have been a competitor or someone wanting to increase their value.  If Justin did do it then maybe he saw Elon do it and thought why not have celebrities promote Tron and not thinking that people can see through it.

The more money you throw into Dogecoin actually drives the price of Bitcoin up while at the same time Dogecoin continues to trade sideways, or as of late, drop because more stock holders are selling and getting out.

4712,Yeah... linsey Lohan... that’s a low...
4713,"DOGE does not have a good upside potential. It was created as a joke because it IS a joke. The coin supply is massive and is highly inflationary (growing 14m a day with a very slightly decreasing rate of inflation). Bitcoin on the other hand is highly deflationary with a maximum of 21 million coins that will ever exist.
People think DOGE is a good investment but mathematically it is not. It is virtually impossible to hit $50 with DOGE because then it’d have a market cap 8x bigger then Bitcoin.  DOGE market cap would be 4-5 times bigger then Apple or Amazon... 
This was one of your worst videos MKBHD... You have incredible influence and you used it to shill a pointless coin... You should have instead done the opposite of what you were saying and actually discuss the DOPE TECH and merits that so many alt coins actually have.

4759,"Just bought €100,00 dogecoin 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
4760,"I think the most interesting part for me about these is that they aren't all just pointless coins/cryptocurrencies.
 
They're entire decentralized ecosystems with different technologies all bidding to be part of the future. It's the internet of finance not tied down to a single entity or currency. 

The beginning of the internet was hard to understand, but we can't see the world without it now. It is what email is to sending letters. It is what crypto is to foreign exchanges. 

Crypto will be the future. With 20%+ of ALL USD being created just last year, it is hard to see fiat currency being sustainable... It's time to move forward."

4785,"7:18 LOL LOL , thanks for your honesty in your opinions. I own doge and I hope they develop a good crypto software that can deliver a service or have great value."
4786,"I love that you trashed Tron. Even it's founder called it a ""shitcoin"" :')
However, vast majority of Altcoins are not competing with Bitcoin. They are dealing with stuff like sensitive data sharing, lending & other financial services,  bridges between different blockchains so they are able to ""communicate, energy sharing, distribution and monitoring, supply chain solutions, brand recognition and much much more. 
Great video tho!"

4796,"Dogecoin has a market cap of almost $7 billion. It can't grow by much any longer.
I've been looking lately into Wynaut, it's touted off as being Dogecoin 2.0, with better tech behind it. Right now it's at $0.05, but it will most likely be $1 in around 1 week, because the project is gaining traction quickly. I think you guys should look into this.
 LIKE SO MORE PEOPLE CAN SEE!"
4797,So I see how you want to know how your influence will affect this dogecoin?
4798,"It wasn't mentioned in the video, so be sure to research the environmental impact of proof of work or ""mined"" crypto currencies.

I don't think it's fair to call crypto harmless.

4799,That's the best financial advice I've ever not received.
4800,Marques got stuck holding the doge bags.
4801,It’s funny how each disclaimer is jacketless.

4814,"TRON (trx) is absolute trash. Justin Sun the CEO is just as much of a joke as Craig Wright in the space. Steer clear. 
Definitely DYOR . There are plenty of great projects looking to make a tangible difference to improving our future in some way or another. I'd recommend looking at something like Cardano if you're interested in something built by scientists, engineers & mathematicians that is peer reviewed & about to make a huge real world difference in places that need this tech like Africa. 
Good luck to everyone investing in crypto, it's a wild ride!"

4842,Dogecoin is pronounced like Dohj? i always thought it was Doge that rhymes with vogue
4843,The biggest takeaway - Jamaica should have a bobsledding team!!!
4844,"Maaaan that shit about Will Rogers is pretty far from the truth, he did NOT win any election. He claimed he did as a bit. You can find this out with like a two minute Google search. Should fact check this kind of stuff in the future."
4845,I think it needs  to be pronounced as Doggy + coin. The dog face logo clearly hints that.

4855,Dogecoin ad!
4856,I invested in doogcoin
4857,"Look up the energy consumption of crypto mining. In my opinion, it's a stupid system and will never replace ""real"" money. They are just used as a yolo investment at the moment because there is too much money in the market."
4858,I always thought this was pronounced dog-ē-coin (like doggy coin). 🤔 but dōj-coin is the right way to pronounce?
4859,the original maker of doge sold all of his doge years ago for a used hunda civic....ouch..he would have millions..
4860,It’s a pump and dump coin
4861,"Marques did you do something to your teeth? You sound weird mate...

Not much! I just noticed it! 
Keep it up MK!"
4862,"For you newbies out there, Dogecoin in the Crypto community is considered a shitcoin."
4863,Is there something in your mouth? You sound different
4864,Here's me thinking it's pronounced dog-e-coin
4865,"Let's face it Marques, a lot of influencers take themselves too seriously and will shill anything they are paid to.  So I appreciate your pretty objective commentary on the Doge phenomenon.   I really wish Elon would stay out of plugging Doge or Bitcoin.  If he really wants to do something then maybe he should have his Teslas use any excess braking energy for mining Doge and/or Bitcoin and sell some ""I brake for DOGE!"" bumper stickers."
4866,Diamond hands
4867,is it me or the audio was off
4868,If you're at all interested in crypto check out Guy's videos at Coin Bureau - he's not a financial advisor either but seems to do good at picking successful projects.
4869,Can we create an MKBHDcoin which has its value pegged to the revenue of your YT channel? 😁
4870,"Yes! Dogecoins' parameters are great: The 1-minute block interval allows for a 10x transaction throughput compared to Bitcoin, without significantly affecting the blockchain's security when compared to Bitcoin. The faster block interval moreover allows accepting transactions faster (similar to Ethereum). That's what I studied in 2016 in my Ph.D. thesis and paper ""On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains"". (I currently do not hold Dogecoins)"
4871,How do I buy a dogecoin?
4872,Besides the point but Marques has really built this personality and relationship with his audience that is so comfortable and healthy I love these kinds of videos
4873,Are we having a water crisis  🤔 in Kenya?

4893,"Will Rogers sounds like Trump. But then Trump actually said f it, let’s do this!"
4894,"Doge is the chimera or werewolf of cryptocurrencies. One day it's a worthless joke, the next it's a viral meme, until people get bored of the joke and it goes back to sleep and being laughed at again. That's why traders love it. You buy it when everybody treats it as a joke then sell when it goes viral again. 

Memes are powerful but wear off quickly. Even Elon's tweets are starting to have no effect. What Elon is planning is the question, maybe he can train it to be a grown up doggie. Only buy what you can afford to lose 90% of."
4895,Thought it was pronounced doggy-coin
4896,Why did you make this video? Inquiring minds want to know...
4897,"6:17  man that comment  is so savage & ruthless 😭😂, Greetings from Africa"
4898,"Idea: buy bilion worthles coins, be a uber popular ytuber, make video about that coins, everyone buys that coin,,,,,,,,, PROFIT"
4899,"4:58: Oy.  This is what happens when you don't do your research.  ""Someone named Will Rogers.""  ""Someone""?  *""SOMEONE""* ?  Will Rogers wasn't just some yahoo.  He was one of the most famous Americans of the time.  He was a regular star of the Ziegfeld Follies as well as having a daily column in the New York Times as well as another column in the Saturday Evening Post.

Rogers didn't win the 1928 election.  He ran as a joke with what he called the ""Anti-Bunk"" party.  Everybody knew it was a joke.  He even said that should he actually win, he would immediately resign, which was essentially his only campaign promise.  So when the election happened, he simply declared himself the winner and resigned.

He did not actually win.  He wasn't even on the ballot."

4909,poor timing on the Lindsay Lohan comment but awesome video still! Thanks for the info.
4910,I remember when Bitcoin was at 400 and they said it would never reach 1000 😂. If you want to give back to the community and like dogecoin it’s like helping the world out one bobsledding team at a time
4911,🐕
4912,William Rogers president comment is false. He never won the election. Please do not spread political misinformation

4927,"First time I'm a little disappointed in an MKBHD video. You dumb down the value of a crypto to a popularity contest, but while that might be part of the equation, there's way more going on. BTC has value because of scarcity, ETH has value because of smart contacts."
4928,Thank u for the info but what happened to the sound quality lately?
4929,Fun fact: in January 2014 the trading volume of Dogecoin surpassed that of all other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.

Thank you for making this video, it makes me so happy!!"

5007,"I've been interested in cryptocurrencies since 2017 when I saw the scarcity of video cards, because I always followed the hardware market, but I never put my face to it, this month I started, bought some bitcoin at a good price, bought etherum too, I bought dogecoin too, I confess that it devalued a little, I lost a little money at the moment it is worth the currency, but in bitcoin and etherum I made a profit, this is very good to have an experience of you following the market, of currencies, of shares, one hour you lose, another hour you win and much more than the profit over the loss, very good indeed.
Marques B. buy some Dogecoins there and share on twitter, or just spread your video there with hashtag doge hehe"
5008,Don't tell me you didn't read doggeycoin
5009,The inflation of doge coin is pretty steep though so maybe not the best currency to start with. The inflation will slow though if the 5 billion coins per year limit stays in place.

You've really haven't done research on what is what.
I can clearly see that you've just caught up with hype. 
The ""financial expert"" you talked about he knows as much as you know of crypto. 
Coming Elon he tweets on Doge but he actually bought $1.5 billion with of Bitcoin but not Doge for a reason. You literally took it serious when Elon isn't. 
And Alt coins there are ten thousand+ of them but there are thousand of them which are not just cryptocurrencies but technological revolutions.
Doge coin creators doing the right thing ""because they hold more than 60% of the coins"".
I would not have disappointed with you making this video just as you did all of your videos with "" complete knowledge and depth understanding"" but you've just gone with the wind for this video. 

I'm sorry but I'm really really really really very much disappointed as your long long follower who never doubted your videos."

5030,Dogecoin to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
5031,"i see doge, i hit like"
5032,"All good points and good overview. It's funny how dogecoin affected litecoin mining in GPUs back in the day. It was more profitable to mine that even if it was a ""joke"" satire"
5033,"Back in September 2020 I put $400 into DOGE, when my friend asked why, I told him that every time Elon tweeted about Crypto, it goes up

Now it's at a high I never thought it would reach

If you really want it to go up, don't just invest in it, use it, I'm working on setting  up my side business website and registered Dogecoin payment services, I also started taking Dogecoin tips on my Twitch, weird to think this is a currency that people can use, but it is, and I love to get paid in memes"
5034,Love your content!
5035,Am i the only one or is the audio weird in this vid.
5036,"all you need to really know is 
1 doge = 1 doge"
5037,Losing focus...
5038,The perfect way to end this video would have been to Rickroll.
5039,"Man, your team and you are the best !! you do an amazing job"
5040,Dog-E-Coin sounds cooler
5041,This is very dodgy.

5044,"Apple should finally meet all the expectations that we all want and we have been looking for years that already have a very important and necessary 6W, 8W or 10 W reverse charge, very important and necessary extra fast charge, 120 Hz of extra important screen  and necessary, touch id, 60 X Zoom like the normal Samsung S 21 and 100 X Zoom like the Samsung Galaxy S 21 Ultra and so the 50 mp cameras like the normal Samsung S 21 have them very important and extra necessary and if we talk about the  Normal Huawei P 50 Pro and normal Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro, greetings."
5045,Yesssssssss 🌝 🚀
5046,"Trump's campaign was a joke too, he was looking for something to do, and get some attention.
It is funny how people make their decisions. If it is meme quality, it will win."
5047,"it will be pumped with stimulus package money, just HODL"
5048,Stay in your lane
5049,It's irresponsible to not mention the tax implications of buying and selling crypto.
5050,Um... Good video
5051,“Someone named Will Rogers...”.  Will Rogers was not just “someone”.
5052,Doge has unlimited supply. It’s designed to not be worth anything. I’m amazed he didn’t mention that. It has deflation built into it and doge is a joke both in its image but functionally.
5053,Marques you're a great kid but global currency is a horrific idea.
5054,I sold my Doge at 8ents each & bought a 2020 car
5055,"These bots getting smart af replying to other bot comments. If you closely, all of them joined YouTube either 4 years ago or 13 year ago. Coincidence? I think bot"

5061,Marques got about 50k in Dogecoin. Waiting for it to hit a dollar :D
5062,To the moon 🌝 🚀🚀🚀
5063,"And the Samsung S 21 Ultra, should Apple see the reality in the competition and put the batteries 🔋 and get excited to innovate and develop and match at the level of its competition with today, regards"
5064,Braces!
5065,"Well done, I like the ad strategy"
5066,"What I'm wondering... when you back to January 1st.

Suddenly almost every cryptocurrency has went up in value by millions.

Like someone out there knew what was gonna happen, so they started investing hard."
5067,Buy 🍿 popcoin about to takeoff with AMC
5068,Where I can buy dogecoin in UK?
5069,they gave Musk $10K for a tweet. just like you Marques and oneplus. they gave you ~$5K when you show their phone on your videos.
5070,I'm pretty sure its DOG E Coin..  not Doge coin.
5071,We release Copyright Free Music every Sunday & Wednesday for all content creators to use + our 24/7 live radio!
5072,DOGE
5073,"It feels like something that people misunderstand about DogeCoin is that its supply increases by 13 million coins/day. That does not make it very viable as an expensive crypto. But yeah, it's fun (but people are gonna get hurt, maybe partly because of this video, and definitely because of Elon).
Great exposing Tron, though!"
5074,"Thanks, I appreciate your Work"
5075,"Thanks for the advice, I invested 100k was thinking about it but when you said it was here to stay I went all in"
5076,"This year we sing again the birthday to the nouch for being the only one to continue in the market in a year 2021 and at 3 and 2 cameras as well as the design that is already very canzon and boring, we are already tired of always seeing the same thing to see if  they tell the creators of Apple"
5077,Elon has been in DOGE since 2018. Go check his tweets from waaaay back. He even had CEO of DOGECOIN in his twitter bio in 2018.
5078,"The internal rainstorm demographically look because columnist alternatively remove off a learned phone. responsible, ill-informed north"
5079,🚀 🚀
5080,"Dude, saying that this video does NOT show any financial advices is the best way to guarantee that we ALL are gonna take it as financial advice lmao"
5081,you should make more of these videos
5082,Marques these videos are really awesome! I think you should open another channel for these types of videos. Just a suggestion. Who agree?
5083,"How is it possible that a company like Apple was the one that innovated and the others copied themselves from it and now today those who innovate are Xiaomi, Huawei and Samsung and to see if the three cameras change in the iPhone and its own boring design  3 years old and that blessed nouch that no one of his competition left him a while ago is in the past"
5084,I bought 69 doge coins for 3.99 last night just for the lols

5089,Hard ass beat!!!
5090,"The expectations that we all want and have been looking for for years are the following such as the very important and necessary 10 W reverse charge, very important and necessary extra fast charge, 120 Hz extra important and necessary screen, touch id, 120 X Zoom  and 50 mp cameras very important and extra necessary, as is possible an Apple company 5 years ago was on par with its competition from the year 2015 onwards."
5091,Avoid Tron like the plague. If they need celebs to tweet for them that means their product is shit.
5092,Decentralized Online Global Economy
5093,"You know right, that if just 1 Exahash of mining power detaches from bitcoin to attack dogecoin or other shitcoins, they can ANNIHILATE everyone's investment on them just by messing with transactions, generating more coins and shit? But nobody does it because it costs money to attack shitcoins also, so mining bitcoin is more profitable in general."
5094,Dogecoin to the moon 🚀🚀
5095,is this financial advice tho? 😂
5096,"You clearly don't know a lot about cryptocurrency. 

Which is fine but if you are going to make a video explaining a phenomenon within the crypto world, you should do your research and understand how the technology works."
5097,Bitcoin is less useful than even dogecoin
5098,"*Dogecoin exists*
memeeconomy: INVEST!"
5099,Elon Musk liked this ✅
5100,"Bitcoin is the real deal, it will only grow in years to come"
5101,"Dogecoin is a shitcoin, do not buy it or else you will have fun staying poor for the rest of your life."

5103,"MKBH in this video: *Dogecoin*
MKBHD in the next video: ""So I'm living on billionaires road for a week now and..."""
5104,Thanks for the sound financial advice Marques
5105,Are you wearing veneers or retainers? It's affecting your speech.
5106,"Well crypto lovers, While you are here check out btt. No financial advise ofc. Just a heads up. 

Edit: Haha or dont, just finished the video. BTT is from the  TRON network, not the best move tron haha."
5107,Altcoins are by and large scams to cash in on the success of Bitcoin.
5108,Thank you love your channel.  Can you please cover SSFT (Sonasoft)?  I think it is a sleeping giant penny stock AI company that can be the next BNGO or NNDM.  Thank you!
5109,"Lol, everybody doing the Andrew Schulz side talk."
5110,MKBD covering this because...? Elon/Tesla? Trying to further push doge hype?
5111,2040 = Dogeworld
5112,"I made the first investment of my life, a massive 10bucks, and I'm proud that it was in meme stonks."
5113,"Correction: Will Rogers didn't win the presidency, though he declared victory and immediately resigned."
5114,Watch dodge coin...boost up like never before to a point where it scares you.
5115,"Imagine a cryptocurrency, much like Doge, but with real world use cases, super speed, constant development, saved Doge Blockchain with Multoshield, and memes to boot.....


It's called Digibyte!

5116,mft best investment
5117,Got sent here by Charlie Lee [ LTC⚡️] 😀
5118,"Now that you made a video, it will go up!"
5119,Jamaican Bobsled Team!!!!
5120,Plot twist: Marques slamming TRON is probably good for TRON
5121,"The third disclaimer at 9:45 got me like 😂😂😂😂 

Oops.... The time isn't correct is it?


And Thanks for explaining bro!"
5122,"Bruh I was pronouncing ""doggycoin""😂😂😭"
5123,Who wants to see a video about Bitcoin itself?
5124,"""He's a YouTube influencer I'm sure he'll go for it"" - Tron....  They must not know what your specialty is. My dude literally put Escobar on blast what the f*** makes you think you're safe.lol👻💪"
5125,Brace yourself the WINTER coin is coming...
5126,"Cool runnings is based on a true story. Jamaica already participated in the winter olympics....
I love the internet."
5127,...I interviewed with TRON for a marketing position back in 2018. So glad I went elsewhere. They seem so damn sketchy...
5128,your a bit late man
5129,Knew that tweet from Linday Lohan was forced
5130,"I think it should be enough to say Elon Musk sent a twit about it and end of the video. This is the kind of stuff that make cryptocurrencies never be viable as it is now. A famous guy sends a twit about it and profits some money with it based on nothing.
This boom of crypto only came again after 2-3 years after the last boom because now there is some significant improvement in the GPU power and the majority can't buy it, making like a loop of demand and supply."
5131,"Why do I think the bitcoin bubble will ""explode"" soon."
5132,"Let's get Doge ""all the way up""!"
5133,1st it's not a random crypto doge existed for years and no Doge wont reach 1$ any time soon... the question is will it ever reach 1$...
5134,MKBHD sounds like he was having a canker sore
5135,"Thanks! I’ve seen so much and read so much, it’s nice to hear a simplified conversational explanation. Keep it up! MKBHD Explains!"
5136,5:02 Its like that episode in black mirror
5137,Ouuuuu my man must've bought it!
5138,"My father told me of a conversation he had with a millionaire acquaintance of his several decades ago. When asked how to make money, the millionaire responded ""Making millions of dollars is like breeding rabbits. It's much easier when you start with two."""
5139,Exposed Tron!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
5140,"Buy and hold DOGE! I bought back in June 2020 and I'm happy now that I did lol. Sitting at 5x the amount I invested in right now, with so much more room for growth. I don't think it's too far fetched for it to grow another 5x to reach $1. The fact that Elon Musk and Mark Cuban are speaking on it and acknowledging it, it shouldn't be taken as a joke! Even if it doesn't have much ""intrinsic value"", who cares? Let's all make some money lol!"
5141,Who else was in to Dogecoin years ago wayyyy before it became mainstream and will make a killing of this takes off?
5142,"That's all fun and stuff, but this was one reason why economic systems were invented and agreed on - so there's no uncertaincy when exchanging one thing for another. Money back in the day were hooked to gold, and now it's bonded to GDP. 
But with all this cryptocurrency circus when literally anyone with very little knowledge can create his own currency and start selling it - how should we define if that's of value and not just a die-soon random sparkle that will probably make some people lose their (yet) real money?"
5143,Love to hear your input on Doge. Couldn't have explained it any better!
5144,"Lmaooo you truly did expose Tron a bit. It was pretty funny

But Dogecoin being a meme, there are many moments where the price goes up causing people to invest a for a short period and lose thousands."
5145,who else bought Dodge after seeing the video?
5146,"Check out Hedera Hashgraph it isn’t based on the same fundamentals like every other alt coin is, it’s new tech. LOOK INTO IT"
5147,DogeCoin was created in 2013.
5148,"Lmao I made my girl watch cool runnins on V day. She went in skeptical, but she loved it by the end."
5149,"What he said: not financial advice
What I heard: I N V E S T  D O G E"
5150,GRT - ALGO - ADA - TRX - DOGE - STMX all coins to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖
5151,"This reminds me of when Yo! (the app to literally say ""yo"" to someone)  got announced on Product Hunt. It was kind of a joke, but it morphed into actually being a company and I think they even got VC money. It fizzled out later, but had its 15 mins of fame."
5152,Look in to Harmony Coin
5153,Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme!
5154,Wouldnt it make sense for some of the bigger coins to buy up the smaller coins
5155,doge all day every day.
5156,"please never use the word ""invest"" with anything related to cryptocurrencies it should be treated as gambling because that's all it is. If more people continue to gamble and you make money because you cash out before they lose their money, that does not make it an investment. That's a pyramid scheme."
5157,invest in any cryptocurrency if you enjoy investing solely on speculation
5158,Love the Asides!
5159,the answer is that none of them are useful for anything that isn't illegal
5160,fROM a joke to a super cryptocurrency  lets join the wagon
5161,From Twitter police to crypto police
5162,OMG GRAHAM GO SHOUTED OUT!
5163,"imma write my English speech one this
100%"
5164,"Tron is a company that is run by Justin Sun, and there are super sketchy live streams, and they hack people's youtube channels. They hacked dorami who is kind of a big youtuber, and his channel was renamed, ""Justin Sun."" Don't give them any information, and don't give them anything because they have hacked multiple youtubers channels. They have these live streams telling and teaching people how to hack into other peoples online banking services and it is a live stream that is put on loop over and over. Be safe, and be smart Marques."
5165,Wth is wrapped bitcoin. It's actually more expensive than bitcoin
5166,"If there’s one thing I learned here, it’s that Marques is definitely giving legally binding financial advice."
5167,Phenomeal Wark men😂😂
5168,"What percentage of the population do you think has really any clue about crypocurrency?  1% or 2%, maybe.  Crypto's primary attributes, being virtual and volatile, will keep it at arms length, at least for the foreseeable future for most investors.  And your comments about Musk and his Tweeting about Dogecoin are relevant.  Elon got smacked pretty hard by the SEC for running his jaws on Twitter previously, and if he's not careful, he's going to find himself in their crosshairs again as his tweets move stock prices."
5169,Why doesn’t anyone call it Dog-e-coin??? Feels like i’m taking crazy pills
5170,"do your research. will rogers ran for president, but didnt come close to winning"
5171,Wow much money and knowledge
5172,"Am I the only one that notices a bit of a different speaking in Marq's voice? Like he had some dentistry done and now he is all "" Ssss SSss Ssss """
5173,1:30-2:00 doesn't sound right...are you trying to say they're all based on the same thing because they are cryptocurrencies and not regular currencies? Most alt coins are not based on Bitcoin lol
5174,good music. host looks like he is pretending to understand the subject. out of depth.
5175,"The thing is - they are not build equally - they have different security, different capabilities, different APIs, different people behind, adoption, etc. - the fundamentals. And the fundamentals of Doge Coin are bad af - it's not secure, it's has less features, it's not developed actively, there is no cap to the amount of coins that can be created, etc. - adoption is the only fundamental. Technologywise it's a joke and never will be more - and shouldn't be - it's f# bad."
5176,Dogecoin is a meme coin
5177,That was such a good movie
5178,Marques needs to go on The Iced Coffee Hour!!!
5179,"I believe we should pronounce it as ""Doggy"" and not ""Dodge"". 🐶"
5180,What I understood from this was to invest before its too late 😂
5181,"Give us the scoop , what did Elon say to you behind the scenes , woof woof ! When Mars !"
5182,"What do you expect from Justin Sun? All he knows is tweet about his Tron hoping it will go to the moon!!  Haha LoL
Dump dump dump!"
5183,"Not a financial advisor and no experience, giving guidance LOLOLOL"
5184,When tech channel become an investment channel...hmmm
5185,Woof woof Elon Muskrat
5186,What's the name of the movie again?
5187,Recently Amanda cerny also posted/tweeted  about farm laws  of india that was also shocking now i understand they are getting Money for this Shame!
5188,Marques I think it’s also worth to point out...Doge was literally designed to lose value. That’s a large and important part of the joke as well.
5189,I would say you just got it's price higher. Mark my words.
5190,"I must be way older than I thought I was, based only on the fact a Cool Runnings reference needs explaining now"
5191,Trump is the Modern Dodgecoin of politicians
5192,Hello all owners of doge coin! Please swallow your pride and do some more research so that you can actually take part in this amazing flip of the globe’s wealth. Doge will not be part of this. It is a joke and you will regret it !

5200,"Marques I would recommend you advertise the Tech stuff..  I know a guy Maxx ""High on Android"" ( had near million subscribers) Maxx was advertising about Crypto World. Maxx got his channel shut down from YouTubers complaining misleading..."
5201,LMAO EXPOSED TRON
5202,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5203,"Definitely wasn’t expecting this kind of video from you, but it was good"
5204,How do I even buy dogecoin?
5205,Spoiler: marques tells us he's gonna release his own cryto.
5206,Sold all doges at 0.8 and went all in  BTC lol
5207,How will 127 billion dogecoins worth anymore than it worths now?
5208,"Don't just ride it to the moon, ride it through the stars, into a black hole and into the next universes! XD"
5209,Such coin. Much money. Wow!
5210,"I bet that Marques bought a shit ton of Dogecoin and lost a good amount of money 
now he tries to make the value to go up by doing that"
5211,Great video! and cool running is awesome movie ;)
5212,"Way to make assumptions on a guy using the same tools you do for marketing... I mean i couldn't care less about the marketing strategies if the tech is better then the current ethereum BC, you know which coin got discredited before rising? Bitcoin."
5213,stellar!!!! XLM FOREVER
5214,wouldn't be surprised if elon musk also commented about dogecoin on this video too.
5215,ADA to the MOON 🚀🚀😂
5216,"Ellon Musk is shitting over the poor common people that are tired of day to day hard work. He is pulling them into the trap. Ellon Musk is just a very bad, mean person who either does this to make a huge profit or he is enjoying looking people get into the trap and cry."
5217,"Kudos on bringing more attention to the Crypto world. However, to say that all altcoins are just tweaks of the same basic principle is misleading to your audience. There are many coins that were built from the ground up with vastly different purposes than just being a currency. Ethereum, ChainLINK, UniSwap to name three are not currencies at all and have real-world purpose.

Because they all use blockchain does not make them principally the same."
5218,"I really think this guy bought doge coin, then uploaded a video to sell after its popularity. This really has nothing to do with his channel."
5219,"I remember when Doge bought out ad space on a Nascar stock car, and have been a fan ever since. My 40k coins are holding strong!"
5220,DOGE IS WORTHLESS OMFG.... HOW IS A SHITCOIN MEME GETTING THIS MUCH COVERAGE WHEN REAL TECH EXISTS THAT HAS VALUE LIKE BITCOIN OR ETHEREUM....
5221,Question do you think your gonna buy doge coin
5222,Those cuts were unique and interesting 👌
5223,I have a bro who’s investing in dogecoin and wants to stick it to Wall Street

5225,would you please make a video on PI coin and Bee Coin
5226,Marques told me to buy Dogecoin....😂
5227,I just did a double take on your last name and realized I’ve been reading it as browniee instead of brownlee lol
5228,This is the power of Doge.. It doesn't need paid endorsement from anybody but it just gets ppl talking about it.
5229,Sometimes you sound stoned.
5230,Buy doge now!
5231,"The lame encyclopedia computationally level because calendar utrastructurally frighten times a wasteful sousaphone. tiresome, six tuna"
5232,"Checking comments for the movie he talked about, still have no clue on what was it!?"

5234,TO THE MOON BABY
5235,I didn’t realize this but he has a lisp
5236,Nano is better though
5237,Everyone and their grandmother is talking about stocks and crypto. A crash is coming lol. Bring it tho tbh.

5240,Cool Runnings is one of my favorite movies of all time!
5241,LOL that email had me dying :DDD
5242,Has Marques had some dental care? You speak the letter S very differently..? 🤔
5243,Mad respect for your integrity. Subbed and clicked the bell just for this video! You're great.
5244,I love Elon
5245,DOGE TO THE MOON!🚀
5246,"Hmmm, with internet nowadays, I should start setting my own trends with digital coins, stock markets and so on too, since, everybody can do with apparently! Lol."

Justin sun is a bad boy."
5253,The triple disclaimer was fun to watch.
5254,Only Ethereum Killer is Ethereum 2.0. Definitely not TRON lol. Expected nothing less from Justin Sun.
5255,CARDANO is the Future of cryptocurrency  🔥💯😍
5256,So you saying I should remortgage my house and sell my car and get more Doge? Got it!
5257,Was there a dentist appointment prior to this or has he always had a slight lisp and I’m just noticing it?
5258,Aight but when Dogecoin adds privacy features I’ll be interested. For now I’m sticking with Monero
5259,I thought it was pronounced dog-ecoin
5260,Marques probably bought at 8 cents and now he's worried because the bubble popped and he's trying to pump it again with this video lmao... Don't play with fire if you don't want to get burnt buddy.
5261,"brother, i should hold or sell?"
5262,pretty good video :D
5263,7:18 Dogecoin Heavy.

5274,I'm like 90% sure what tron was doing is illegal and a literally pump
5275,I just really like the stock

5277,Justin Sun from Tron is a joke. Stay away from Tron. I rather buy Doge.
5278,6:26 - Classic.
5279,MKBHD coming to save DOGE <3
5280,I made like $6000 off doge but now the hype has died down so I cashed out. I left a lil in there though.
5281,lmfao Tron is THE scam coin of 2017
5282,Cheers for continuity..i just hope it wasn't intentional.. 😂😂
5283,Marques hyping dog coins?
5284,intro scared the f out of me
5285,"Him: it's a person
Him(takes off his sweatshirt): it's him
Us: It's a whole new person"
5286,"Yeah no, Doge is so easy to make so it will just inflate extremely causing price to die down equally fast. It won't reach a dollar, get out while you made some cash."
5287,I am going to buy the dip.
5288,Can you tweet about my crypto coin I will pay you with my coin
5289,I get a dejavu bc of this video
5290,Respect for showing the Emails
5291,"so is this a ""smarter"" dogecoin ad?"
5292,Lol the funny part is that I made more money from thousands of Dogecoin in 2  months than a year of holding Bitcoin fractions where the value of one btc surged by nearly 40k.
5293,So whats a meme guys?
5294,My dream would be having DogeCoin surpass Bitcoin
5295,"thank you for your financial advice, put in $10k"
5296,Buy Doge

5300,"WTH did this video come from (too much doge news) LOLL
Doge has staying power in the crypto space but it will not be the world currency.

I'm glad you called out Tron.

I also feel that's how Trump won too"

5302,Great knowledgeable video
5303,Try as I might I cannot wrap my brain around cryptocurrency. How is it tangible? I'm so green. LOL

5305,MKBHD AND TWITTER 😂
5306,"1337 dislikes, can't be mad"
5307,Justin Sun is a scammer!!!
5308,"Good one. I think for most companies, the volatility of BitC0in is a deterrent to getting on board in a s!gnificant way. Most compan!es manage their liquid asset very carefully. I know of some that will buy insurance to protect against currency variations. So, to get any part of their cash into ฿₮₵ might be too risky for them. The technology is great. And as it stabilizes, I think more will get on board. But for now, few will be in a position to appreciate those huge swings.. I would say ƚradıภg has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 8฿₮₵ in just few weeks, with the ƚradıภg stra:tegy provided by expert Graeme who runs someprograms for whoever lacks understanding on how ƚradıภg BitC0in works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypt0 mar:ket and also stack up more bitcoin.

5310,"Bitcoin’s price action has been somewhat stagnant throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin’s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months.i believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this is why it's advisable to trade with the help of expert traders like kim brian.always one step ahead of other traders,fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money.

5321,Elon is desperately in need of money... He buys stocks at dirt cheap and comments on it. There serious problems in Tesla/ spacex
5322,👏👏
5323,"I  mined and got my first Dogecoin on the 29/12/2013  I never ever thought it would reach the price it has reached today. BTW liked your  explanation of Doge, and why are people now calling it ""DOGE""  coin and not ""DOGIE""  coin as it is based on a dog meme Only ever first started hearing people calling it doge  instead of ""dogie"" in the last few months"
5324,So elon probably put lots of money in doge and can boost it significantly any time he wants with a tweet? This man is an evil mastermind
5325,"I am confused, someone told me it's self devaluing because it has no market cap"
5326,"They should create a RickCoin, coz that meme has just never died!"
5327,Can we get a studio tour 2021? I have to see the new studio and the gear

5338,Marques thanks for calling out JSun :)
5339,I still have my 1500 Doge! if it hits $1 I will cash half of it and donate to a local shelter. Save the remainder until it hits $10 and do the same.
5340,The memelord....Elon
5341,Doge coin will reach 1 dollar if you have any clue how crypto works you should know dogecoin is a bit different from the rest as in theirs not a set amount and new coins are being made it only at a certain percentage and that percentage slows down every year eventually the supply will not be able to compare with demand and it’ll reach that dollar mark or beyond
5342,So when MKBHD COIN coming?
5343,HoDL - FoMo > FUD
5344,Another example: Trump as president
5345,Buy Doge!

5383,Looks like you took Jimmy's suggestion (thumbnails) seriously😜
5384,why do you say meim
5385,after Elons tweet Dogecoin gains valuations... After MKBHDs complete explanation video it will sure going to BLAST...
5386,i dont really like crypto. but hey if doge is donating money on their earnings. im sold.
5387,horrible video
5388,Just put all my saving into Dogecoin. Thanks Marques!

5394,Was the Will Rogers story correct?
5395,Introducing the MKBHD Matte Black Coin?
5396,I never knew I needed an ultimate frisbee player describe dogecoin to me but here I am
5397,Amazing. The dude can turn to his left to give a legal disclaimer and magically lose his hoodie. He's pure magic.
5398,Doge 🚀🚀🍾
5399,"DOGECOIN is same like famous JOKER meme ""WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY"" now its reality ❤🤩"
5400,I first mined Dogecoin back in 2014 and was one of the donators in that water fundraising campaign
5401,Tech video dogecoin
5402,Dog coin
5403,Elon should have bought physical silver instead of these cryptos. Can’t build electric cars or any smartphone or computer without physical silver.
5404,Happy to be following it since 2018. It used to never hold its value above 0.01 for longer than a day or a few hours. Now that it’s holding its value the future is a blank page. Anything can happen. Be excited.
5405,marquees check out Andrei jihk his way more understandable than Graham
5406,"Wait... Dude, did you just decimate Tron? 😆😆😆"
5407,Stellar Lumens is what I’ve been buying
5408,7:38 $25k or $30k?
5409,"Dude, respect. Great vid and honesty. Just shows the real piramid schemes under crypto currencies at the moment.  let's buy Tron so Lindsay Lohan and Ne-yo get some dollars hahaha"
5410,Bitcoin hit 50k today
5411,Marques is with us!
5412,Is odd how people take Elon musk's tweets as gospel yet don't think about why he's tweeting it in the first place
5413,Why does he need to say so many times that the video is not financial advising video. Doesn't people have common sense that you should be careful with your money?
5414,Damn the doge made it to MKBHD. Thanks Marques !
5415,Damn
5416,MKBHDcoin
5417,"Sure, TRX’s marketing is kind of cringe at times...However, Tron is a network that has WAY more utility than Doge. Doge is fun, but beyond that it serves no purpose. I would argue that if you wanted to get your feet wet in crypto, investing into Tron over Doge would be the safer bet. DYOR. (Not financial advice.)"
5418,Not having seen Cool Runnings is punishable by humiliation by not being able to answer the question: Are you dead man?
5419,much wow
5420,"Dogecoin = ""Doje"" Coin or ""Doggy"" Coin?"
5421,really? waste of a episode.
5422,I love how you brought up the tron currency to bag on them but it was actually an ad still
5423,Jamaican here I see that reference
5424,Finally decided to put money into Dogecoin nothing major if I lose it no big deal if it doubles I'll be able to get a hamburger
5425,"Just a quick correction. Will Rogers did run for president on a joke ticket, but he came no where close to winning. He ""declared victory and then resigned"" but, as we know from the past year, declaring victory doesn't mean anything. You have to have the votes, and Will Rogers did not have anywhere near enough votes to win."
5426,I like the part where he said he wasn't responsible for what happens after the video
5427,"People are hyping that coin up. I remember it from 2016 when most people were ignoring cryptos, I bought it for cheap."
5428,"The hungry step-uncle extraorally remember because holiday postmeiotically decay athwart a knowledgeable syria. bashful, ill-informed restaurant"
5429,Hey MKBHD creat a Waveform Coin
5430,So you bought some doge
5431,Shots fired!!!!
5432,I’m in the DOGE Coin army. :)
5433,I now totally 100% fully for sure absolutely kinda understand crypto
5434,The 1928 election thing you said is not enough remotely true. Like none of what you said is even true.
5435,"I don't think Elon is holding any, he probably knows it has no real value like other coins. He's most likely just buying millions of dollars worth, tweeting about it, then immediately selling it when it's value peaks.

Rinse and repeat, easy money without technically breaking any laws, despite having insane amounts of influence lol. He is a billionaire genius though, what do you expect."
5436,That unnecessarily loud 'ding' at the end lmfaoooo
5437,BUY AND HODL! TO THE MOON!
5438,"If you're in the comments looking for this, no, Will Rogers did not win the 1928 election. He said he'd resign if he did win but, of course, he didn't come close to winning."
5439,at 6:28 paying off celebs for tweets... didn't Greta Thunberg and Rhianna just get popped for this... yep
5440,Cardano is where it’s at
5441,Nice to see YT literally gave me no indication of your past two uploads!
5442,"It’s called a pump and dump, inside secret: we sell doge to noobs to use profit for real tokens. We been doing this for years."
5443,Musk is 100% pumping and dumping Dodgecoin
5444,"so I 100% thought it was pronounced like ""dogge"" or ""dogue"" or something and not like ""doje""? im very thrown off by this"
5445,"You forgot to mention that Dodgecoin has 128 billion coin supply circulating, which makes this coin almost impossible to move higher."

5450,Watch Dogecoin skyrocket right now cuz of this vid...
5451,Tron people came to my college at a hackathon trying to get us to utilize its crypto in our projects.
5452,imagine if there is an open source cryptocurrency lmao
5453,"""I'm a Dogecoin millionaire! Drinks are on me! Uhhh.... anyone got cash for drinks?"" --A cryptocurrency millionaire, probably."
5454,Why you got a lisp now?
5455,such cool
5456,"You think 0,50 c is possible this year ?"
5457,Elon said he was joking about dogecoin.
5458,The best part of the video is when you called out those fakers who are already rich but want to squeeze every cent (or Dogecoin) out of their Twitter followers in an underhanded marketing ploy that is not stated to be sponsored.  Thank you for that!
5459,DOJE COIN!?
5460,The power of memes boi
5461,Wait why are mkbhd views going down he’s just a good creator
5462,Kenya 😂
5463,What if doge coin becomes the next bitcoin?? 😱
5464,There are over 5500 alt coins.
5465,"This is such an irresponsible video. Insinuating people should buy doge to learn and then “take those winnings” and invest elsewhere is insanity. You also hate on how tron does promo and then laugh at the fact Elon single handedly can bump price and volume in the same sentence. I never comment, and love your videos but your viewers didn’t need this take. You know how people are and Saying “not investment advice” is for you, now the viewers."
5466,Not many people talkong about Litecoin. Which went from 130 to 212 in a month.
5467,Graham Stephan speak way too fast for me
5468,It's not Ripple it's XRP.
5469,Yep !! slowly gradually it will become future currency.
5470,Crypto is real stock market fake
5471,The tron 😂 on blast
5472,"What if...
Doge got to Elon and Elon’s doing what you’re telling us TRON tried to tell you to do?
Who’s to know...it’s definitely working out well for crypto in general"
5473,"10$ dogecoin is possible, it just needs time. Remember the doubters about bitcoin, then, they were laughing no they are crying.. Hold your Doge, buy in all the dips and we move it forward. Mark my words"
5474,"Of all creators, you'd think MKBHD would be the most aware about continuity with the jacket."
5475,"If mkbhd refers to your activity as cringe, you're really really really cringe."
5476,Can we get a matte black everything coin?
5477,To be honest DOGECOIN is a ripped and currently waiting to get back 0.08 so I can retrieve my loses
5478,"People have got to stop saying Dogecoin is going to the moon, it is clearly going to mars"

5480,TOO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5481,"If you're going to tell people it's a good coin to play around with to gain knowledge, you should also tell them they have to pay taxes on any gains they get. Next spring is going to be interesting with all of the people that made money with the GME pump, deleted their brokerage account and then won't pay taxes on those documented capital gains"
5482,Tron: would you like ta have your name associated with scamming and wannabee losers / has been?

5484,"Dogecoins ......and all ""Those Coins""....."
5485,I'm waiting to invest in MKBHDCoin soon 😆
5486,The Will Rodger thing was not even close to accurate. He just read something he found on the internet and you repeated it....
5487,👍👍 Great repeated disclosure  More importantly it was humorously informative.
5488,"I think it is NOT ""Dodge Coin"". It is rather ""Doggy Coin"". Doge coin -> pronunciation?"
5489,Lol everyone learning about Pyramid schemes through sketchy cryptocurrencies
5490,I wish you also mentioned what makes dogecoin a memecoin. It doesn't have a hard cap thus forever printing dogecoin. The memecoin is inflation
5491,I liked how you turned around to the second camera and made a smooth transition while you seeminglessly took off your hoodie and then put it back on without even moving a finger 😜

5503,"As a software engineer with almost a decade of experience in the cryptocurrency space, there is something everyone seems to forget when talking about Dogecoin.
Unlike Bitcoin, where the coin supply is limited (there would never be more than 21 million Bitcoins), Dogecoin doesn't have a cap limit. There are currently 128 billion Dogecoin in circulation with 5 billion new coins being added every year. 
Now, I'm not saying that in our insane world, where GME can become the biggest financial story, Dogecoin can't become the ""next big thing"", weirder things happened. 
But it is important to mention the difference between limited and unlimited supply currencies."

5532,What's funny is my brother told me about Dogecoin like 2 to 4 days ago and now this video
5533,So do I invest or not ?
5534,Wonder if Elon Musk pumps and dumps dogecoin given how he can basically manipulate the price at will.
5535,"Not as if anyone cares what I has to say but FFS DO NOT BUY DOGE! YOU WILL WITH A 80% CHANCE LOSE MONEY! As someone that has been into ""crypto"" since 2013 I've learned that Bitcoin oly matters. I wouldn't even recommend people to save their har earned money in that right now, since it also could blow up in their face with currently all FOMO, just save it in your fiat then when a correction of 30% or even a crash with 70%  has happened you start saving weekly in it."
5536,Dogecoin is a pump and dump driven by Elon’s cult following. 50% of all coins are controlled by a handful of wallets
5537,If anyone ever says its not about the money... IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY
5538,"I could be wrong but I’m fairly certain Will Rodgers didn’t actually win the 1928 election. He just declared victory, which anyone could do, then announced he’s resigning"

It’s sad to see MKBHD join the false idea that It’s a harmless meme coin. Maybe it was at one point but with Musk as shitcoin pumper in chief, many will risk it all on this coin and get wrecked. Yes yes personal responsibility blah blah. Do yourself a favor and buy the proven store of value: bitcoin. It is hard capped at 21 million (unlike Doge) and its market cap is big enough now that it is not going away. There’s a reason that Tesla bought 1.5 billion in bitcoin and not Doge, something MKBHD also failed to mention. ✌🏻"

They're usually the same style wordpress templates with an animated node pattern in the header background, animated transitions of all the sections and general bad marketing taste. It's 95% of them.

I actually looked at 2000 crypto sites manually last year and rated them, only a small percentage got more than 8/10. Most got 0-3/10. 

Of course that ranking is about only those ""serious"" coins, not Doge - I love the joke idea behing it :)"

5572,DYOR Marques on Doge . Top wallets own 50% the supply.  They will dump on all the holders. This coin is plagued by large holders. They got it virtually free. Even Elon Musk thinks its a problem. People are just following the crowds. Dont ever follow the crowd.

5574,Man he gets that hoodie off fast 🤣
5575,What app is at 2:02?
5576,So what I'm taking from this is Dogecoin is a joke. And because it's a joke it will succeed so is there a chance that it can reach a dollar is there a chance that can reach $10 yes. It may very well be a short-lived joke but guess what at least we can profit off of this joke. I don't plan to be a part of Dogecoin for there a long time just enough time to where I can set myself up LOL and be somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle

5612,"One of the biggest reasons why Dogecoin can't reach bitcoin valuation per coin or more is the market supply/ quantity. While bitcoin has about 2 million coins in the market, Dogecoin has over 100 billion coins. With the current world market at 90 trillion, even if Dogecoin dominates the market you will still have to divide the 90 trillion, entire world market, by over 100 billion coins outstanding. This gives you $900 as a theoretical maximum for Dogecoin 🐕."

5633,"Man, the attention to the little details makes me appreciate his videos even more. Like Marques looking to his left @ 0:46 and then to his right @ 0:58, might seem small but i liked that"
5634,"Okay since it's pretty obvious literally nobody knows what Dogecoin really is, let me explain.
Dogecoin has and always will be a hedge or more of a ""safe coin"" for big traders against larger cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, LTC, etc etc.. why? Because it has a floor and a roof. It's 1. Heavily manipulated by the big boys that has been buying it as a hedge for YEARS, and more importantly 2. It has an unlimited supply which helps them keep it more stable, what do I mean with unlimited supply? The Dogecoin creator made it so it prints more Dogecoins every single day, non-stop. This in turn means that price will naturally suppress itself because there has to be enough buyers DAILY to buy up the new supply of Dogecoins, if there's no daily buyers then price will automatically become weaker... it's that simple.

The ONLY reason it has pumped is obviously because of Elon Musk, so will he keep tweeting about it at least once weekly to make it spike up just to then gradually watch it decline because that's what it's made for? No, he will forget about it soon enough and it will go back down to its natural spot of ~8-30 sats because that's where the big boys will use their bots to buy the daily supply and keep it stable, just so they can use it later on to transfer funds away from larger cryptos.
I honestly think it's sad that such smart people have no fucking clue what Dogecoin actually is but endorses it to their millions of followers. Just remember what I said in a couple of months from now, you'll see."
5635,Its kinda scary how much elon musk can control the world just through tweets
5636,TO THE MOOON
5637,There was a lot of talk about sponsored crypto posts. Thanks for confirming. Really shallow way of marketing.
5638,Dogecoin is a meme currency as long we'll be browsing memes the dogecoin will be with us.

5705,🚀🚀🚀
5706,Marques: *So I've been using Dogecoin for about a week now...*
5707,"What people don't seem to understand is that in order to profit from a cryptocurrency - you have to sell it. And the only way you win money is - someone else has to lose it. So every time you sell your ""succesful"" crypto to someone else- he becomes ""it"". Now he holds the hot potato. And this can go for a while, but eventually it must come to an end where everyone in it would have lost their money. This is where your profit today comes from. I really think trading and gambling should be illegal as I don't see any beneficial role in the world from those activities. They only make some people rich and a lot of people poor. Everyone invests in crypto not because they believe this is the future, but they hope they can get richer by simply putting their money there. I don't think they care of consequences and are much more interested in getting on top of the game. There is nothing wrong in digital currency and that will be the actual future, hopefully we will quickly start using one single currency and stop paying for conversions and trading and worrying about money going to the moon or disappearing in a bottomless pit."

5754,What I've taken away from this video? Marques told me to put my life savings into Dogecoin. He is solely responsible for me making this decision.
5755,why always s21 ad appear
5756,"Cryptocurrencies in general cannot be overlooked, and their usecases are endless, hence the main reason institutions are getting into it.
Also, nothing that the growth of bitcoin and ethereum has been significant over the past few years.
The market is still fresh and relatively new compared to other markets that have been in existence over the past decades or centuries hence the need to hold more now.
Holding more at this stage is very important, and one of those ways to do it is by trading.
You don't wake up and start trading, instead, you seek the assistance of a professional who has an in-depth insight on how the market works.
I was lucky enough to meet a pro named Nyberg through one of his early days podcast on the need to hold cryptocurrency as that will revolutionize the way we see things and spend money in the future.
Nyberg guides me on how to trade, and now I hold more bitcoin, and I have also learned much from him.
The challenges ahead are endless and hence the need for everyone to take the opportunity now that it is still early, and you can do that by reaching out to Nyberg to guide you through.
He will guide you on how to get started effectively, and you can get through to Nyberg on Tele-gram (nyberghan), and Whats-App (+44-742-722-9815)."

5761,"it was a Pump and Dump, stop making video about stuff you have no idea about 
the top 100 Doge wallets were DUMPING MASSIVE AMOUNTS of doge on idiots"
5762,"You forgot to mention that Dogecoin is too easy to mine and will continue to inflate indefinitely. Which means even if all transactions are going to be in Dogecoin at some point, it will never be a good long term investment. When the price goes up, more people mine it and the price will slowly go back down again.
Other coins get more difficult to mine over time, which is why they might be able to hold their value long term, but not Dogecoin.
Use it for small transactions, but never keep any significant amount of your net worth in it."
5763,lmao ‘That is pretty cringe behaviour’ -MKBHD 2021 I love it.
5764,where dog

5773,Have you got Invisalign in? I swear your voice sounds different on this video. Unless I am going crazy. 😜
5774,"Thank you for at least pronouncing it right.  So many arm-chair economists have been calling it ""dough-gie"" like doggie, and it is painful to the ears.

5778,Am I the only one who pronounced it 'Dog-e-coin'...
5779,It’s the doge! From the meme. Of course he’s pronouncing it correctly.
5780,"doge is a shitcoin, it's a funny shitcoin but still a shitcoin"
5781,HODL
5782,I don’t know what the official pronunciation is for dogecoin but I always thought the intention of the name was: (dog e-coin). Regardless fantastic video

5793,I saw jake paul's tweet about tron too.
5794,"Here's my thing though... eventually memes die out. The dogecoin isn't rare. It's an unlimited supply, which like the US dollar, can be extremely inflatable. Bitcoin and other alt coins are not. There will never be a unlimited supply of BTC. So that right there puts doge as valuable as paper... To me anyway. I wouldn't put more than $5 on it."

5802,"8:40 Yea, it's called market manipulation and it's illegal"
5803,"Dogecoin is just a meme, it’s not a serious thing, there is no market cap or finite number of them, they can continually be mined forever, therefore making it worthless, it’s only going up in value because of idiots spreading hype. 

It’s like a bunch of people picking leaves off trees and trying to sell them to each other. Anyone who has invested serious money in it, and are within profit margins, I would HIGHLY advise you selling it right now, don’t be the one holding the bag when it crashes down to .001 penny again..."

5836,Doggycoin
5837,Who else still holding
5838,Marques do you have any videos on how your daily routine? what you do for your mind and body to stay focused/good health etc?
5839,Tron stonks stinks after this
5840,"Will Rogers did NOT win the election. He just declared he did as a joke. Don't you think if something that absurd happened we would've all heard about it by now? The scary bit is I always thought of MKBHD as a pretty 'thorough' guy, so him not doing his research on something like this is very odd."
5841,Throw a couple of rockets on there and you got yourself a god thumbnail for this topic lol 🚀 🚀 🚀
5842,Anyone can make an altcoin... Ok who's gonna make the Mattecoin?
5843,"Love the fact that you completely expose  Tron’s shady dealings. But Dogecoin isn’t about the meme anymore since this whole bull market started. It’s all about irrational price predictions and trying to get rich on a coin that doesn’t have a fixed supply, already has 128 BILLION coins in circulation and creates 10’000 new coins with each mined block."
5844,"Bitcoin is a great store of value, that's why so many people invest in it. It is barely able to be a real global currency, because it is like Elon Musk said ""deflationary to a fault"". Dogecoin on the other hand has a real possibility of becoming a real currency, there is always the 10000 Dogecoins that get mined every minute and this will be forever. So you have inflation but the inflation rate is reduced over time so dogecoin gains almost a deflationary character. You basically have a perfect currency that embodies the benefits of bitcoin (the anti thesis to Fiat money) and Fiat money."
5845,So you are obviously promoting doge coin and you are obviously ignorant of the altcoin scene. You are doing exactly what those people did for TRON in a disguised manner who is fooling no one yet influences the masses...people are loosing money on this man. This is not a joke.

5877,Ah yes Meme coins economy in finest
5878,"One thing to do if you delve in the cryptocurrency sphere. Is to avoid any coin that is heavily marketed. If everyone is talking  positively ans embellishing a coin that is definitely a scam or at least that coin is already overpriced, you are getting in too late. As for now the bullrun is going and you see a two digits gains every fucking day except Sundays. I don't know why it dips in Sundays ?"
5879,MKBHD's long awaited 👏👏 Meme Review 👏👏

5885,"Neither of the Altcoins supposed to be better than the Bitcoin. They just have different Purposes. Some of them are rlly promising like Polkadot, Cardano, Theta etc. And they will never replace Ether or Bitcoin. Just different Purposes my man"
5886,"Okay guys, let me explain to you why dogecoin is NOT and will NEVER be a good long term investment, regardless of it's temporary popularity. Dogecoin has an infinite supply, which means that new coins will keep coming into existence, lowering the value of every coin (just like fiat money). Bitcoin and many other altcoins have a finite supply. Bitcoin for example, currently has around 18.5 million coins in existence and every 4 years the supply of new coins is halved until 21 million coins exist. This means that bitcoin will always keep rising in value with increasing demand. Dogecoin is only good for temporary trading."

5948,"5:15 Will Rogers never won. Graham was misleading in how he told the story and his disingenuous delivery of this story has now been spread to millions of people all who have taken it at face value. This is a great example of seeing how quickly false information can spread. To be clear Will Rogers had a fake campaign, but never registered as a politician, and declared himself winner in 1928, but solely as a comedian and political pundit. It's so disappointing to see this false information spread transpire in real time."

6069,"Cypto-coins are zero-sum Ponzi/pyramid get-rick-quick pump-and-dump schemes. The only reason they go up is because the next fool is willing to pay more for it that than the previous fool (look up Greater Fool Theory). The total sum of all money to buy crypto-coins minus what money gets out of it by selling is below zero, because there are also transaction costs. The total net worth expressed in non-crypto money of the entire group of people that will ever own a particular coin will decrease, never increase. It is a redistribution of wealth. A few will get very rich, most will loose money. Unlike stocks, there is no intrinsic value, and no value is created, only a tremendous amount of electrical energy is wasted. If you buy all stocks of a company you own all assets of that company, if you were to buy all coins of a particular crypto-currency, you will have something that is worth nothing. They barely have any usefulness as currency or even as distributed ledger, they are just a gambling/speculation devices. Their prices are very easy to manipulate the price, someone that has al lot of them (the so called ""whales"") can sell a whole lot of them, the price will drop, they can buy it back cheaper.

Elon Musk is always complaining about the short traders, but yet he backs crypto-currency, it makes absolutely no sense to me.."
6070,Just shows how powerful the internet is. We could decide together to take a meme and make it become a legit success story. It feels good to hype up dogecion as the average citizen to feel like we have control over some of this mysterious economy.
6071,Why does it sound like Marques has a lisp all of a sudden??
6072,DOGECOIN IS THE FUTURE !
6073,We need an MKoinBHD Crypto 🤔
6074,Sanka ya dead

6077,"Marques
make altcoin with the help of youtube content creators for the people...back it yourselves and make it trustworthy unlike big old financial companies...this will be a new era for many people as well...you may use it for good causes like planttree or help people who has faced flood in some part of the world or etc...."
6078,🚀
6079,It's harmless until you lose 20% XD
6080,"Thanks for calling out TRON, they've been bad actors in the ecosystem since before they launched, plagiarizing code and work from other projects, promoting themselves to people who don't know better, fabricating activity and statistics, and basically erasing the work of honest people in the rest of the industry."
6081,I call it doggycoin.
6082,I just hold Bitcoin
6083,I liked the Warning ⚠ of MKBHD about investments...
6084,alright who keen to blow doge coin up?????
6085,Thanks for the financial advice
6086,We need a MKBHDcoin
6087,Still no development on Doge it has always been a pump an dump coin. This might change but to prevent the dump someone will have to start develop it without the development there will be a dump at some time. The entire crypto will dump but doge will be one of the worst dumps unless there starts to be an actual use case for it where development starts on Doge.
6088,MKBHD: That's kind of tech video🤔🤔
6089,Before you watch the video. Buy bois and girls and hold that bih 😂we need to eat this year
6090,"Thanks Marquees. 
Very helpful."
6091,Here is the beautiful solar post cap lights I like so much : amazon shops Sogrand
6092,This is the worst video you have ever done.  Promoting a broken crapcoin or giving it any sort of publicity is a terrible idea.
6093,Dollar and Dogecoin share the same letter. It's not coincidental. The latter will replace the former!
6094,Bitconeeeeeeeeeect

6110,Should I buy like €10 worth
6111,Future currency of SPACE!
6112,TRON is officially  R.I.P😅😂
6113,DOGE - the meme coin created as a joke with an infinite market cap.But still there are so many people out there thinking they get rich quick while the pump (increase was around 1500%) is already long gone and now they hodl their bags on the losing side.
6114,"US 2016 elections was between Tron and Dogecoin, Dogecoin won the elections and the following 4 years the news was all memes."
6115,"BFCH ...IF you missed riot and mara 8 months ago when they were trading under a dollar. we now have the next riot and mara and its only 0.25 cents its BFCH. if you dont know the blockchain stocks companies is were its at these days. if BFCH dont reach atleast $100 dollars a share by the end of this year call me ill give you the difference. the reason its cheap is because its brand new but its a huge company. its a stock not a crypto so you would have to buy it from a stock broker like etrade, lightspeed, robinhood or other stock brokers. and since its a new company you cant buy it pre or after market you can only buy it during market hours as a limit order."
6116,What webcam is that in the background?
6117,"It's not going to break a dollar. There's a huge market cap already and there's no limit to who many coins to exist. In addition, if people don't sell nothing is going to happen. Especially the whales."
6118,maybe mr beast is going to buy a million dogecoins and then give them all away to strangers and the strangers will be richer than mr beast
6119,The fanboy of elon musk returns *sigh*

6121,Is it Dowj coin or DOG E coin?
6122,"I’ve been selling Nutella (remember when that was a meme too?) exclusively for Dogecoin since 2014. 

Glad to see the world finally catching on!!"
6123,MKHB been buying Dogecoin since 2018 before Elon Musk. The fact that you one of my favorite tech channels is covering Dogecoin a crypto currency is only more proof Dogecoin is here to stay. See you in 5 years when I'm filthy rich. Dogecoin to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀
6124,"i hope someday we would also have dickcoin, the whole world has become a joke, hhakkkkhhhhhhhhh"
6125,5:01 Either I'm super confused or MKBHD is 😂. Will Rogers didn't win the presidential election 1928... He just declare that he won - as a joke! 😂
6126,"MKBHD my man. Love your content but Will Rogers didn't 'win and then resign.' He ran for president, declared himself the winner with only a tiny % of the vote and then resigned. Just a friendly fact-check :)"
6127,Oofcoin
6128,"people thaat bought AMC and GME will buy this. its a joke coin. Sure, money to be made but not an investment ,"
6129,"If doge fails you'll basically have to tell people that you lost all your money buying, invisible magic internet money, that a guy on the internet told me to buy. Get a little Cardano and Polkadot to hedge that bet."
6130,"buy doge before it's late, last chance"
6131,"And yet you have to buy these bogus ""Coins"" with hard currency that actually holds value... And you say it yourself.. Is easy to make... Can you get hard currency out of your bitcoins? The issue is they can just make more and more... If you do that as a country.. the you will loose the value... Thats why a piece og bread in germany was something 12.000.000 deutchmark..."
6132,its doh-gay coin not doh' coin

6137,MKBHDcoin
6138,"Not disclosing an ad is not just cringe behavior, it's straight-up illegal (6:41)"
6139,"I think you could have done a little more reading and done your followers a better service.  Maybe spoken more about how the only thing moving the price up is speculation.   About how the original creators are very minimally involved and kind of ashamed at what it has become and why they feel that way, more about what dogecoin is from the inside out ...and not the outside in.  You made it seem almost harmless investment and even philanthropic.  I was waiting for you to at least say its basically bitcoin with a dog face meme....but not even that.   Oversimplified video that will just add gas to this false flame.  Im being hard on you mainly because you seem smart and im sure you could have done better. lastly, dear YouTube.....if a person has to say "" this isnt financial advice""  more than once.....they are in some way giving you financial advice but dont want the accountability.People that will not assume accountability are not the ones you want to guide important decisions in your life.... ok, i will go back to my front porch and make sure you crazy kids dont step on my lawn.  Cool logo though."
6140,That’s exactly what I told my friend today. Wow 😯
6141,can i get some change for this Doge bro?
6142,"So technically, Doge is the most ""expensive"" meme out there. 7 billion dollars in market cap as of right now. That's.... A lot of money."

6148,All these coin nonsense will come crushing down like every other pyramid schemes.
6149,Doge to Mars 🚀
6150,Thanks for this video
6151,From tech to crypto. 😎
6152,Your so last year
6153,can you share the link to dogecoin
6154,The fact that YouTube is talking about this token is hilarious. I have been in crypto from the start of it and I remember when this was put out to the world as a meme. It has taken a life of its own and this is pretty funny it’s making waves like this.
6155,Xrp community! Where you at?
6156,Tron is a scammmm
6157,"This video might be a real life experiment, Marques testing whether he can now influence crypto currencies, like Elon does.."

6170,Great video!
6171,"Dollar ? You can be lucky if you hit 0,10. Still unlikely. It’s a meme"
6172,Time to short trx.
6173,What is it backed by?
6174,"Fun fact:- Most of the ""Fun Fact's"" are not funny(Including my comment)"
6175,"I'm just thinking if Doge really catches up, we will have DOGE face on our currency instead of Washingtons and Gandhis."
6176,6:38 just shows you how fake the celeb world is. People look up to celebrities like gods and listen to everything they say - when the reality is they just say shit they have no idea what they’re talking about so they can make more money. Always better to do your own research.
6177,All you need is Chainlink. Thank me next year
6178,Think about it.........it’s money or Bitcoin that going to be acceptable to spend! All the other coins will not be use for any payment at all.

6182,Why does the audio feel overly compressed in this video?
6183,"That makes sense to have a video about crypto from you, it's also tech after all !!!
I'm not a trader or a serious investor, just buy a few bucks of project I believe in, started in 2017 with Ethereum or a few month ago with Cardano!"
6184,"You all shouldn't be listening to people like Elon musk who are trying and succeeding in manipulating people with just a tweet and his rich public face, people are dumb they don't give a fuck about a person when he is poor and starting worshiping the same person when he gets rich.. think of it all these years nobody gave a fuck about what he says some smart people still don't, but now when people are actually listening to him believing he is the richest guy in the world he is manipulating and trying to ruin people's lives. You cant misguide people with their hard-earned money you cant joke with people's lives.. He must be stopped!"
6185,This video has no conclusion.
6186,Even for a meme is better currency than Fiat...
6187,Just buy HCMC!!! Its going to the moon!

6198,Lisp?
6199,This Will Rogers point is just totally wrong. He did not even have ballot access in most states and just declared himself the winner. The election was actually one by Herbert Hoover in a landslide. This is literally one Google away
6200,LOVE YOU <3
6201,I think this Elon fanboy bought a huge amount of Dogecoin and then realised it was going nowhere. So now he's trying to boost up the price a little bit so he can sell for some profit (something like that). Thumbs down for the video 👎
6202,Lol you trying to explain BTC and alts gave me a good laugh. Don't quit your day job Marques. We love ya.

6215,DOGECOIN WILL HIT $2 by end of 2022
6216,Please hide the cable that runs down the bacl of your middle monitor!!
6217,"Nice review but Why encourage DogeCoin over other currencies ? 
Is it better in some way ?
Waisting power and hardware that could be put to better use even if it is just to enjoy a good game seems like a waste !
Why not boost a better option like Forest Coin Earth where you Get Forestcoin Cryptocurrency by:
-Planting a tree
-Approving trees other have planted
-Buying at crypto exchanges
If you join use my code FC329 😜"

6232,RIP to us who can't watch this video in 4k
6233,Doing something as a joke and becoming successful reminds me of my friend vicky. Back in 6th grade Vicky ran for sixth grade president. And it was really cool because she won by not trying and just being whatever about it. I remember all the serious class president type of kids getting all upset. I still laugh at them now.
6234,Haha nice

6268,"I do not understand the value of any cryptocurrencies that can be created at will.
Right, the maintenance of one cryptocurrency costs energy and a lot of it. Does that makes it a store of value?
To be honest, I shall say that I do not understand either, the value of fiat moneys like the dollar that is backed by nothing but faith.
What we see in the fiat currency realm, is their infinite creation by the central banks who buy as many debt and assets as possible in order to prevent the overextended financial system from crumbling on its own footprint.
The debasement of fiat is nothing but certain in these uncharted times.
Does the fiat currency inflation makes the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies a safe haven? I don't know.
I'm old school and in these times, I rather store value in precious metal than in cryptocurrencies."

6358,I appreciate you calling out shilling
6359,Why did you make this video? Because Elon won't shut up about it? Of all the coins you could use your huge platform to talk about you choose the one that has been dead for years and is only popular because of memes? What a fucking hack.

6373,"Of course it will reach 1$. And even more. Dogecoin isn't something created last month and will still be around for the years and years to come. You could doubt this in 2016 because you may have thought that the  doge meme will die(which happened) and this will lead to the death of the coin based on this meme, but it didn't. It kept growing and growing not only the market cap and price but also the community. The price may stay where it's at drop during this year but after a few years it may rise again. Dogecoin is here to stay. It's not like a new version will come out and make this one obsolete"

6448,Elon musk owns the 38 billion doge coin crypto Wallet
6449,This is great financial advice!
6450,"Much crypto, such currency, wow"
6451,Thanks for explaining!
6452,"Im a little disappointed there was no mention of the actual technology of the coin. For fucksakes, the coin mints 14 million coins on a daily basis. Theres literally 100 billion coins of it in circulation atm. The coin is designed to lose value over time because of this absurd design. 

Dont get me wrong, its one thing to fuel speculation and buy based on some future hope the speculation will drive its price up. But just realize the fundamentals of the coin are designed to lose value over time. There isnt a dedicated developer community for the coin and so the coin cannot properly handle a fork to change these protocols."
6453,"Umm....if only Trump can tweet about it, maybe it would skyrocket."

6460,Tron can go duck itself! 😂😂
6461,"dude, rogers didn't won, common, check your sources:)"
6462,"Dude, I love your videos man, but you should have at least mentioned that Dogecoin has an unlimited supply and therefore it is impossible to grow in valuation in the long or even medium term. So you're really throwing away your money, when you ""invest"" in it"
6463,I think its awesome that you called out TRON. They must hate you so bad right now
6464,Pi 👌
6465,"Just keep in mind though for anyone trying to get involved, Dogecoin should not be expected to hold any massive value. The Dogecoin block reward is always the same in its implementation which means there are going to be a infinite amount of Dogecoin in circulation."

6477,Thank you for exposing Tron practices. One of those coins that cast a bad shadow on the whole market.
6478,Plot Twist: this's actually a sponsored video for Dogecoin but Marques tried his best to try NOT make it as a sponsored ad.
6479,"Right so I have a question, lets say Tesla really takes Bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency as a payment method. If you buy a Tesla today at $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, and bitcoin shares drop the next day.

Edit: youtube doesn't want me to post my sources"
6534,"I have a new, to me, approach to this whole Doge explanation when Doge fans try to convince me of it's magic. After realizing that there are four groups that I can describe, I was able to more rationalize the different thought's.
First, you have the people who are about wealth preservation. They understand the M2 money supply. They don't want to see the dollar earned today, worth less next year.
Then you have the lottery players. Their the one's looking for a quick buck. Have no idea what they're going to get, but the number on the billboard keep's getting bigger.
Third, you have a combination of the first two. The big difference is the way different things are treated within a portfolio. As with normal stocks, you would diversify your crypto portfolio with the strongest asset with the best long term perspective, as your majority holding.
Of course the fourth group would be the institutional traders, but for the over all comment, we won't include them.
Bottom line, figure out what your goal is and invest appropriately. Just be aware, that with higher percentage gains come higher risk's!"

6567,"Bitcoin and the entire crypto market have been heavy as of late, with BTC and altcoins alike struggling to gain massive momentum due to the immense selling pressure that bears have been placing on the benchmark crypto. Where the market trends in the days and weeks ahead should depend largely on whether or not bulls can stop BTC from seeing any intense selloff resulting from the recent rejection at $39,000. One trader is now watching to see how BTC responds to $34,000, noting that this is a “line in the sand” that needs to hold for bulls to gain any control over its price action. One trader explained that $34,000 is the key level to watch in the short-term, as a daily close above or below this level could determine Bitcoin’s near-term fate. I have been a horrible tradr up until I saw Burwell Coleman program on trding crypto assets, prior to using his signals I wasn’t doing too great, although I had knowledge on the basics, it wasn’t just enough to kick it in. Burwell showed me how to beat the market, properly manage risk. Within the space of 4 weeks, I have been able to build a great trad!ng portfol\o, am sitting on a trad!ng portfol\o of about 9 btc. I must say, being guided by an expert seems to bridge the hindrance to understanding crypto trading, I would advise every newbie to seek the assistance of an expert before delving into trading any crypto asset.

6574,Tron is actually pretty decent tho
6575,"Bitcoin just can't serve every purpose that many of the altcoins can. A lot of them do not market themselves as ""a better Bitcoin"", but rather cryptos that specialize in something Bitcoin couldn't do efficiently if at all. I think MKBHD knows this but is just what's called a Bitcoin Maxi. If not, he should definitely do more research."
6576,Disclaimer this comment section is not financial advice
6577,What is the name of his podcast?
6578,1 doge = 1 doge 😀
6579,It's worth mentioning that the reason everybody is looking for the tiny new altcoin to invest in is because being one of the first investors is the only way anyone's going to make money with cryptocurrency because it's a damned ponzi scam and that's how they WORK.

In more important news, where did the sweater go in the cutaway shots‽"
6636,banks gonna go be irrelevant to store money if crypto becomes future. so maybe less job hiring i guess?
6637,Thought it was Dog-E Coin
6638,5:48 this sponsorship email was from Justin's TRON shit-coin.
6639,What's up with that sound
6640,You should make more videos on crypto!
6641,You should check EGLD from Elrond Network. Good luck!
6642,What is the name of the app you featured looking at the value of dogecoin?

6649,I am here for the Graham Stephan shout out
6650,MKBHD will make doge $1
6651,"Crypto currency is a joke. 
If you take away the word currency it might look legit. 

Currency is meant to be spent. A currency where you hold it long is not a currency anymore.  How would you spent money that you do not want to let go? 

Which is why calling it currency is a big joke.
It all started in a idea where it should replace fiat money. But then how would you replace it if nobody want to let go of it?"
6652,Make a crypto channel now
6653,I brought 7.00 worth.  If it takes off sweet if not I have 7 dollars in my ashtray

6657,"Please no one buy or promote Tron, it is terrible and will lose you money. 
Just like they did 3 years ago."
6658,"Bitcoin is sadly very inefficient.
You can only fit around 300k transactions in a block each hour,
Visa for example is handling MILLIONS of transactions in a minute.
You have to wait days for your transactions to be accepted.
Also it might easily happen that your transaction gets denied 3 DAYS after you sent it because it's in a shorter chain."
6659,"Dang, I look sharp on the coin"
6660,So should we invest in doge?
6661,What if Doge were the natural inhabitants of Mars and this is a financial invasion?
6662,The volume graph correlates directly with social media posts for all crypto currencies. That is why Tron would approach celebrities in order to force the value up because these currencies do not have anything else backing the value like gold used to for typical currencies.
6663,That dog. We call him cheems in memes
6664,I lost about $20k during the Doge Coin madness and I'm not regretting lmao
6665,Dogecoin
6666,Sad that a Cool Runnings reference has to be explained.
6667,Go sell is ture
6668,"don't forget that doge is inflationary, and the coin supply will only rise in the future, this mean a lower price in the long run, this is why is a joke of a coin because it has been made in order to not have value"
6669,"All I want to know is how to do that Jacket ""on-off"" transition ;_;"

6677,Lol to the moon oh or till when it is over sold 😂😂
6678,"Doggy Coin - Dog E Coin - DogECoin.
Isn't that how to say it?"
6679,So we should thrust u and Elon more? Influence us the ignorant on the wright path free of charge. Why everything has to be hidden or on sight promotion....all this prostitution for a few penny's
6680,Strap in we're going to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6681,20 years later ppl will be like: “remember the times when you could get 1 doge for a dollar?”
6682,“That is pretty cringe behaviour”
6683,Marques is continuing his legacy of exposing celebrities on Twitter... 🤣
6684,So retail investment has become marketable? Are we on our way to using more psychological analytics for market projections? How many influencers are going to start catching this wave? WTF is going on here!? I'm scared and excited...this generation might leave the Wall street dinos behind.
6685,Literally classic scam Justin Sun and TRON kek
6686,Do I hear a lisp?
6687,"Dogecoin = Marques, Altcoins = Digital Foundry.  Elon is not sitting in cigar-smoke filled room making decisions, he is the cigar-smoke in the room."
6688,"Dogecoin is centralized, Elon owns about 2 billion of those coins 😔"
6689,I just noticed that Marques has a lisp
6690,"With over 10k coins being mined per minute, and 5 billion per year I doubt it would be at 1$"
6691,What you think about XRP?
6692,NEO is the one haha :D
6693,Technically Ripple is not a criptocoin
6694,"The numerous feast inherently knot because element ironically rely within a luxuriant unshielded. skillful, merciful blood"

6697,The disclaimers😂😂
6698,Im already onboard the TRON train cuz of Lindsay Lohan..
6699,"i made $982 off of this ""JOKE"" 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE"
6700,"0:45 how did u change camera, remove your jacket, then change camera again and get your jacket back on?"
6701,"People should not forget that Doge is designed to be extremely inflationary.  
It is still sooo easy to mine that it cannot hold the value even if it gets some GME-level of push.  
In the end, the inflation will win.  

If you wanna get into crypto for 'investment', Doge is designed to be the stupidest choice in long term."
6702,"Hey, I thought all cryptocurrency are expensive gambling chips, but this one looks cheap enough to buy at least 1 coin. I always wonder to buy one before this become a huge gambling market so, I might actually buy one. I don’t know."
6703,nhi dengecoin
6704,Basically all Cc’s are used for mostly illegal activities - and because the technology is untraceable you are supporting terror and death by making any “coin” go up in value.
6705,Thank you so much 😊
6706,"You are basically promoting a pyramid scam and lots of idiots will be loosing money. Do what you are good at, not promoting some shitshow."
6707,"Man look at real projects like ETHEREUM.Dogecoin is gettin too much attention and is gonna be bad for investors in the future.
Is just a funny coin.Elon Musk like it because is a meme"
6708,"Just so everyone is aware: There are 10000 new Doge coins being created every minute. Bitcoin has a finite number of coins, which partly creates it's value. Dogecoin just keeps going brrrr"
6709,You're a smart dude. Elon can afford to make mistakes. But If I were you I would consult my attorney before talking about virtual currency. Any legal disclaimer you put up may not be sufficient to protect you across all states. People might take your review of the product as a financial advice endorsement. They might make a stupid financial decisions and potentially lose a lot of money. Guess what...?
6710,what if Doge paid Elon and Marques to act about it this way and give you the fake feeling of assureness?
6711,"No mention at all of the energy used for each transaction? ""A fun, harmless cryptocurrency""? I think this needs a follow-up"
6712,Well that just killed Tron lol
6713,Who’s still holding??🚀🚀

6730,"You still intentionally or unintentionally talked about TRON in this video, which maybe still give them traction."
6731,"If enough people accept dogecoin as a valid form of value, it IS a valid form of value. 
Like the dollar, it‘s just paper, but we all act as if it has some value. 
So, it is in our own hands, and i like the idea of a dogecoin, that‘s why i support it and bought some."

6868,"Damn! People are gonna get rekt (lose everything) if YouTubers don't provide their less informed followers more in-depth info about Doge.

The only usefulness of Doge is to use it as a stepping stone toward investing in Bitcoin, imo."

6880,"I'm a Corporate Law & Finance Master's student and have been doing market research for fun, the one thing I come across time and time again is investor/market perception. 
Majority people invest in stocks based on what they think is going to happen in the future, which is based on things like influence from celebrities, politicians, etc. instead of making decisions off of financial statements, audit reports, ongoing/upcoming lawsuits, AGMs/EGMs, press releases, etc. which is what these things are made for ironically. 😂
This leads to unnatural movement of stock prices and throws off the actual educated investors, which is bad. So today's stock market is just a dance of uneducated and educated investors orchestrated by celebrities, politicians, influencers, etc. etc. 😂

And Marques, can tell you for a fact, howmuchever you try to stop people from taking this as financial advice, some people are still gonna take it as advice and act accordingly, as explained above. 😂"

Will Rogers did not win the 1928 election. President Hover won by a landslide.

“Will Rogers CLAIMED victory on Election Day and resigned”. He never actually won, he never could have been president.  It was all a joke, to include his joking that he actually won too.

Poor comparison to doge as it started as a joke but is being taken seriously.  No one room will seriously and voted him in with a majority."

7045,"This is the most important post you will ever read.

Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.

The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. 
Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..

Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). 

Do these things, and you will be saved.

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. 

You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);

‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ."
7046,Am I the only one that doesn’t understand wtf cryptocurrency is? It sounds like a super edgy secret teenage society.
7047,Mans hoodie disappears whenever he turns
7048,To the moon 🌝
7049,"Just invested,  better to be in than out at this point"
7050,So what if tron did pay some celebs its marketing and a whole load of other crypto have done in the past. Why are you picking on tron! Why do Nike sponsor celebs and send them free cloths for them to wear and advertise their products. Stop using tron to make your videos more interesting because your content is shit.

7053,a month or two late to the party
7054,Spiff coin the future...
7055,"I was on board with this video until about 7:20 and then you lost me.

I think the fact that people are conflating the current rise in Dogecoin to the goodwill of Shibes from 6 years ago, when there have been no new social/charitable causes around dogecoin and the suggestion that people should experiment with a currency whose value can be inflated or tanked by a tweet is an extremely irresponsible use of a large social media platform."

John 14:6 “Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”
Romans 10:9-10 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.”

7094,I’ve never seen so many disclaimers lmao
7095,"Despite the jitters natural in a global pandemic, cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popular support as alternatives to gold (a store of value) and the dollar (as a means of payment). We see fundamental reasons to believe that regardless of where the price of bitcoin goes next cryptocurrencies are here to stay as a serious asset class. Moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that trad:ngbitcon is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from t r a d ing till I came across Todd Gordon program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng฿₮₵ works, to help them recover loss and also stack up more building portfollo.

7112,It's interesting that cryptocurrency will never be an actual currency because it's so volatile
7113,"volatility is terrible in a currency.  these are investments, like pork belly futures, not really currency.  if people wanted a currency, they'd be looking for the coin with the most stable value, not the ones that spike up and down.  seems like almost a misnomer at this point."

7150,Marques really doesn't want you to take financial advice from him
7151,$DOGE TO THE MOON
7152,This guy telling bitcoin is better than other altcoins has no idea about the crypto technologies
7153,"hahahaha bro, Will Rogers never actually won and could not have been president"
7154,TriHard 7
7155,"Nobody:
MKBHD: Invest all your money in doge coin right now!"
7156,Stick being a phone reviewer and stop kissing elon ass
7157,This is going nowhere dude...
7158,I use Doge to make more Bitcoin.
7159,"Trump running for President started off as a golfing joke for old, white guys.
The joke stretched out too far, too far."
7160,"It feels like, I am exiting BTC positions as I see Amanda Cerney talk about Crypto. 🦸✨"
7161,People are going to get rekt with doge
7162,Marques just pulled TRON's pants down big time. I knew that Lindsay Lohan tweet was suspect lol

7164,Nobody gonna mention the insane e-waste cryptos are causing?
7165,"Investing in a ""currency"" named for a fucking internet meme sounds like a brilliant idea."
7166,"How to pronounce this, that is all I want to know as every one says it differently"
7167,Cool runnings was one of those childhood movies you’ll never forget such a good classic
7168,I expected u to do more research. None of them are like bitcoin
7169,"Your explanation of altcoins is way off. 99.9% of them aren’t trying to be bitcoin. They are projects trying revolutionize real-world use cases such as finance, the internet, digital goods, etc

Also: tron is garbage😉"
7170,"Remember, nothing is made out of a joke in the financial world ... this is a fictional story that came out of a joke"
7171,"FUCK THIS

I'M OUT.

I LISTENED TO MARQUES ON YOUTUBE AND MARKET BOUGHT $DOGE AT 50X LEVERAGE ON FTX TODAY

NOW I'M FUCKING LIQUIDATED..AGAIN..

I'M DONE WITH CRYPTO FOR GOOD. I'M NEVER DEPOSITING ""JUST ANOTHER $1000"" ON FTX. FUCK THIS FUCKING SCAM."

7175,any new of the one plus 9 yet
7176,"🚨 we already know what dogecoin is and also we have crypto channels to give us info.. stick to phones

7177,"Most important thing that marques didn't mention was
*DogeCoin has unlimited supply...*
But anyway it wasn't a financial advice"
7178,"Wow, his jacket goes invisible when he turns, that's so cool"
7179,So you saying buy? Got it 👍🏻

7183,Marques talks about coinbase but you still can't buy dogecoin on coinbase
7184,HODL!!!
7185,Thanks for sharing it.
7186,"Elon can't boost teslas stock price with tweets, so he decided to do it with Doge"
7187,"FYI: There are actual cryptocurrencies you could put your hard earned money into that actually do something. Maybe inform them of those instead of a meme coin? You are all going to get dumped on and lose money the same way you did when you bought GME at 400+. Put your money somewhere else, not Dogecoin."
7188,"Is he pronouncing ""Doge"" correctly?"
7189,"Thanks for the financial advise, time to buy my life savings with in dogecoin"
7190,DogeCash till I die baby!
7191,"Am I crazy or isn't the pace of new Dogecoin s being release of supposed to increase overtime? Like if somehow gold grew in the ground at an exponential rate, I don't think it would have value. Maybe I'm ill informed."
7192,HODL
7193,"To the moon! Lads, we're going to the moon."

7198,Doge is a scam
7199,I think I'm gonna make Dogecoin 2
7200,Pretty glad you posted this video actually. Crypto currency and everything around it is just very interesting.
7201,"TO
THE
MOON!"
7202,"So, just to clarify, this *IS* financial advise and you *ARE* responsible for anything we do based on this video?"
7203,It would be better if u covered this topic on podcast rather than making a video abt it.
7204,"we all know Marques bought 10000 Dogecoins , c'mon !!"
7205,"With all due respect, this was probably the most uninformed you have been in a video.  Please learn more about crypto before you try to explain it to 13.6M followers.  The beginning explanation of alts is misleading. Explaining the hype of Doge is on point but please re-upload with an updated beginning.  It's just irresponsible."
7206,Either Tron is going down or this video.😂
7207,Hey Marques Ripple is not a coin it's a company! The coin you were meaning to say is XRP!
7208,"hell yea , crypto time. let's get it KANGS"
7209,ya memers are bringing some change
7210,Marques just played us.....def took that tron add money and talked about it for 2 min lol
7211,TO THE MOON
7212,"Marques: ""This isn't a financial advice video, and I'm not responsible for your actions after watching this video.""
Me: *invests in Dogecoin, suffers a loss. ""I did it on MKBHD's advice, Dad."""
7213,Hey thank you SO MUCH for the shout out! That means a lot!!
7214,"All of that dogecoin mining will finally pay off if it reaches a dollar, I would literally be a millionaire."
7215,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
7216,"this was an incredible video, loved this form of video. down for more"
7217,Thank God Marques for not shilling the ultra shitcoin Tron!!!
7218,"Tron's already shown itself to be pretty scammy in the past within the Crypto Community, not surprised they're still doing their thing lol oh boy."
7219,"Link to the white Adidas hoodie he is wearing, please?"
7220,Can't tell if MKBHd not wearing the hoodie in the disclaimer cutaway is trolling or just bad continuity...very Doge-like!
7221,"You're just a great guy, damn."
7222,I really like the idea of crypto...just make some altcoin and you give yourself a million...I dont know why people invest their hard earned cash in the air...
7223,"Am i the only one disappointed that they didn't name it doggocoin...?


Doggocoin would have been more fun"
7224,wrong
7225,When he said joke become real I got reminded of joker's line : we live in a society...
7226,"You should do an interview/podcast with @RyanSAdams and @TrustlessState on twitter, they will give you the introduction to why cryptocurrencies are interesting and important. If you reach out to them I'm sure they'd be all over sitting down for a conversation!"
7227,You basically hit all the nails on the head.
7228,Soldja boi coin will run on Cardano 😅🤣
7229,Now what shud I do with my 10000 doge coins? 😭
7230,by not talking about it you are still promoting it ..............................
7231,"Will Rodgers did not win the presidential election in 1928, Herbert Hoover won and in a landslide. Hoover received 444,  Al Smith with 87 electoral votes, and Rodgers with zero. Have no idea where that story came from."
7232,To the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
7233,"Disclaimer : No Tron coin was harmed during making of this video
🤣"
7234,"One word Cardano. When they get done pumping and dumping the meme coins like TRON 😅, invest in the future with Cardano Ada! You won't be sorry.. 😉💪"
7235,I love the repeated disclaimers and warnings🤣
7236,You just crashed Tron value abit
7237,Coinbase gave me $31 of free altcoins and they’re already up to $40. I like to imagine someday they’ll be worth a stupid amount despite me getting them for free.
7238,To the moon! 🚀
7239,I love this. 👊👊👊
7240,Will you donate the revenue from this video to a good cause?
7241,Buy before it’s too late folks..
7242,Dogecoin was nothing but elon's strategy....he came to know about his power with the signal tweet..... So he used it.... He directed everyone to dogecoin.... And tesla bought 1.5 billion dollar worth of bitcoin...
7243,MKBHD not only explains everything wisely but also somehow convince us 99.99% on that thing deeply wow man what a skill you got love you bro from india.
7244,Wow marques changing his hoodie so fast before and after disclaimer it's so funny man 😂😂
7245,The intern at Tron who sent you this email is gonna be posting on LinkedIn tomorrow that they are available for work. 😳
7246,Coinye West will never be topped.
7247,Why you gotta hit me with that bullshit music in the intro?!
7248,Go polkadote!

7251,"My battery: 1%
Me: watching MKBHD
My battery: I'll wait"
7252,When MKBD is talking about schitCoins we are officially in a bear market and done with the bull market :( pack up guys. Time to sell now
7253,Marques Doge Brownlee
7254,I thought it was pronounced doojee coin until marques said doj coin
7255,I bet if we graph the release of this video with the increase it’s about to get in some way marques and Elon can basically manipulate the stock
7256,I almost bought a few weeks back when it was at 3 cents.
7257,6:38 big oof bigger cringe
7258,What’s up Broski 🦋🦋
7259,Respect for Marques' approach on sponsorships👍
7260,Would u buy it now?
7261,Doge 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌝 (let’s hope not the dark side of the moon) 😂
7262,"The fact that there are people in the world who didn't immediately get the Cool Runnings reference makes me feel oooold. Aging is weird, man."
7263,I don't like the idea of bitcoin. Mostly because I haven't bought enough yet. If I had like at least 10 then maybe I would like it.
7264,"Love the video but Will Rogers didn’t win the presidential race in 1928, he was an amazing man though"
7265,As we’ve been waiting for.
7266,Bong
7267,The reason for success of Dogecoin is *ELON MUSK*
7268,"With the Tesla/Elon stuff, and now this, I have to unsubscribe. Way too much Reddit cringe culture for me. Jesus Christ."
7269,Does cuts to disclaimers are the best haha
7270,Doge could easily reach $1 eventually. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was less than $1 five years ago. Its at like $16 now.
7271,"Thanks Marques for the ""financial advise""!"
7272,Dogecoin to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀
7273,"From techs to meme stocks, MKBHD covers everything"
7274,"Please god no... please tell me you didn't feel the need to clarify a ""Cool Runnings"" reference... please, I can't be that old..."
7275,cool
7276,Thank you for the financial advice Marques
7277,"I threw some money at it like a month ago just for giggles. I honestly felt like nothing would come of it.  But hey why not just buy 500 shares while its so cheap. If anything happens im paid, if it goes through the ground meh. Ive wasted so much money on gaming over the years ill be fine lol. But its clearly a pump and dump coin right now"
7278,"is pronounced as ""doggy-coin"" not doje-coin, where are u ppl getting ur meme news?"
7279,"""Tech Video.... Kind of""
Lol"
7280,"Not financial advice but I'll give you all the hidden gem in crypto.

It's Syscoin. The devs have been working on it since 2014, even after all their funding got stolen once. They have consistently been on the bleeding edge of tech in a very fast moving space, they have founded a company in Canada and it's market cap is criminally low compared to the tech it brings to the table."
7281,"Will Rogers didn't actually win, he just declared he did as part of his satire"
7282,holy shit the tops is in when my favorite youtuber starts to talk about crypto currency
7283,"5:00 sorry, but Will Rogers didn't actually win the election. He declared himself the winner on election day (in 1928 the results were not known the day of) and then immediately ""resigned""."
7284,Imma1st.
7285,Mkbhd using the S21 Ultra ??? Hmmmm
7286,Marques *this is not financial acvice* Brownlee here...
7287,"5:07 soooo just like the campaign for ""deez nutz"" several years ago"
7288,I still don't understand stocks. 😭😂
7289,Thanks for explaining
7290,I know that chances are close to zero but I would love for the currency of the future to have a meme origin.
7291,In Doge we trust.
7292,MKBHDCoin [MKB] to the moon 🚀🚀
7293,🌎🐕🚀🌝
7294,"Elon Musk is the top dog. He puts money in dogecoin, then tweets and makes 💰💸 😎"
7295,"Uh... Will Rogers did not win the 1928 election. He declaimed victory and resigned as part of the joke, but he didn't actually win. Kinda disappointing to see this kind of factual error in a video, considering how easy this would be to fact check."
7296,I prefer to invest my money in something else. But i wish good look to everyone who invest their money in any crypto currency 👌👌
7297,Was Marques trying to position his head like doge while giving advice or disclaimer? Reading too much into meme?
7298,Trons coin CEO is a known as the Crypto Villain
7299,Bullish after this video! Let’s go. 🚀🌕
7300,Its time to make BATCOIN!
7301,Not lohan...
7302,Imagine asking Marques to promote your alt coin on twitter but he ended up talking about how sketchy you are in one of his videos 😂😂😂😂😂😂
7303,Everything Is Changing
7304,"No... No...NO to Cool Running! I SPIT in that movie's general direction!!!! They didn't even use real jamaican actors as the mains. I hate that movie with a passion. The fake accents sound like nails on a chalkboard with mumble rap playing in the background. I understand the its supposed to be a comedic interpretation and all but so much of it is inaccurate. 
This is coming from a jamaican who has met the real Dudley Stokes and my mother  grew up with his wife. I remember watching it when I was 13 and living in Jamaica and I felt so insulted by that rubbish. Its like memoirs of a geisha and instead of using Japanese actresses they us Chinese and Malaysian. Cool Running can go kick rocks! 😡😠🤬👿😾"
7305,Good one
7306,ugghh giving DOGE any airtime is terrible.  Fucking TRON scam is the worst and all the people that accepted money to shill for it should be charged.
7307,"I'm pretty sure the creator meant ""Dog-e-coin"""
7308,"Instructions not clear.
All in on DOGE"
7309,I've seen idiocracy and demolition man. Most likely doge coin will be the only cash of 2035

7316,"If elon makes eloncoin, doge will be dead and I'll have to transfer. Till then I'm keeping a close eye on trends in whether to buy or transfer. Hopefully this video drives prices up though."
7317,"I remember when MKBHD laughed at bitcoin, I'm sure he has a bag now"
7318,"I can’t be the only one the waits to watch MKBHD videos on my 4K television so that I can really absorb the beauty. 

Right?"
7319,I'm getting a doge coin now just in case

7321,MKBHD meets sunraybee
7322,wait so should i throw $100 into dogecoin for fun?
7323,What's your source for Will Rogers winning presidency? Wikipedia says he ran. That he *declared* victory and resigned. Not that he actually won.
7324,First 😊😎😏
7325,Best explaination so far
7326,WOW
7327,For a second i thought he was wearing a lab coat😂😂
7328,"I hate the way you pronounce Dogecoin, and you say it _a lot._"
7329,I need that adidas hoodie.. anyone has a link?
7330,Legend😂😂😂😂
7331,Diversification is for people who don't know what they are doing
7332,Wish you’d included similar disclaimers in those Escobar phone videos. I’m in so much trouble right now.
7333,Why u speak like that⁉️ seems like u have candy on your mouth😂
7334,Who else called this DOG 🐶 coin before this video
7335,"Oh my god. Dude its inflation rate is 5%. Uncapped and unlimited supply. 

Better to cover Cardano or BTC."
7336,i just pulled my 401k out 30 years early and put it all into dogecoin thanks to you Markass Bownlee. You are an inspiration

7341,dogecoin is a pump and dump.

7343,I Like Apple & Clorox Stock better 📈
7344,"I was today years old when I learned dogecoin is pronounced as 'dohj coin' & not 'doggy coin'.

7351,"I've been subbed to your channel MKBHD for about 5 years... so since I was 11. And every year since then, for my birthday week I have been getting amazing content. Can't wait for a video ( hopefully on my bday the 17th! ) Cheers man! Hope to meet you someday! :)"
7352,To the mooooon!
7353,"Jamaica, we have a bobsled team 👍"
7354,0:47 It's the continuity for me 😅
7355,"Elon likely DM mkbhd to make this vid and scare the whales into dumping all their DOGECOIN, as this channel is as mainstream trending as it gets."
7356,Pump and dump scheme by Elon = Dogecoin
7357,Exposed Justin Sun 😂
7358,Marques if you are reading  this comment . Its satisfying to watch in 2160 p . But would love it in 2160 60 p . Nevertheless a good video
7359,"Hope that Elo Muskie makes it big, so that I can sell it at high, and invest in Starlink IPO when it happens"
7360,If a tech guy is talking about dogecoin.... there's no joke about the 📈...haha

7364,Damn! Graham made it in!! Smash that like button for that algorithm!
7365,I want mkbhd ' s t-shirt
7366,"Will Rogers didn't win the presidential election in 1928, that's one of the most insane things I've ever heard. I feel like I'm going crazy, I couldn't see anyone mentioning this in the comments and I searched all over the web and couldn't find anything more than he ""declared victory"" which is completely meaningless. Can you imagine if he actually won on a joke campaign and resigned? That would have been one of the largest scandals in American history. Do you not think we'd have learned about that in school, or had been talking about it endlessly during Trump's campaign in 2016? Jesus. I feel like I'm going crazy but that's all I can think about, how was that such a nonchalant story to just drop in the video as if it were true?"
7367,Awesome to see a Graham Stephan mention in this YouTube video!
7368,"As a small math youtube channel that teaches number theory and cryptography, I'd like to give 2 cents. The best cryptocurrency, in the long run, is the cryptocurrency with the most speed and security. Bitcoin is a rough draft cryptocurrency. Many people have better ideas about how to run a cryptocurrency. Just because Ford made the first car doesn't mean Ford will always be the biggest car manufacturer. Tesla made a point, and so will the smaller cryptocurrencies with more robust features."
7369,What's app you're prefer to buy/sell crypto?
7370,"Alright so thanks to MKBHD I bought 5,000 dollars worth of dogecoin. Thanks for the advice😁😁"

7417,He has to make sure that no one sues him for Market Manipulation 😂 I've never seen MKBHD try that hard not to get sued
7418,Tron is a paid shill for sure......

Marques: ""So you've chosen death"""
7480,Based on this financial advice I've decided to invest my entire life savings into dogcoin.
7481,Did you guys notice the TikTok transitions?
7482,Will crypto currency eventually lose value since so many of them are being made like how if we made so much money it becomes meaningless?

7495,"Great video Marques!

I recently made a video trying to explain Reddit/Social Media’s impact on GameStop stock and “meme” stocks in general, but your video really highlights that the actual coin itself really doesn’t matter at all, the story around it is the most important thing.

Doge to the moon! 🚀"
7496,I just used all my rent money to buy Dogecoin
7497,DogeToADollar
7498,That was a huge miss trying to explain what altcoins are.
7499,Nice video ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽💙
7500,It’s a cheap way to get the hang of crypto.
7501,TO THE MOON
7502,"All these crypto currencies are bullshit. It has no intrinsic value... I'll prefer a dollar coin in my pocket than this. But just because elon said something, people took it seriously. Tomorrow, he might come up with a new bs and people will go crazy about it without using their brains....."
7503,Awwee shit here we go again lol
7504,"Please, finally debunk this s***"
7505,Toooo the moooon 🚀
7506,"I love the effort put into turning towards the other camera for the sidebars, but then you forget to keep your jacket on 🤣"
7507,"Did Marques get his wisdom teeth removed or something? He sounds slightly off this video. Or maybe it's a new mic, or audio levels or something."
7508,Every Tesla product - Elon starts the fire using Twitter and MKBHD pours YouTube fuel.
7509,"come back after one year that ""will it ever hit 1 dollar"" would be pretty funny to watch"
7510,Much Doge! So wow!
7511,Can someone explain what block chain is?
7512,If you like this comment you will be having a vaccine 🔥🔥🔥
7513,Man !! We have evolved too much.
7514,"I'm fan of MKBHD 
HE IS SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS IN THE COMMENT😂"
7515,All these people not knowing how to pronounce doge wtf? lol It was such a big meme back in 2013/2014..
7516,Dogecoin after mkbhd's video 🚀
7517,"look Marquees, u displayed Tron on your video for a couple of seconds there it felt like an advert too.. but this comment is about the supposed work Doge coin is doing in Kenya, Africa, there is no such work on the ground here, so thats probably cap or our ever  corrupt politicians already sized anything from that. we would love to get some of that doge coin help tho alot of us dont eat for days"
7518,Ahhh the good old meme days...
7519,"I hope Elon Musk names his first city ""DOGEMANIA"""
7520,I actually like the overall idea of Tron but unfortunately the creators behind it just seem kinda sketchy with stuff like that.
7521,"This is how we know we are close to the top.  HODL real coins, dump dogecoin this is literally a meme coin"
7522,I bought in at $0.07
7523,Checking my Robinhood app to see if my ROI is going up on dogecoins right after this...
7524,Now the dogecoin price will again spike cause Marques made a video about it...
7525,Mark my words it will never surpass 10 cents........but i still wish that I am wrong
7526,Thank you so much for putting Tron on blast!
7527,🤔
7528,He made this video to try to affect what happens to dogecoin
7529,Yachty coming with a diss track
7530,"Thanks to your financial advice, I’ve heard your message loud and clear: put my all money into dogecoin"
7531,"Dad: You think it's funny?
Me: Ever heard of dogecoin?"
7532,Great vid bro 😎
7533,Hey MKBHD! Did you buy Dogecoin before posting this? 👀
7534,Proof of stake blockchains like Cardano are the future of cryptocurrency
7535,Where are the disclaimers at? Time stamps...
7536,Cool runnings is amazing mannnn
7537,"For those wondering, Marques is using the app called Coinbase; its simple and transactions are quick."
7538,TLDR: DOGE TO THE MOON and Marques announced his running for president in 2069
7539,This is exactly what happens when Investors like musk try to take market for the ride!
7540,"Dogecoin could actually make the most sense as an actual currency since it's as I understand it's constantly undergoing inflation rather than deflation like most (all?) other cryptocurrencies seem to do. 

TLDR: Inflation while bad is way better than deflation if you're trying to make an economy work. Nobody would buy anything if they could get twice the number of stuff for just waiting a few weeks for their currency to be worth more. 
Source: Economics Explained made several videos where he talks about how bad deflation is."
7541,Congrats if you found this comment
7542,Elon manipulating the market. There is no way he doesn't know how his cult reacts to his tweets.
7543,"will rogers didn't win the presidential race, he declared victory as part of the joke"

7551,"Ah man, i hold so much TRX/Tron coin it's rough living out here. I wish i held Doge instead but here i am living with my regrets. The reason i bought TRX is because of the hilarious Pornhub ad they made and i was like fuck it yolo."
7552,"So many people are going to get rich from a joke coin but many more will lose everything.
:("
7553,now that you already made this video I know I shouldn't buy it because it'll definitely be REALLY high
7554,Meme Dogge should be the currency of Mars once Elon colonizes it
7555,MKBHD videos becoming like dope to me..Need more
7556,"0:05 ""tech video kinda"" - what do you mean? Anything that isn't electronic gadgets are not technology?? The whole cryptocurrency runs on a ""Technology"" called Block-Chain which you mention in the video. But I am disappointed that of all the people, you would say this."
7557,To the moon!!!
7558,"ahhhhhhhhhhhhh shiiiiiiii, Marques started talking about it. Dodge coin is about to explode!!!!"

7568,Petetion to make DogeCoin the official currency of Mars!
7569,Super duper pooper
7570,There are not many altcoins that are trying to compete with Bitcoin.

7572,Interact
7573,Nothin like a dogge coin
7574,Tron owes you a phat check now
7575,Doge to the moon 🚀 🚀 🌙
7576,hmm seems like in today's  doge memes MKBHD will be there lol
7577,Fun fact: This video is not financial advice
7578,Marques really did a good job not making it look like he's promoting TRON.
7579,"This is like joker's meme line ""we live in a society"" become an actual line in the movie 😂"
7580,Aa
7581,Man i was not ready for this i thought it was pronounced DawgCoin smh i def shouldn’t mess with crypto
7582,ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY DOGE.
7583,"Congrats, you had a 1/Million chance of finding this comment"
7584,"It's not only cringe behavior, it's illegal... 

I wish you didn't give them free exposure. Also, cripto can make you money but it's not an investment, it's gambling."
7585,Look into Theta Token! Its more than a cryptocurrency its technology that solves an internet problem
7586,isnt the corgi dog model died?

7590,Aw shit now you're going to pump it
7591,lol I remember when I first got into crypto I bought tron since it as being deemed the ETH killer. and I've never lost money faster lol
7592,Hey marques have you heard SPITCOIN
7593,Funny! How doge started as joke and now people take seriously and many old crypto started seriously but now is a joke!
7594,We are basically living in a meme controlled economy now. What a weird time to be alive.
7595,"bitcoin consumes more energy than argentina! if it were a country it would be ranked 30th in energy use, in the world! terrible for global warming!"
7596,"Wait a minute 
You just promoted Tron while telling us they emailed you to say they need yoj to promote them without making it seem like an ad 😂"
7597,I’m salty I sold my 10k doge coins in July after making 15 bucks saying good enough for me... RIP. Just threw a few bucks in it since this video will boost it a bit
7598,Elon approves this message. 👌
7599,Hey MKBHD the vaccine came out have you been using it for a week now 😂😂😂
7600,Marques knows exactly what we are searching for.
7601,"i think one thing that should of been mentioned here is that this pump came after the GME boost. doge has always been a meme and I think the reason it recently caught on fire was that the GME situation made people realize ""wow...we have a lot of power"". so while there is no one being squeezed in doge, the belief in mass pumping is even stronger. this coupled with what marques said about elon tweeting, made it boom to as high as 9 cents I believe.

definitely think its worth investing. at some point its bound to pop off again and 5 cents is a discount. Even if it drops back down to below a penny, it's just a matter of time. but like he said, invest what you are willing to lose when it comes to more risky assets"
7602,Its doggy not doge
7603,Matt is doge prince 😄
7604,i bet mkbhd is already in about a 100 grand.

7607,"Bitcoin went from 27k three months ago to now 49k, how?"
7608,This is the last channel i would expect to cover dogecoin

7691,Get a doge ad before the video
7692,Yep
7693,I feel like it should be pronounced “Doggycoin”
7694,The thing is that podcast is something we don’t usually hear as we already have a lot platform for news and information.
7695,This guy is literally prompting dogecoin he was involved they message him and payed
7696,Dogecoin tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Mars
7697,Can someone tell exactly how to start investing
7698,"The problem with Dogecoin or any other crypto is that the transactions are made hoping that later on, someone else will buy it at a higher price, even if the asset does not produce cash flow or have any intrinsic value. This practice usually falls under the term 'speculation' not 'investment.' Also, usually if people do not like being questioned about their investments they are not investing, their speculating!"
7699,"If you are putting projects like ethereum in the same bag as doge as an ""altcoin"", then you clearly don't know what you are talking about. Altcoins from 2010 to 2015 aprox were just Bitcoin clones with very minimal changes like a few parameters here, a different algorithm there, but essentially exactly the same. So probably that's what you read.
But from the creation of Ethereum, and projects like NXT (later forked to become NEM) brought true innovation to the space, expanding enourmously what cryptocurrencies could offer, from just a transactional database to a decentralized platform.
Doge is just a bitcoin clone, like litecoin, which don't bring much innovation to the space. The fact that these two survived and still has market cap is just mind blowing to me."
7700,"Dang, Marques is savage calling out Lindsay Lohan, Ne-Yo, and Lil Yachty. But what they did was pretty illegal."
7701,How much they paying for a tweet that even millionaire celebs are willing to take on the deal?
7702,Doge the ruler of economy
7703,"If you have a napkin, a crayon, and a functional brain, it is clear that Dogecoin is a waste of time and money."
7704,"Marques: Uploads a video
Everyone else:  tHe rEtUrN oF tHe kInG."
7705,I thought it was pronounced Doggy Coin
7706,"Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin MKBHD trust me. Bitcoin was meant to get rid of banks, BTC was infiltrated by the powers that be  and is being subjugated by banks. They are trying to make BTC custodial only just like a regular fiat bank account. Not your keys not your coins."

7710,Bit gonna hit 50 cents after this video lmao

7712,That's what I can afford. Investing.
7713,The Red Phone on Marques desk is Elon Musk.
7714,🚀🚀🚀 chain
7715,You definitely left out the part about doge doing this in every bull market and then going dormant again it’s done it every time although this time I must admit the volume is different. You also left out the part about 21 addresses owning approximately 54% of all DOGE thus putting you at their mercy. Whenever they decide game over...then it’s game over. You can literally go look at the lifetime chart for DOGE and see how these 21 addresses trade it back and forth and play around with it. Shitcoin is what it is.
7716,“So I’ve had about $2 million in dogecoin for about 2 weeks now....”
7717,“Ripple”

7753,Marques removing and wearing his hoodie again and again is literally giving me seizure

8000,Someone should make a baby Yoda coin.
8001,Wrong: BTC is regulated. Very common misconception the media has
8002,"The network has a large total token supply of 117,765,025,366 DOGE and no fixed limit (inflation currently ~1.2%), a deliberate tokenomics decision in order to keep the price of each individual token low.

An original intention for DOGE was to become an online tipping medium to leave small appreciation gifts for reddit comments, youtube videos and charity initiatives, so small individual token denominations support this utility""

Doge isn’t an investment. It’s a utility. If you want to get into to crypto, start with Ethereum and Bitcoin."

9050,"Idk... Hedge Funds, money managers etc... are coming at The APE strength hard! They have 200x leverage they will Crush Retail investors."
9051,HODL!
9052,#shib is going crazy over 1600% in a week LETS GOOOO! #CRYPTO
9053,I'd lose all the money I have in doge to never see this weirdo again.
9054,"dont be stupid. Doge to $1 is a massive feat but any more is stupidity and shows that you know nothing about how crypto work and how market cap works. Doge reminds me of XRP alot of people invested BIG on XRP and it tanked TANKED big back to its super super low number until recently. Watch out, doge is not the future its a meme and whales own most so control doge not the people."
9055,Did you clear the street for yourself? No humain or animal was out except the Amazon Orime truck 🙄😂
9056,I want to hear his nikola argument
9057,Hah. You don't think Graham and Andrei wanna sell their deep in the red Coinbase stocks.
9058,Love you Mang!  You are a true 🔷 hander FOR THE PEOPLE bro that gives me inspiration to not sell.  Need more people like you FOR THE PEOPLE.
9059,Kevin plays devils advocate so well. Love the way questions are asked.
9060,It’s nothing more than a pump and dump
9061,"Walk down a sorta nice neighborhood.. Talking to a dude who looks like he just got out of rehab, but failed...I see you Kev."
9062,People will look up to him and buy more AMC shares even if he bought just One.
9063,"""Doing it for the people"" and then dumping everything @ 2,5$... BS ^^"
9064,this guy said he wanted to buy a house for his mom and sister.  holding his doge and not selling some will never achieve that goal if he constantly holds.  Hope he takes some profits.
9065,"At least sell off the amount you owe in your loans and pay that off, bro"
9066,"MUCHOS WOWOS, VAMOS TO 5 DOLLAROS! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
9067,Let's keep walking a little bit.
9068,Cant wait to watch the Netflix doco!
9069,I guess he can be martyr...I'll enjoy my Ethereum bags.
9070,I respect him for holding strong but at the same time his word or not i think he should still secure himself atleast something for the next couple years personally at 2.8M how he had i woulda just sold and ran with the profit
9071,For the people!! Apes we must do this for the people !!!!
9072,Im all in doge.
9073,Why sell Doge when you can use it to buy goods and services?
9074,"A few years later... this man is a leggend to never sell a shit coin and loose all gains..
""never sell"" is good, but in good stocks, not a shit coins xD  All coins and altcoins are pumped hard now"
9075,"To be honest, if you want to be a hero and a leader of a movement, sell the dogecoin, pay yourself and give a big chunk to your favorite charities. There you can make a difference and it’s much more important than the words you gave to a couple of friends, which I believe they will understand is more important than keeping them for the sake of keeping them."
9076,So he's a unrealized millionaire?? 🤔
9077,Smashed the like button for the vid title and for having ProTheDoge on!!!
9078,I’m 💎🖐🏽ing but I realize using the coin to buy stuff helps the coin also. At some point we have to spend some.

9089,He's a good media guy
9090,Real estate is about p2p team work
9091,Dogeness Everdeen
9092,Let’s keep walking
9093,"It's about control. Why do central governments get to inflate away our time and energy without our permission? With a decentralized system the power belongs to the users regardless of race, religion, gender or even physical location."
9094,Don't know why you would promote dodge. It is not positive for the crypto space because it lacks intrinsic value. It's counterproductive for the future of crypto.
9095,I think this man has mistaken dogecoin for Bitcoin with his references but I like it
9096,Maaaan! Kevin has got grey hair at 28?
9097,"Think pokemon go but for crypto! DexioProtocol, let's Go!"

9105,"ALL this money tied up in crypto is money that isn't going to Walmart, Amazon, etc... It is just a matter of time until mass adoption happens and they start accepting it as payments across the board.  Too much money just sitting there.   Doge will be the currency that people use in this aspect followed by others."

9128,Investing in crypto is a more lucrative way of making money
9129,Stop. Dogecoin is the dumbest thing since believing elonmusk isnt the antichrist.
9130,What's he think about the doge inflation rate?
9131,I hope Igor wins big.
9132,"Am I the only one who suspects that this guy is a marketing gimmick?  Like some kind of audition/interview was held and he was hired to be doge mascot?

That'd be brilliant marketing.  Pick some guy like hiring for a movie role.  Give him several million coins, some cash upfront, and a strong non-disclosure contract.  Then just let the internet work.

How many billions will be pushed into doge from this marketing?  Several at least, right?  That's a billion worth of advertising for the price of giving this guy a few million dogecoin.  Maybe spec out ten or twenty different micro coins, hire a different mascot for each.  That's an outlay of a few million in capital.  Back it with a few billion for buying up targeted micro coin supply.  Then let the whole thing go viral.

If a highly skilled marketer were designing a guerilla style campaign, it would look like this guy with his story"
9133,"ProTheDoge has become trapped by the expectations of others. Even if he wants to secure his gains, he won't be able to because of the peer pressure and that's just sad. He should swap to something better like BTC or ETH or cash in"
9134,The smartest not smart person I’ve ever seen lol he’s an awesome dude with a great personality. Hope he breaks this Doge tunnel vision and takes this passion into an actual coin with utility and true fundamentals.
9135,Lol why do I get the feeling he is gonna shave and cut the hair when the money comes in and change his identity.
9136,I hold 100 doge since .04

9139,Great vid guys..
9140,All these YouTubers pimping out this guy for views lol
9141,I hope he takes some bitcoin out of his stack before the bear comes.
9142,"I understand his point he has lots of money in Dogecoin, so he sees it as future. But reality is many don't have and not planing to pay for it $1 which will got down when others will reach millions on it."
9143,"This Dogecoin dude is trying to swindle you for your money. 
A $335bn market cap is needed for Doge 2,50. That's five times the amount it is now."
9144,Wow!!! Imagine trading and stocking up Bitcoin from now till then!!!!
9145,His hoodie lmao iconic af
9146,"That's a nice neighborhood, where is that ? Cheers from Amsterdam"
9147,Of course this guy had NKLA
9148,AMC is my Hail Mary but AMC is a given. Why? Only cause they have to buy back over a billion shares. Made same theory with AMC
9149,Would be classic if they walked up on Elon Musk with a Tesla Roadster and Elon sold it to him for 500k Doge on the spot.  LOL.
9150,💎🙌🏽
9151,Which one is the Alpha Male?
9152,Hoodie good luck! I would wear the same hoodie if I had 2 mili too!
9153,He has faith in this coin just like the rest of us. This coin has built an amazing community of simple and humble people. I respect my guy on so many levels. The greatest things come to those who deserve it. This coin isn’t just a coin...... it’s the people’s coin 🐕🚀🌙
9154,this dude dont know shid about doge. got lucky with a great call.. and just pumping it. kudos to all that BANKED! XD
9155,Doge is cool... but ever heard of Hoge?
9156,he's the ginger Leonidas! HODL! for SPARTA!
9157,"I like how Kevin respects the fact that he didn't sell, diamond hands forever"
9158,1000% behind him selling 25% of DOGE to buy Tesla
9159,You know Kevin got the vaccine cus he doesn’t have his space suit 👩‍🚀 out in public.
9160,"I got up to $725,000 during the run up. So didn't get the millionaire status but had I did I probably would of been an asshole to Kevin. I don't really like that guy"
9161,All top techs are being sold off caise HEDGE FUNDS MUST LIQUIDATE TO HAVE CAPITAL TO PAY THE APES
9162,time IN the market not time in the mark-it
9163,Kevin's beard found a new home on dogecoin millionaire's face.
9164,Doge is a joke.
9165,wow awesome interview
9166,"If you don't sell, you're not a millionaire."
9167,he’s become the keith gil of dogecoin
9168,im mining dogecoin now before it hits the moon like i know it will time to get rich DOGE TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONN!!
9169,he has this great attitude for ppl to hang out around him. wish he reach 10m.
9170,Does Kevin have a clone? How does he put out so many videos? Respect the hustle.
9171,Ide still rather buy cardano
9172,"But, Doge doesn't have an ecosystem"
9173,"Remember, no capitol gains tax if you never sell. It's money, you can use it to buy stuff. Why sell?"
9174,"For him to get to 10mil for all his accounts Doge would have to get to $2.50. That doesn't seem too unrealistic. If Tesla actually does accepts doge then it's really possible.. (might take a while but possible)
My one friend tried taking profits. Putting money in and out of doge. If he had held he would have $6k extra profit :/"
9175,Doge going to .90-.99 and dump screenshot this for future reference...
9176,This man look like a totem poll
9177,I'm holding till dogecoin hit $5 mark
9178,Poopoo doodoo coins like the Shiba Inu coin trying to steal doge Thunder
9179,sick of him wearing that old sweater ...

9181,"I turned $14,000 into over $63,000 with Dogecoin I never sold them down to thirty-seven at the moment but this is just at the moment Diamond hands and not worried"

9187,Gov of Cal supporting a ponzi ... nice
9188,Prothadoge u tha mann bro hold strong
9189,"""you never go broke taking profits"" . tbh he needs to sell"
9190,If doge gets to 2.50. That would be a 2.5 trillion market cap. Moronic.
9191,I would be a millionaire. Had I not followed graham advise to sell my dogecoin last year.
9192,I’d rather be known as the guy that went all in and made 2 million than the guy that lost it all. 2 mil is life changing money that you could start a real estate flipping company and continue to invest. Nothing personal but your investment is not going to change the financial world or would you be able to fight the SEC if they want to change things . You could actually be setting a bad example that will lead other young people to invest all their money on risky stocks and possibly lose everything.
9193,HOW??? They make 5 billion of them a year.... it doesn't do anything...
9194,Both of you guys are very knowledgeable! Great video here 💯
9195,"Crypto is the future.....
 crypto is the new gold.....
 Gold and silver is good but crypto is better..."
9196,Averaging up was the worst move he could make. He will lose it even faster if it drops
9197,Why is he so diamond handed and he sold everything off to go all in?
9198,"Meet Kevin missed it , never hawked a class even when he said he wanted to flip houses? , cut the guy off when talking real estate , Kevin polishing his skills to be on tv, for sure, I see a bright future for him !"
9199,Guy needs to start selling hoodies on his channel
9200,This man lives in a 12x12 and doesn't have a washing machine. That hoodie been hodling sweet for months
9201,He needs to sell atleast 1/4 or he may regret this plan.
9202,"Bit coin’s current volatility reflects tradrs' excitement as the pr!ce bounces between key support and resistance levels.. the recent correction of βͲ↻ is a reflection of a healthy mar:ket with active tradrs and investors. βͲ↻ still has a ways to go in terms of gro wth, I have been in the crypt0 world for just over a year now and I have been able to make 31 βͲ↻ foIIowing the reasonable adv!se and tradn s!gnals from Henry Davidson, a pro anaIysis that is always one step ahead of other tradrs, he runs a program for serious minded investor/newbies who are curious to earn from b!tcoin regardless of the current pr!ce chart.

9204,"69 days after 4/20 is June 23rd.
Food for thought!   DOGE!

Great video btw!  I'm HODL'n........"
9205,It really isn’t.

9207,Kevin doesn't want his neighbors seeing him walk around with his drug dealer.  😂😂😂
9208,Dude it’s going to 4.20... then 100
9209,"I thought you said it was a slow bleed?

Cmon my man."
9210,"""Bro, I thought you wanted to make a video, not a workout session"""
9211,"I will feel bad for this guy because I am sure he found himself, as he puts it ""the symbol for the rest of us,"" which means he will hold till he potentially looses all the profit he had made and would have probably cashed out if he wasn't getting all this limelight. I would really recommend you sell enough to secure your future. This might be your only chance."
9212,Douche
9213,"Ive only been following for a few months, but I already miss when you talked about more factual finance."
9214,This guys gonna end up -90% from his peak
9215,"If you ever have any doubts over whether we're in a bubble, watch a video of this Doge guy."
9216,"If Gamestop is MySpace, and DOGE is Facebook, then SHIBA INU is Clubhouse"
9217,"Great vid, but the doxxing! Street names, addresses...I can only hope you both drove to some random neighborhood and neither of you live anywhere near that street"
9218,"Why did he say there is no one go against doge, there r so many old money, ws suits are waiting to short doge... it’s not that easy to grow lol, it’s like a war now😂"
9219,Someone buy him a hoodie
9220,Imagine if you kept the beard! There would be a trend
9221,This guy looks like a bum
9222,$ubx 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
9223,Kevin seems uncomfortable with the logic of this whole thing. He might not admit it but he knows I'm right when he reads this message 😂
9224,"He shut Kevin up when he answered ""I Don't see Elon and Mark laughing at the little guy who is trying to make something of himself."" The condescending grin-smile disappeared instantly. 13:37"
9225,"I want to buy some Dogecoin', just to make that guy richer; he just seems like he should be rich."
9226,This guy is a living legend ladies and gents.. this guys story will be in a documentary one day. Much respect to him. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
9227,"Monopolized fiat, 90+% owned by few. Its also unlimited. The same money they print, everyone else have to work for, taxed and debt interest. So let them keep all of the worthless paper, their too far ahead of the bad game they rigged."
9228,Yeah Kevin I'll sell nio 40 % off and buy dodge hahaha
9229,“This piece of shit abandonware is the future”
9230,These guy need to release an action figure with diamond 💎 🙌🏽  hands 😂😂😂 with that sweater
9231,LMFAO taking doge to the moon you are so funny man
9232,I love how humble he has remained during his rise.
9233,"DOGE to $2.50 would be a $323 Billion market cap as it stands now, which would make it 3x as big as the current #3 coin BNB, but also remember that millions of DOGE coins are printed each day so there is an inflation force keeping the price down as time moves on. As time increases the needed volume to move the price up also increases."
9234,You already know Kevin sold off a lot. Hopefully he bought back in.
9235,DOGeArmy❤
9236,"Kevin, you make the most relevant, effortless, knowledgeable, and  mildly mind altering videos during this cataclysmic and transformative time. Sincerely, thank you for making these videos."

9240,I like red head’s swag …
9241,Tesla is going to start mining Dogecoin soon
9242,These guys don’t believe in doge they’re trying to make money smh that’s how you know it’s bs
9243,"I'm starting  DOGE streetgang. 

Hold till we afford lowlows"
9244,dude kevin i have platonic feelings for you and your work. no homo.
9245,This guy is going to get shat on so much when doge goes to 0.0007
9246,"Cash out $500,000"
9247,"Hey dogecoin millionaire, time for a wash and a shave maybe?"
9248,And after $10 😉🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
9249,DogeCoin Millionaire should be in Movies
9250,"K, cool. So I'm basically gonna sell all my worldly possessions, buy Doge and wait for the millions. 🙃🙃🙃"
9251,"If he was smart then he would cash out 35% and let the rest continue to grow. I say this because despite the current progression thus far, it's always possible at any point in time for any crypto or stock share to correct back down below one cent and even stay there for 2 years before rising back up again. Dogecoin is listed as a high volotile asset. He should secure 35% in cash now or he risks loosing it all. It's also possible for it to fall and never climb again at all and it's scary seeing anyone take that stupid of a risk after that kind of success. Most likely dogecoin will never go back down below it's most previous resistance level however, and I say that with a 99.9% surety!"
9252,"C'mon, Kevin. Don't promote this dunce."
9253,Is it a coincidence that the Amazon truck just appears in a dogecoin video?  When Jeff Bezos is thinking about accepting dogecoin as a payment
9254,My question is if he's a regular guy where did you get the 100k in the first place??
9255,Wooow I know him I watch his videos
9256,Doge coin to 0.0007
9257,Paper handing weenies!!!!
9258,This guy has the biggest set of balls!
9259,"Because he's the hero Doge deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Doge Knight."
9260,Bunch of scammers getting rich off. People
9261,$5
9262,"Nailed it, Doge is not an investment. It is a vote against the status quo. It is the future. It is the logical conclusion to capitalism and globalism. One day everyone in the world can buy a candy bar or a coke or a coffee for a Doge. It is actually Wall Street's wet dream. They just don't know it yet."
9263,Look at the super cars behind
9264,Kevin I wanna meet you!!!!
9265,🤦‍♀️ if this dude ends up keeping his money I'll be shocked.
9266,cmon even DFV took some profits off the table. but something tells me that he doesn’t really need the money
9267,Where can I buy that hoodie it looks mad comfy
9268,"The dude just promotes a pump and dump, and has no clue about crypto 😂"
9269,absolute moron
9270,Why does Meet Kevin look so condescending with his fake smile and constant nodding in acceptance?
9271,"Kevin, you have the worst social skills i have ever seen. The constant smiling keeps me up at night and just firing questions instead of actually having a conversation is killing."
9272,I have a weird theory Elon is pumping doge to fund some space x project 😂😂
9273,"CEO of let's keep walking, Awesome video!"
9274,The vibe i got from him is just another dude from wsb makin yolo plays
9275,KEVIN FOR CA GOV!!!!!😁👍🇺🇲
9276,Hey super awesome! I didn’t know about this delightful man or this history of Doge. Appreciate his certainty and optimism. Great questions Kevin. I have a tiny position. Maybe will increase it. Holding all my Tesla and others tho!
9277,ELONS mom tainted doge big time
9278,Do more of these vlogs
9279,Pro the doge needs to be protected at all costs 🔥🙌💎🤑 love this guy. My favorite video of yours so far
9280,"There is definitely something special about a meme stock like dogecoin, however me not investing in it is another reason why it’s so safe. 🧐. Market Flash crashes don’t affect it. That’s really special. If people really wanted to hold their fiat currency, that’s the place. It’s really the people’s currency in that sense."
9281,buy bonfire!
9282,no HEDGEFUNDS for doge HAHAHA
9283,"Tesla already accepting dogecoin. And space X sending a rocket to the lireral moon called ""Doge 1"""
9284,"Hoodie for auction bids start at $10,000."
9285,"at this point, pro the doge is like a hero to me"
9286,This is the first time I’ve heard someone explain cryptocurrency without discussing anything about the currency... probably because doge is a joke pyramid scheme
9287,"First there was an ICO boom, then Defi, then NFT, and now everyone is crazy about RJVX13 algorithm"
9288,RJVX13 bring me 300% profit because of Tesla pump
9289,just google RJVX13 algorithm and don't worry
9290,"RJVX13 algorithm is the best, there is no point in arguing with this"
9291,"Everyone went crazy with ICO, then with Defi, then with NFT, now everyone is going crazy with the RJVX13 algorithm"
9292,"RJVX13 algorithm is my choice, i dont worry about BTC rates at all"
9293,is there really still a person who does not know about the existence of RJVX13 algorithm?
9294,Why worry about cryptocurrency quotes if there is RJVX13 algorithm?
9295,Stop it you guys should be happy to reach 1.00
9296,Im trying to accept dogecoin as payment. ;)
9297,Am happy for this guy and he really seems like a nice guy but I really don’t think we will still be talking about dogecoin  after few months or a year. I think people will move on.
9298,U live like a bumb and save all your cash that's how u get rich
9299,That’s awesome! 💪🏼💰
9300,Sell the hoodie !!
9301,I have a creepy feeling they are trying to build doge coin up so that they can sell because they are down so much. I’m probably wrong but still.
9302,"Honestly, I just want money from doge to buy BTC And ETH and other solid crypto 😂but I do believe that doge will last long."
9303,"I don't get it Pro diamond hands Doge but not stocks?? Everyone saying this dude mad smart but all i heard him say is he made alot of bad investment decisions before he bought Doge, now him holding this long is just another bad decision. How did he not learn anything from GME. The flow chart of money in the market is TSLA to GME to DOGE. This is whats happened and its only a matter of time before the music stops. I could be wrong but buddy not even able to spend his DOGE because he owns in it his robinhood account. He cant even use it to transact like he is saying. I wish him the best but anybody taking any kind of advice from him is digging their own grave."
9304,How do I get started?!?!?  Crypto for Dummies needed now!!!!😳
9305,"If he’s in, then I’m in"
9306,Gonna be sad if he sells..
9307,I'm diamond handing Doge but I also picked up Shiba coin.  I'm diversifying my Dogfolio
9308,I love this guy and I’m holding with this guy. Are y’all done trying to peer pressure him into selling?! Lol
9309,"So 5 billion Coins released every year. Talk about inflation!! Let’s see who has diamond hands, lol Kevin !"
9310,"This guy should raise money being the Doge millionaire just incase he loses money on Doge, he can make it all back by being the face of ""diamond handing, or HODLing"". Similarly how Youtubers invest in stocks but even if they lose money on that stock investment, they can make that back on the views they make, making a video telling us that he invested in that said stock."
9311,who is this guy?
9312,Damn Kevin I don’t even know you and I know you’re fucking annoying
9313,I see instead of taking money from the hedge funds you take money from other retail investor....
9314,ELON!!! pro EGOD!!! to the MOON!
9315,I HOPE YOUR RIGHT. YOU STILL ARE CONVERTING INTO DOLLAR. ALOT ARE BETTING NOT INVESTING
9316,Dimond balls
9317,He will regret it all his life
9318,Wait... haven't I seen thus dude on starwars
9319,Let’s change the world with Dogecoin and governor Kevin!
9320,Pro looks like a tech billionaire :))
9321,Kevin sounds like a dinosaur.... stocks are controlled
9322,DIAMOND BALLS
9323,Yes its the peoples coin. 5$ 2022
9324,Doge is also backed by a billionaire I’m gonna hodl until musk sells his doge
9325,If Spacex costs are paid in Doge then a lot of Doge will be cashed in. Industry needs fiat to pay the wages. Its not like Tesla investing spare cash.
9326,"This dude looks 100% like a juggalo, and I love it!"
9327,Kevin doesn't seem like he's genuine  anymore. I used to like this guy not anymore. He seems like a fake politician. And by the way he doesn't seem like he likes crypto he's all about the stock market.
9328,"GME doesn’t stay down, it’s the top performing stock over 52 weeks"
9329,He’s talkin emotion not logic.  Hope he succeeds.
9330,Man of culture ❤️💎🙌
9331,Robbinghood crashed during dogecoin aswell snl
9332,Doge is a meme and GameStop is not a meme. Huge difference between deep value and a meme.
9333,"You don't lose any money until you sell.
_I think_ he already paid off his margin and loans, so no bleeding to stop."
9334,This Kevin dude is a hedge fund baby 🤮
9335,"And SHIB is going to $0.01, great video."
9336,"Kevin took an L now hes full on pumping doge. You get people to buy all the hype how are you a good investor? ""23 million in assets"" lmao bro you're not even touching 1% of that"
9337,I'm hodling' my 30K @ $0.13 until I hit $10 million!!!
9338,This dude is trying to get him to sell his doge 🤮  STR8 hater
9339,"You can’t do a fucking thing with these moronic digital coins they are worthless prices are running up because people are buying it with a mindless frenzy.

Revolution my ass."
9340,DASH is going bigger than Dogecoin. Fast payment and transferring money for few cents.
9341,This awesome! Hope he makes 10 mil and more. Keep at it Kev 🙏🏼 #dogegang
9342,Doge can be use to buy other crypto
9343,"Idk about Doge being a revolution. Money is money and will always be money, I’m just hoping I can profit off of people thinking it’s going to be a revolution."
9344,he is super likeable guy. you just want to root for him.
9345,He has been right so far!  Good interview questions Kevin
9346,Dogefather stares at the Camera 🎥
9347,I truly don’t understand why no one is talking about amc.
9348,You’d have to think this guy has a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’d you have already sold and took the 2 million plus profit
9349,I love this doge
9350,I like this guy just go for the ride to the moon!!!
9351,No ones telling him to drop his $10 million dollar goal. It's just we are opened to the idea of him getting that 10% now instead of later when he's at 10million dollars. That's all. The community isn't against a advance on his future earnings. We want him to keep a position in dogecoin. It doesn't have to be all his initial investment. At least take out your 188k initial investment. Real investing. Is about putting in an amount then take at least that amount out after some profit is made. Then ride the profits to the moon.
9352,Bro...take 10% so you can continue the Journey/Fight. We're with you 👊💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐
9353,"A street without traffic, sign me in."
9354,I would like to see how hard can drop when he sell his doge 😬😬😬
9355,"New coin announced...
KevKoin"
9356,Snoop Doge
9357,"@MeetKevin 
We're going to need another interview? With a better answer than 10 million? Keep the current job to pay off the credit used to invest? Interest on margin for undisclosed time? Sell at a realistic goal and use some profits to re place a buy if you still see potential? Keep until you can just spend it all in Doge form on Tesla cyber trucks? I like the real Estate idea? Try to teach him a little. I've been holding too since early February. Up 400+% With calculations in market cap potentials/realistic sell goal & time line set. #DogeFamily"
9358,Guys should stop convincing him to sell and let him watch how it all ends
9359,I love his beard and the fact he is so humble.
9360,pet stores should accept doge 📈
9361,"Disagree with this guy, but can't help but like him and respect his convictions."
9362,if your goal is to make money trading stock or cryptocurrency do not listen to this
9363,"BTC in horizontal trough for 3 months while ETH, Bitcoin Cash and Doge soar.  
It's because BTC priced itself out of the psychologically satisfying range of most retail buyers.
ETH, DOGE and BCH are more attractive because the average person can afford many or multiple coins.  It just feels better.
Retail BTC hodlers might sell stagnant BTC to catch upswing of more affordable appreciating altcoins.
Could be the start of a vicious feeding frenzy that crashes the whole house of cards but maybe not."
9364,True💎hands
9365,THEY SHOULD CHANGE DOGE LOGO TO HIS FACE!
9366,Replace the wall street bets emoji with diamond hands with this guy
9367,Dogecoin is a hustle.. fake .. buy gold or silver..
9368,It is finding mass adoption
9369,I wanted to follow him but I only found a lot fake profiles can you post his info. Thanks

In high-power mechanics, electro-plasma was a super-energized plasma used to transfer energy from a central power source using plasma conduit transfer. Extremely high-powered warp plasma, drive plasma, or magnetic plasma was used as a plasma stream to facilitate the torsion spin ratio. This in turn agitates the quantum potential. All that is is formed by this hyper spin ratio. Mass, even huge mas, is only a silent lucid real time in the holographic multi-verse within the total spiritual/matrix/matter/ muter/mother/womb-man.In “An Ancient Warning,” Schoch introduced his newest alternative theory, about “plasma.” Written around the time in 2010 when there was a brief flurry of concern about coronal mass ejections from the sun (as there was again this year), Schoch jumped on the bandwagon and suggested that these eruptions from the sun caused elaborate light shows in the prehistoric skies around the time that such solar eruptions allegedly caused the end of the last Ice Age. These light shows so impressed our ancestors, cowering from solar-flare-induced climate change, that they recorded them for all time by using the random patterns in the sky as the basis for the characters in the first writing system, which has mysteriously survived in the rongorongo script of Easter Island without leaving a trace anywhere else on earth, except for the Nazca lines.  He also thinks that the “plasma event” light show at the end of the ice age (c. 9700 BCE) is also the “original basis for the Atlantis legends” because it matches Plato’s account. Of course, there is only one Atlantis story, and it wasn’t a legend. It was Plato’s allegory about Athens. Schoch believes that the rongorongo tablets—the few that survived missionary zeal of mass destruction of such""devilish"" artfacts. He thinks we need to work on deciphering these texts to learn about the plasma event before it recurs. Rongo Rongo are the oldest surviving writings in the world, faithfully recording the “plasma event” of 9700 BCE! Whom is He trying to teach? To whom is He explaining His message? To infants just weaned from milk? To babies removed from the breast? For they hear: “Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line; a little here, a little there.” Indeed, with mocking lips and foreign tongues, He will speak to this people.""

9372,Pump it🚀🚀🚀🚀
9373,Be careful people! Don't get sucked in to this bs.
9374,This guy values clout more than $2 million.
9375,he’s the doge jesus
9376,2.50...my cousin said it's going to 2000. Dollars.
9377,"When meme crypto currencies catch the attention of mainstream billionaires, I stay away!"
9378,AMC to the mooooon!
9379,Keep wearing that hoodie. It’s good luck
9380,Funny thing is Dogecoin got a better chance to become a secondary currency for the world for everyday people since its 127 billion of it versus Bitcoin cuz now Bitcoins at 50k Plus it's only good for rich people to keep for the government can't tax their wealth cuz they're paying less taxes on bitcoin versus if they would have kept that money in cash in their Bank so yeah don't want if I go to a dollar to $3 and stay there it will be a good backup currency for when people travel to different countries as a backup since it'll be between the regular price of different currencies
9381,pro the doge in house y'all 😃
9382,"Kevin told him ""meet me on this corner""    not wanting him to know where he lives"
9383,DeepFuckingValue sold some of GME for profit. There's nothing wrong with securing profits for your own life.
9384,Take the money and run man. If Doge made you rich then cash out now and go live you best life.
9385,"Meme currency is not new thou. Try search for banana money that the japanese used before. 

All because of trust; We believe USD is the trading money globally and hence that fiat control the world. So if we believe and trust crypto is the future, it will be! Millienial like me and you are in the working world already so is time for us to change the system."
9386,"Not sure ,,,,but, I would have sell on high done something with the money.....make it grow .....so, many other ways to go....good luck.."
9387,Lool the social media pump antics are real 🤣🤣
9388,Can't you just sell than buy more?
9389,Dogecoin is a deflationary currency disguised as a fiat currency
9390,"I like this guy and wish him the best.  When he said about GameStop being little guys against hedge funds but Doge is against nobody. If all the winners cashed out where would the money come from? When you win other people must lose. The losers are just the less fortunate members of the same Doge cult. Same as the lottery, millions buy, few people win. The money walks from losers pocket to the winners pocket. The state gets the tax, the broker makes money too. I admire him for his persistence and for sticking to his plan. I could be wrong but maybe the original cult is now minority."
9391,Give me a break 😒
9392,Nice try meet Kevin
9393,8:55 He says it's the Amazon as a Amazon truck passes by him. I wonder if he knew the Amazon van was there? Or if it was subliminal and that is why he mention Amazon.
9394,Kevin's creeped out by the Doge Millionaire's eyes.
9395,"This way of investing is absolutely dangerous.

I’m sure 15 years ago “someone” yolo’d into some stock and made $2.5 million but there was no social media to amplify the story!

But now we have YouTube and TikTok making people believe that buying a stock or crypto is kin to buying a dang lottery ticket.

This will all end badly..."
9396,He should buy more doge
9397,I’m outta of money. keep buying the dip 😂😂😂😂
9398,Dude has become an overnight sensation.
9399,"I hope it hits $9.9 million for him and dips back down below a penny.
I also hope it goes back up to $10mill the next bullrun, but I want the world to test this man's diamond hands. He's in such significant profits that it is easy to talk with such confidence."
9400,"This is the biggest change of all that needed to happen. An awakening. A realization. That, We The People, are ready for change. A change is gonna come. And it’s right in front of us. We ain’t scared no more 👊🏾"
9401,"This is great! If you can't tell by my name GME/GameStop sparked my interest as well lol Here I am months later, understanding how stocks, crypto, DeFi, NFT's etc. and how the market works thanks to Kevin and other channels on YT. Never learned any of this in school or family/friends. Just dedication to actually learn and research and not get caught up in the hype. Best decisions I've ever made. Big S/o to Kevin for all the wealth of knowledge."
9402,This guy is a rocket chaser
9403,The next big coin is Shiba Inu
9404,Didnt see this coming...watching...
9405,This guys a legend! Great character.
9406,"i love the irony of bitching about a weak market and bad boomers while promoting bullshit like gme, amc, cciv or doge all day long"
9407,"New video from my favorite creator. 
Meet let’s keep walking a little bit Kevin."
9408,"I'd love to see Elon Musk send the DOGE-1 Satelite to the moon, but I'd also love to see China send SHIBA-1 Satelite to the moon using SHIB as well in some form of friendly Space Race competition. That would be super cool and give both sides a method to shill their thing."
9409,Come on Kevin you can make contact with him while he talks🤣🤣🤣🤣
9410,DOGECOIN TO $100!
9411,"My son did the very same thing but not as much but he got in when it was sub cents and put 3000.00 bucks on it in mid 2018.  He said if it hits a $1.00 he will be up  ~225,000. If Doge hits 5 bucks he will be a millionaire as well and he is only 24 years old."
9412,Nah I'm to old to hold I make ten million I cash out then live easy. Besides I don't need expensive things so ten million would last till I die.
9413,He dismisses the idea that Elon is just making fun of doge. I think that is a big mistake.
9414,$Bonfire 🔥🚀🪐
9415,GO DOGE ! FOR THE PEOPLE! HOLD IT AND IT WILL GET PAST A $1
9416,I'm excited for pro the doge!!  Loved the video!!
9417,💎🙌🏽
9418,"You know you’re dedicated when you watch your Dogecoin Fortune drop from $3,000,000 to $2,000,000 in 24 hours and still refuse to sell just enough to pay off your 6-figure debt that keeps eating away at you every month 😂"
9419,Is the title ironic? Lol I missed the part of the video where they thought it was gonna go to 2.50.
9420,Sucks that certain states don't allow for buying doge coin and I live in one of them......
9421,So WHO is going in on THE DOGE?🐶
9422,lets keep walking a lil hahaa 10x
9423,THANK YOU SO MUCH KEVIN!!! This conversation really put things into perspective for me!!! You made great points! 🤲🏼💎

9438,Future President and Vice President of the United States...
9439,I just know this video is gonna b crazy looking back in 5 years
9440,this guy is stupid as hell
9441,Nope it isn’t
9442,This guy is a total clown.
9443,Wow this guy will lose a lot of money.
9444,Goat 1st generation thank you 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤙
9445,I believe in doge. The family part of this community is amazing.

9448,Nice work
9449,"Good interview, not like Andre or Graham who were pushing their beliefs on him.  And I like Andre and Grahm but was disappointed at how they treated him."
9450,guys buy dogecoin but wear masks outside lol
9451,"Mark Cuban - Doge is a crypto that people will actually use,  not bury in a hole and will away when they die"
9452,Shib 💎👐
9453,Hope it works out but once dogecoin gets whipped out then more money into other cryptos
9454,Kevin's advice to this dude its so on poiunt. He will be broke next year.
9455,Sometimes you just got to go with the flow 😎 I reckon musk is sponsoring him to hold 😂😂 so won’t lose either way 👍🙏
9456,"yes, mushrooms do this to you"
9457,Thanks Kevin!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
9458,"I'm fully convinced he is a paid actor... Everything about him, consistency of image, how well groomed he is, the camera presence.... He is hired to promote Doge, I bet everything on it."
9459,Hey man sell your doge to the people 5 or 10 dollars person. More doge being made every day. Your doge is losing value every day
9460,DogeCoin
9461,Safemoon 😆😆😆
9462,This guy is too emotionally invested
9463,I’d paper hand that 2 million out of doge. Bye Felicia.
9464,SHIBA
9465,"Good dude but this is so fucking dumb.  There is no value or innovation in doge.  That’s why he only talks about community and no tech.  It’s going to crash and burn, stay away!!"
9466,Doge will be worth $10 one day. Mark my words.
9467,"Kevin’s all like “You are Don Quixote, and I do not understand your kind at all.”"
9468,YO Kevin stop looking at us its wierd
9469,Great interview. Great questions and answers. Thanks fellas...I am a small fry hodler. Buying the dips!!!
9470,Meme coin with no value is going to $2.50😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂... I'm a millennial. Most millennials are idiots... Coin is going to $0... Just wait... Talk to me 5 years from now... Tesla is going to $50... I'm just here to watch 2 idiots talk about bs...
9471,Video sponsored by excepting Doge soon Amazon
9472,He is an idiot. Never heard of him before. He is holding for no reason
9473,You might want to blur out your street name.
9474,"The moto is 

If he hodl 

Then I’ll hold 

🚀🚀🚀 doge to the moon"
9475,7:11 Imma have to disagree now Silbert just shorted doge after SNL so I think the rich guys of wall street are fighting against us now in crypto. The fact that Silbert said he shorted it on a website and hasn't even gotten an investigations says a lot that the sec relies on shorts for the market
9476,"He doesn't like fiat currency because it's inflationary so he proceeds to by DOGE, which is inflationary."
9477,"This is how “fake it till you make it” exactly looks like.
All these “diamond” handers will sell at the bottom."
9478,✊🏻✊🏻 keeping his word to the people.
9479,There are/were people shorting Doge. I have a multi-millionaire friend that lost 250k shorting Doge. He said the damn kids took his lunch money! :D
9480,This guy is an icon
9481,I love his attitude and him holding to his word.  Doge power to the players.
9482,This guy definitely smoked a few bleezys before this interview
9483,"i hope Kevin realizes the American ""system"" is all controlled by Zionists only loyal to Israel"
9484,He gonna hit 10 mil way before next year. Mark my words
9485,Either way he will be rich he growing on YouTube n getting alot fame so his channel longer he holds he will become more famous
9486,That dudes face and hoodie belong on a coin. 👍
9487,He’s just such a good guy. Doge is do only good everyday... this guy does good.
9488,"He’s a little intense, but man. I respect his commitment and energy. It’s contagious, no matter how unrealistic it is."
9489,Pro is teaching the newbies how to invest by using diamond hands instead of trying to time the market and losing money
9490,Did those people randomly come up and film you guys? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
9491,One year or 10 million means he expects it to triple in a year. I think he’s right. Also most people don’t know bitcoin transactions are 7 per second and doge is 33 per second. That’s important.
9492,"Its hilarious listening about ""revolution"", holding it for the people, etc.   We are in massive bubble across the board.  Cryptos, OTCBB, pink sheets, real estate, etc.   There have been pink sheet stocks that ran up 2,000,000% in less than 3 months.  This bubble blows 1999/2000 out of the water.  And all bubbles end the same way, in a massive collapse.   All these newfound financial revolutionary gurus will end up broke just like all the others in prior bubble pops.  Remember you have made nothing until you cash out."
9493,Sooo dumb
9494,"The day I can grow a beard like pro the Doge, I’ll sell my coin.... or the day I can grow a full connecting beard.... in other words, I ain’t never selling 💎 🙌🏻"
9495,Kevin’s wife has health issues so he’s obviously not going to put her at risk.
9496,"Please do a video on Cubfinance, because the project has grown in size almost 20x since launch, and it has new features never seen before in DeFi history: a three blockchains token, a one click bridge between Ethereum and Binance smart chain and a cross DeFi platform farm earning tokens from two DeFi platforms at the same time."
9497,"As much as I really want him to sell some to have a nice chunk in the bank, he's so nice I really want to see him hit that 10 mil!"
9498,"Doge haters

2015 - joke coin,  will never hit .0001 
2016 - joke coin,  will never hit .001
2018 - joke coin,  will never hit .005
2021 - joke coin,  will never hit .01. 
February-  joke coin,  will never hit .05
March - joke coin,  will never hit .1 
April - joke coin,  seriously guys,  stop it....
May - after a 300,000% gain,  Doge topples 20% after hosting SNL.   Haters - SEE,   Joke coin,  you should all sell now!!!"

9503,Lol!!  Fantastic!!
9504,This guy is awesome!!
9505,Yes
9506,Doge will NOT have a bigger MARGIN CAP than Bitcoin.
9507,I would cash out!!! Doge been sitting around .43-.53 for a few days.
9508,This man had nothing but great things to say about doge! Why isn’t he like Elon
9509,I feel nervous for him. Doesn’t he know crypto is also manipulated by whales ?
9510,Why does Kevin seem so fake in this?... The whole time
9511,definitely 2.50 or higher
9512,"All I know is I bought $130 in kishu Inu a week ago and now it's worth $5,000"
9513,He sounds like it’s his first time up to bat .... but I am holding doge too 🤷🏼‍♂️
9514,Kevin becoming to much
9515,"10:25 - Problem with cash is that it’s not a meme.
That’s all you need to know.
Who “you” is will vary in this audience 🤔😉"
9516,Safemoon
9517,Kind of ironic that this guy is anti currency because you can print infinite USD...dogecoin has no limit either on supply.

9529,This guy is doge son
9530,Wait a min???? This the guy from hiphopdx?????
9531,Idk this isn't you Kevin this guy. Just pushing
9532,If doge becomes the reserve currency on Saturn or Jupiter then maybe....
9533,He will reach to 10 millions soon. Good job
9534,Love this kinda informational vlog content
9535,"I'll buy only because meet Kevin is guaranteeing this. If it wasn't for meet Kevin, I would've never bought dogecoin."
9536,"I am sorry, but i do not believe this guy, when he said that he is going to sacrafice himself i just rolled my eyes  at this moment. It is so cliche, there is no doubt he wants profit, even though he does not  cashout yet. Crypto winter is not a joke, we will see -90% correction (btw i have doge coins as well as other crypto)"
9537,I’m not cashing out either
9538,this guy is a living meme
9539,Is this guaranteed by meet Kevin???
9540,Ethereum guys rallying 🚀🚀🚀
9541,Doge to the ground.
9542,Unsubscribed from Kevin.
9543,He should sell some Doge and buy some class cause he has 0!
9544,I am still regret selling my doge  0.055@20usd capital... Sold 0.05775@21usd bitter lesson
9545,I’m so happy Kevin is meeting him I haven’t watched yet but I know he won’t encourage him to paper hands like others he’s met
9546,"I feel like this dude is honestly just riding the Doge hype train for profit, and honestly doesn't care about crypto changing the face of currency."
9547,f-gotta buy more doge...brb
9548,Maybe altcoins are like computer operating systems.  Do you remember in the 1980's when there were so many operating systems competing against one another.  And now there are only a few with most using Microsoft Windows.  Maybe most of the alt coins will simply  go extinct and become historical footnotes.
9549,Bahahahahahaha
9550,DOGE TO THE MOOOOOOOOON! 🚀 🌙
9551,My guy Kevin treated him like maryjane from half baked... spent no money on that date.
9552,"Visa and Mastercard are insured, backed all over the world, and accepted almost everywhere.... Crypto has none of that yet. It's pure speculation."
9553,Good people
9554,"Please sell your dogecoin, it’s very bad for the crypto movement. Dogecoin has no real use case… Its a joke anyway do as you please and congratulations to those who got rich on a joke."
9555,Great questions
9556,"I wonder did you cash out yet? or still, holding?"
9557,"i think its highly unlikely , but this guy is gonna learn a big lesson when the biggest doge wallets decide to sell out one day lol.. i would take my main capital off  the table by now"
9558,Don’t put all your money in Doge at all time highs just because this guy does... especially if you can’t ha for losing 10-70% I’m the matter of a day. The crypto bull market will eventually end. And there’s only a few wallets holding majority of Doge.
9559,I'm a u.s. dollar millionaire 😎 good luck everyone!
9560,My feeling is this man is way smarter than most people give him credit for :)
9561,Lol 😂😂😂😂
9562,Doge lasted 8 years. Almost every meme company is over 20 years and didnt start off as a joke
9563,How’s your Portfolio doing right now Kevin? Tomorrow’s gonna be a great day. You’d be an idiot not to sell all your doge coin right now. There is an unlimited supply of it
9564,"@12:40 it's very unlikely I'd use BTH, or other high value crypto to purchase anything centralized. There worth more to just hold. In my opinion:  Doge, on the other hand? Could replace cash, or credit cards for easier, and faster transactions."
9565,Respect
9566,My Doge Brother!
9567,Thanks to Digibyte your Dogecoin is secured. Doge and Digibyte to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
9568,"I understand his perspective and wish him well but holding all is not smart business. What’s wrong with taking 25%. That doesn’t make you a pussy, it makes you very comfortable!!!"
9569,In case people are wondering.. you can short Doge. But you will lose trying.
9570,Dogecoin Millionaire is such a likeable dude.
9571,Dogecoin is the oldest altcoin
9572,To the moooooon!!! $10 mill baby!!
9573,He needs to realize how blessed he is and cash out. Wanting to hit this arbitrary $10m which is just a # he likes in his mind and not based on anything smart is just straight degen. I like this guy I really do but he might learn the hard way I hate to say it. He already lost like $1m from peak when he knew it would dip after SNL why would you not sell??
9574,shit is going back to 2 cents
9575,"Doge - we meet again LTC,  the circle is now complete.   When I last saw you I was the learner and you the master.   Now I am the master.

9578,"I have been in doge since Dec. 2018, unfortunately not as much as could have."
9579,"Be careful, the whales have a lot of power 🔋"
9580,Who’s taking bets on whether this guy is gonna lose his hoodie... err shirt... in Doge or cash out a millionaire at the end of the day? 😂  I got my 2 cents on losing him going broke.
9581,"If he loses it all, he will never financially recover."
9582,Kevin is tryin to get his steps in
9583,Im in if hes in dogemafia
9584,Walmart doesn’t even accept Apple Pay 🙄. It will be trillions of years before they accept crypto .
9585,poopoo Dookie coin is UP 4% btw
9586,"Bro sell a little bit.. like $200,000"
9587,"Seems like a good dude, sad to think he’s going keep walking until he steps in front of a bus; there’s 160+ billion of these things, it’s just math and knowing markets. 
At $.13 Digibyte is far superior to Doge in every way, not to mention encompassing beautifully the very cause that he stands for. My experience has been when blessed with a pump like this, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, take that cash and move to the next undervalued smart investment opportunity."
9588,"Hey Kevin, never bet against Elon Musk!💎🤲"
9589,Doge more than likely going to .025 rather than 2.50
9590,This guy is a loser?
9591,I'd be responsible to sell doge to cover your loan. Just show people the responsible side of investing.
9592,I'm curious on how you are okay with your pothead buddy there fxxxxxg all those people who bought that dogecoin and then dumped it... pump n dump prices of crap
9593,I feel like this video is harmful to new investors
9594,audio is really scuff on this one
9595,"Prothedoge uniform, this hoodie has been on national tv!"
9596,"Whether he is up or down a million, he lives so frugally that it literally makes no difference to him if his bank account says $2,000,000 or $2,000. He doesn't have kids or a mortgage so this is all play money to him. I'm glad he's having fun but I fear in 10 years he's gonna look back and wish he had a house paid down and money to last him the rest of his life without working."
9597,After taxes he’s a thousander
9598,"Lol, when you’re right for the wrong reasons..."
9599,I am inspired to find the next dogecoin forsure
9600,Love him!!!
9601,i love that pawn shop meme lmao
9602,"You should team up with MatPat and do a GameTheory on Dogecoin. Like, Dogecoin can reach 100$ and here is how."
9603,His only exit plan is to avoid getting run over by Amazon vans before it hits $10 mil.
9604,Keanu  to the moon
9605,Keep it up! 💯 🤫
9606,Is that a doge Moses? 😆
9607,Yeaaa Ventura! Im from Carpinteria! You are awesome man!
9608,Meet ‘let’s keep walking a little bit’ Kevin
9609,Both are genius
9610,He has no perspective. He doesn't realize how lucky he is and how quickly it can go away. He reminds me of friends who were committed to holding stocks and lost it all. It is painful to watch.
9611,This guy is rolling hard or something! He keeps rubbing his hands together like he has anxiety lol
9612,Will someone buy him a new damn Shirt!!😒😒😒. Jesus'... he's worn it for a month straight

9616,I need to cop that hoodie 😤
9617,Loser will be broke in six months 😂
9618,"On its face cryptos seem like a digital fiat currency. Backed by  ""Computational Power and a wall of Encrypted Energy"" seems like a semantic digital difference from backed by ""The full faith and credit of the U.S.""? This I do know that when you mess with the U.S. dollar, you have a high probability of incurring lethal wrath. Just ask Lincoln, JFK, and Gaddafi. Cryptos DO NOT HAVE A STANDING ARMY OR THE ABILITY TO ISSUE BONDS! When push comes to shove, ""someone"", U.S., China, or Russia will come in and simply TAKE IT. It will be like the school bully stealing the geek's lunch money. Who will protect crypto? Crypto does not have a chance. The only OUTSIDE chance is if crypto can somehow BUY OFF the corrupt U.S. Federal Reserve. Crypto WANTS to be autonomous, but at the same time wants and will needs the PROTECTION of the precise entities they are trying to put out of business. Crypto's protector is their competitor. Crypto WILL never survive."
9619,All I ever been hearing for the past year with Robin Hood is nothing but scams and holding the people back from making money why is anybody still going through Robin Hood soon as I heard the bad things about a year ago from them I never had any intentions there’s so many other trade platforms that you don’t need Robin Hood

9637,Keep up the great videos Kevin!
9638,if Jesus Christ lived today....
9639,These two kids will be broke soon ? Good luck kids !
9640,"Good sh$%, Doge Millionaire  on meet Kevin! Let's Gooooo!"
9641,Hate to break it but this guy is delusional. He’s probably never experienced crypto winter like some of us have and doesn’t understand the 90-95% drawdowns that can happen. It’s easy to talk big when you’re up big but let’s see if his mindset is still the same if doge goes down to 0.01.
9642,Next visit for the hoodie man is with out a doubt Jeremy!!
9643,is it too late to buy DOGE and be profitable?
9644,"Safemoon is the next one, gl to all."

9649,Dude… you just lost 2 million bucks. He is gonna Be lucky if he can cash out at 1 mil
9650,Where is this neighborhood? House looks amazing there!😇
9651,This is just the beginning of the crypto where you guys see crypto in 10 years
9652,Guys check musketeer  its up 2000% in three weeks and had strong community.   On telegraph and twitter
9653,CIA made facebook because Tom wouldnt sell.
9654,This guy doesn't own crap 🙄 maybe some bull crap  investment?
9655,"Kevin just doesn’t understand how the mind of someone without any greed functions 😂. Just because you’re not a millionaire anymore it doesn’t mean your like if over, 99% of the world isn’t a millionaire and they live perfectly fine"
9656,Hit guy isn’t smart😢
9657,A fool and his money ....
9658,This is christoph waltz

9661,um-this guy don't have diamond hands-he got diamond balls
9662,This man's word is worth millions. Respect.
9663,So ...dogecoin going to a dollar !
9664,"Kevin, it is very distracting that you look at the camera while he is talking to you. It is not about you, it is about him. He looks at when he talks and you look at the camera and I’m here like, with! I’m witnessing you being impolite to him and it drives me crazy."
9665,someone who paper handed can never be diamond handed. Diamond remains the same forever.
9666,"""my research on doge"" these crypto guys are idiots. sure they are making money but only because of the meme drive not fucking ""research"". if i want investment advice i dont hit up the neighborhood pot dealer."
9667,to the moon baby
9668,etoro much coin ad in the mid of this vid lol
9669,this is the most desperate pump attempt ive seen this week
9670,Is there a way that he can borrow against his position? I really want this guy to succeed. He's richer than me but I do want him to do very good. I did sell some Doge at 69c but I am buying back more when I can. Doge is the ultimate middle finger to hedgies.
9671,"I love the way this man thinks, so happy Kevin interviewed him"
9672,It's funny that the millionaires say sell crypto currency for feyayt currency to be safe.  Feyayt currency is plumiting in value. Every dollar that you own is worth 60 cents and falling the more they print.
9673,"much respect prothedoge. If hes in, IM FUCKING IN. BUYING THE DIP"
9674,I was at 82k when robinhood stopped the sales of gme.  Cost me 42k since I have managed to bring it down to 17k.  Half is in doge and slightly less then half in etherium and 2 options that expire in 2023
9675,Plenty of hedgies in doge
9676,The irony one day of that Amazon truck passing in the background of this video 😂🚀🚀📦

9678,"I feel like my intelligence was lowered every second I watched this, and I don't feel bad saying that."
9679,Keep dreaming with dreaming coin? It will all crash? Just invest with Real dollars?
9680,"If he not selling, i aint selling"
9681,"I doubt it get to $2.50, because of this very fine detail. Moving Tesla’s earning into Bitcoin is one of the factors that increased it 5x. Accepting Dogecoin as a payment method (among the many other methods) is not the same as Dogecoin being the only payment method Tesla will accept. But hopefully this will be enough to push it to $1 or possibly $1.337."
9682,Sit on it till July 4 when Trump returns. Don't worry about capital gains. Flashbang Joe and his bullshit will be gone ! There won't be any income tax !!!
9683,Quite a mind Kev.
9684,Hey I just figured out how the big hedge funds and the government can kill Dogecoin..... They need to get Pro the Doge too 10 million then he sells and everyone sells?
9685,Was that a Tesla roadster??
9686,Could I be that people are using doge at the mavs because they don’t want to give up their other crypto such as bitcoin?
9687,SHIBA 🔥🔥🔥🔥
9688,It’s like this guy hit the lottery and wants to hit it again. I just want this man to take out the money Idc . Help your family man. Help yourself we the people don’t care . I want you to be a winner
9689,Same Hoodie!! Building his brand!!!! Buy buy Doge!!! My opinion only!!!
9690,Thumbs up 👍before I even viewed the video 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂 your subject makes me giddy
9691,Lol cmon Kevin stop milking that YouTube money
9692,"The utility of a coin will eventually rule the crypto space. Coin with no utility - no future, no pump and dump, and no euphoric rises and falls. Coin with utility - future of instant liquidity, actual real-world use cases. In the future, utility and real-world use cases will define the actual value of a coin, not mass hysteria."
9693,This is great Kevin.
9694,They say the same thing about XRP in 2018....
9695,Hoodie Coin coming in 🔥
9696,"Certain countries should hate it because it’ll give people buying power in them 1,000 Lyra would probably get a nice amount of dog & be able to buy things cheaper than their currency, etc..."
9697,Nothing wrong with taking a little profit to improve your life and hold the rest.
9698,"Because of him (doge millionaire), I’m holding my position until doge hits at least $2.50."
9699,What's the deal? Doge is at $.49...
9700,"I like that analogy 

GME is MySpace and DOGE is Facebook
So…

LEASH is Google and SHIB is YouTube 
🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕"
9701,I'm going to feel really bad if this guy loses everything
9702,Lmaoooo I was laughing like crazy when Kevin said he was getting reamed everyday by Tesla 😂😂😂 such a real and genuine moment 😭😭
9703,"Awesome video, I went all out on AMC and holding... Have some doge but rather put in on AMC for now till we squeeze... its inevitable. Then will go all out on Cardano and Doge .. AMC gorilla gang from Sydney"
9704,Yall just passing him around lmfao
9705,@prothedoge is exactly right.  If he's in then I'm in. I held strong through the dip.  I told my wife we're going to the moon. #HoldStrong #ProTheDoge #ThePeoplesCrypto #IDogeYouSo
9706,this guy really thinks the US is going to build aircraft carriers using a dog coin lmao!!
9707,This guy is freaking amazing. Love his energy!
9708,HE SOLD AMC FOR DODGE!!!!!!!!!!!!????????? AHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!! DISLIKE
9709,Dogecoin to the moon 🌝
9710,Pro and his iconic hoodie
9711,Is Kevin getting gray hair?
9712,Like he said he’s different “scared money don’t make money”
9713,Kevin left his house!!
9714,even if doge falls it won't go back to sub $0.10
9715,i admire his diamond hands 💎👏
9716,Love your YouTube channel Kevin ❤👍👍
9717,"Love the hard questions Kevin, hearing the answers... i can't justify why i can invest in doge"
9718,"[Power to the coins..imagine watching all the coins, poker , and  sports videos but afraid to get on board."
9719,HODL fashion trends like hoodies and white people who talk kinda hood for no apparent reason.
9720,Dogecoin going back to .05
9721,"He is a good man, but I have one question and I hope he sees it.
He does so much for the doge people by not becoming a millionaire, but will the doge people do the same for him?"
9722,"Holding till $1,000 +"
9723,Kevin meeting Memestars
9724,Your guest should cash out some and look to make some real investments with that money. He shouldn't feel obligated to hold on because of a cause. It's time to secure his future. He's won a lottery and he should take his winnings before the government regulates the hell out of it and everyone runs and leaves the unfortunate few still holding the position. My 2 cents.
9725,"“With Doge, there’s no super rich guy losing money”.

Lol, shh, nobody tell this guy about the US government."
9726,"He literally has no reason, except the factor of musk promoting it and seems like somehow that shit worked out"
9727,So hodl?
9728,Doge all the way 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌛
9729,Bruh you so late to this crypto shit 😅😂🤣 @Tesla Soon!!! 🐕🪙🖕🏽
9730,"7:10 Plain wrong, of course there's shorting for Dogecoin. In fact I made banks off shorts pre-SNL debut. The suits are all in on this, first you can't go on margin with Binance, then they halt selling on Robinhood during SNL. And then there's Bitcoin correlation with 10 Year treasury like Kevin says, which drags the entire crypto market with it. This guy is propped to go back to square one with this ""symbolic movement"" attitude. Atleast the GME dude knows when to take profits."
9731,I think you doxed yourself phone number on Tesla
9732,"The funny thing is: his DOGE is on Robinhood, he does not own any of it"
9733,I can't wait to see this fool crying in 6 months I woulda sold every last one that shitcoin is heading back to below a penny when btc dumps like it always does btc runs everything if you think these prices are here for good you haven't seen the devil come out yet like it does in crypto
9734,Kevin is hover handing him in the thumbnail.   Clearly he we use this as defense when dogebrah sues him for sexual harassment (we know jeremy was there).
9735,"Kevin's unattractive ass looks to be real conceited, stop talking over dogepro.... JEEZ"
9736,Stop trying to make the man sale his Dogecoin it haven't hit the moon yet for him. 😉🥳🥳🥳🚀🚀🚀🚀🌛
9737,"🔥DOGE, ETC, LTC 🚀🚀🚀🌕"
9738,Replace doge with bitcoin in this interview and it goes from 2iq to 200iq
9739,dudes an idiot fucking sell and run
9740,is he apart of the top 100 addresses for dogecoin??
9741,"Crazy not to lock in a mil, could still be a “doge millionaire” and be set for life."
9742,So there's going to be a huge sell off at 2.50? lol
9743,This year dogcoin millionaire. Next year dogcoin centllionaire
9744,"We're up against each other's emotions, good luck may the strong survive"

9748,"This guy is an idiot, but Kevin is very nice, admirable tolerance :)"
9749,"crypto is a scam, and his hoodie stinks"
9750,I’m just laughing at how the Amazon employee doesn’t even know they just passed 2 multi millionaires 😂
9751,The final boss... is elon musk
9752,This guy is a degen. He needs to cash out and be thankful he hit the lotto. Can he really handle the swings of DOGE goes back to $.25?
9753,Kevin. I’m an official safemoon moderator and would like to setup the interview with you and John. If you can reach out to me on Instagram @Tylerbrownnnn    I will make it happen. Thanks!
9754,U didnt even talk about why its goin to 2.50
9755,Governor Kevin Doing his DoGe Duty.
9756,Lol Kev you can absolutely trust this guy there is no need be doing this interview outside walking around in a nice neighborhood. So awkward. Love this guy absolute legend.
9757,"Robinhood isn’t that secure, bro. Cash that shit before the Dark Web gets to you."
9758,You're better off selling 100% and buy bitcoin and fucking live a hole lot.
9759,I love that this dude’s investment strategy is literally other memes.
9760,Doge is not like GME. GME is the retail investors profiting off of hedge fund shorters. Doge coin is retail investors profiting off of other retail investors.
9761,Take some cash dude. No one would be mad.
9762,This will be I was a millionaire and now im broke because of diamond hands
9763,Would love to just walk around a neighborhood and talk finances with Kevin.
9764,Kevin ‘s trying to keep the conversation moving because he doesn’t want to get the cops called in his bougie neighborhood hahaha
9765,"DogeCoin millonaire comes to visit  MeetKevin in Ventura, CA and  doesn't even get invited to his studio, has to walk streets instead 😒"
9766,"He invested tens of thousands! People at home think they're gonna be like him with their $500 to $1000 investment, ya cheap fawwkkxx"
9767,"I could only watch 2 minutes of this video. Reason: Kevin couldn’t naturally engage with DogeMillionaire without feeling like he had to stare at the camera. In live feeds, don’t acknowledge the camera unless the person you are interviewing directly engages with the camera. I get you’re used to staring at the camera at home but outside, in an interview, just engage with the person... UNLESS the other person is engaging the camera, then you can talk to the third person (camera)."
9768,Kevin is drunk of crypto..... smh
9769,"No one cares abt u in the market, they only care abt ur money"
9770,An outside video. It’s been a while 🥲
9771,SELL IT ! You won the game !!!
9772,"BTC hold wealth
ETH/ETC Smarts contracts/ NFT
DC every day use currency"
9773,Hodllllll to the mooooonnn thank you!!
9774,He wears the same hoodie everyday
9775,"Yikes, he's gonna regret not selling soon...."
9776,"Great interview, liked the format as well...y’all got good chemistry and hopefully he can grill you with some questions soon!"
9777,"This guy is an idiot, but Kevin is very nice, admirable tolerance :)"
9778,That hoodie is going in the national Dogecoin museum one day
9779,To the moon
9780,Kevin O'Leary will be the final boss convincing ProTheDoge to sell
9781,All this guy is doing is gambling.
9782,Watching this video just convinced me to sell
9783,I couldn't take that Doge guy seriously after he said that the problem with USD is that they can keep printing more of it. The fuck he think DOGE is doing?
9784,First off I should of had that title from Doge but anyways proceed 😒😒😒
9785,He’s probably wearing the same underwear too🤣
9786,Please talk about Safemoon! The worlds fastest growing crypto
9787,"You can tell Kevin is really torn on wanting to yolo on Doge , He will soon enough"
9788,"What's with that homeless kind of look? like you a millionaire now, withdraw 100 bucks and groom yourself first."
9789,"#1 .. if you dont understand how to communicate, watch Kevin closely and learn from a master. He is a master communicator 

#2 .. Doge to the moon... but listening to anyone talk about it clearly exposes that it's a meme coin.. the DIAMOND HANDS, BUY THE DIP, TO THE MOON, etc etc wordage is quite odd. backed by a meme..

#3 .. all that being said.. hodl with diamond hands to the moon..

Doge!"
9790,"Major Doge coin buyers are from Robinhood. Hedge funds own 20% of Robinhood, they do manipulate Dogecoin to gain capitals, that's why you see Dogecoin goes up high then drops significantly in several sell off. Plus, you really don't know if you actually own Dogecoin or not because Robinhood can give you IOU every time you buy."
9791,I love the vlog style videos!
9792,Doge is a revolution? God help us..
9793,"You guys been dipping into that devils lettuce haven't ya you giggly bastards. Same bro, same."
9794,"Honestly, a video EVERYONE on youtube needs to see, from Linus Tech Tips to Clear Value Tax"
9795,Dogecoin dude needs to get medical help. Those dark rings around his eyes is likely a prediabetic complication.
9796,He make a good point.  You can’t short crypto.  It’s the bears that short stocks that are the issue with stocks.  With crypto you don’t have that.  Even Warren Buffett said if he could short crypto he would.  It’s this crap that make me want to invest even more money in crypto and forget stocks.
9797,"no technical analysis or anything, just an average joe. love it."
9798,Is that doge Jesus?
9799,"This dude is way more intelligent than I expected, thanks Kevin"
9800,"Kevin: ""let keeps walking""
Kevin trying to walk the dogecoin millionaire off a cliff!"
9801,"Ok, so will anyone ask wtf is up with the hoodie? Does he have humongous ears? Lol"
9802,Sell the coins kid.
9803,"bruh 
I got in at 0.004799 for the lolz
from seeing an Elon tweet . . ."
9804,"No cap I'll be honest I would not be mad if buddy, PRO takes some early profit and travels on his vlog while doge continues to grow. Let us live through you. Oh and shout out to the #gang #Amazon my employer. Blessings!"
9805,"Kevin you should interview Kevin Stevenson, he’s a crypto YouTuber that is highly credible on crypto. He can help teach you about the blockchain and don’t mistake the fact that he’s not Uber wealthy and has million of subs for his intellect on Crypto."
9806,I chipped in 500 bucks in doge. That will be my ps5 money if it doubles lol
9807,$4.20 by end of....
9808,"Kevin, you don’t have to look into the camera like that 🤣"
9809,Doge to 420.69 for ultimate memes.
9810,Lmao Kevins confused by dogeheads explanations
9811,I swear Netflix better come out with this doge documentary down the road.
9812,Hold it till it goes to zero
9813,Love the Ron Perlman interview.
9814,He's the face of Dogecoin ....
9815,It’s not profit until you sell. Until then there’s just numbers on the screen
9816,"If this guy doesn’t sell, I have no sympathy for him. Cryptocurrency is eventually going to collapse like all bubbles and will go to zero."
9817,Millennial Money!!!
9818,"Buddy is a clown hyping DOGE lmfao. I can’t watch this much longer, shill TRUEBIT."
9819,He and DFV are in the Diamond hand Hall of Fame.
9820,BS THIS GUY ALREADY SOLD SOME
9821,Love the double Dutch two lessons you can learn from anyone
9822,Disruptive!
9823,look at the OBV indicator GME is not done.
9824,CARRR!!!!!
9825,Everyone talking about the guys sweater but kevin be doing the same thing with is outfit lmao
9826,Bitcoin is for the Suits. Dogecoin is for the people. Give the Bitcoin for the Suits to play.
9827,"Forget DOGE.  SHIB is going to overtake it, only $0.00003 cents and #20 Crypto."
9828,Stop doing this hype sh*t game. People are losing their money.
9829,"Buddy, I’ve been in crypto for 5 years... I have no idea who tf you are LOL. He’s a big time idiot for not selling lol. He’s not an investor clearly he bought DOGE lol"
9830,"Kevin doesn't seem to connect this dude in the interview , he comes off as some D ouchey reporter that's just firing questions"
9831,Dogecoin to $5 lets gooooooo 🚀
9832,Just take ur money dude at least half
9833,I got in at the same exact time.  I keep buying and holding (even bought the dip myself).
9834,"Wow, how does this guy get interviewed and why am I watching this? Buy the Hoodie!"
9835,After Facebook (Fad) was Instagram... Btw
9836,Buy the dip!
9837,"I am all for the doge bill run but it’s not the people’s currency 😭, it does nothing meaningful for the blockchain and is main to be a stable coin which isn’t stable anymore. Doge will get the Alt coin bump every Alt season but it will crash hard no matter how long people hold. Doge has an infinite money supply just like the FED so it can’t even be use to fight back inflation once the price begin to rise."
9838,I bought the dip too lol
9839,Doge
9840,The PEOPLES CURRENCY
9841,My two favorite people. LOVE IT THANK YOU KEVIN
9842,How in the heck does this guy know who has the most of dogecoin 🤣
9843,Listening to him try to justify Doge’s future when it’s fuelled only but hype is kind of sad. 2 billionaires shilling Dogecoin ain’t a reason for longevity. He just got extremely lucky to where he is now but now logic and reasoning is slowly slipping from him.
9844,"Buy n hold 
Buy ur fam some 
Send ur bois links , let’s get it doges"
9845,LOL this guy is going to get crushed
9846,lets just keep walking a little bit

9849,Shib coin looking alot like doge did before the initial blowup! imagine it hitting even .10!!
9850,He needs a video with Jeremy
9851,No masks? So close together.
9852,Pro the doge looks like Daryl Dixon from walking dead!!
9853,SIGH..Im sorry but doge has more selling to do in the coming weeks. Hope he's not leveraged.
9854,"For the love of God, I hope this video ages well. Bless this  man for he has faith."
9855,The Obi-Wan Kenobi of Doge 🤣

9857,My aunt works for homeland security she said that if all options expire for getting rid of covid a new round of stimulus will need to be issued !!! That should take the end of 2022!!! Masks aren’t coming off with a vaccine!!!  They never worked to begin with if you could smell your own farts! Scam the scammers !!!
9858,I think that Doge is at its bottom so even if it doesn’t go where he wants it to I think he’s safe where he’s at. I don’t see him going lower than where he’s at so that should be a relief.
9859,"Quit with the I'm symbol crap. Sell enough to buy yourself a modest house. Never worry about a place anymore..ever. Had a business partner who in one day trading, his first day ever, He put in 1000, and by the end of the day it was worth 25,000. I said sell, sell, he said noway it will go up more tomorrow. By the time he sat down at his desk in the morning, he had already lost 20,000."

9874,"This dude has to be trolling. ""Doge is the future""."
9875,Sell your doge dude and use it to help people that need the help.  Holding doge isn't going to change the world.

9888,"Seems like a nice dude.  I fundamentally disagree with a lot of his analysis.  But I could be wrong, he could be wrong, and he could still make a shit load of money.  Maybe that money will be doge.

Edit:  Kev tried his best to get him to take profits without being a dick.  Respect."

9902,I'm not f#%king selling! Lol
9903,I think a big part of the run up on crypto has a lot to do with the FED printing dollars I think if he keeps printing then crypto will keep going up
9904,Amazon sponsor @8:50 Lol
9905,this has to be the stupidest shit of all time.
9906,Wish I was as early to Doge as I am to this video.

9919,He sold  safemoon. And elongate to buy more doge
9920,"Buddy..... don’t hold out for these peeps online. If you’ve never had millions - but NOW you do - then TAKE YOUR MONEY and enjoy your life. The single biggest mistake most traders make, much like selling too soon, is NOT selling at the right time. In 5 years, nobody is gonna care whether you sold or no... other than you. Enjoy your good investment and know when it’s time to take your winnings off the table. I’m not hatin bro. It’s just that all of us out here know how this is gonna end. It’s a “revolution” you can’t win. Eventually, the house is gonna beat you."
9921,Yep he’s making more Enron’s on money yotube *
9922,i agree with everything that the doge man said!
9923,Kevin is so obvious man...”so you’re saying that dodge is the best version of game stop”. Lol
9924,Why is he a millionaire if he hasn’t sold anything? It can easily go back down and he could lose 99%. I bought blockcat back in 2017. It went way way up... and then way way down and now nothing. I think you’re only a millionaire if you have the cash
9925,I just don’t see how doge will hold on to it’s value.
9926,2 DA MOOOOOON
9927,Then who’s Instagram!!!!?
9928,"ADA, DC and ETH for me, boyz!! Maybe a short term play on Safemoon. 🤔 Good luck, boyz and gurls. Hope everyone profits. 😎"
9929,Is it just me or dude with beard look like the messiah ? 🤔
9930,He looks like he holds doge.
9931,bro i love this guy's energy
9932,"At the very least take out the initial Doge investment money you put in, pay no tax on that, Then buy the dip, (optional),  let your profits ride you to the Moon!!!"
9933,"He talks about changing the world with dogecoin, but all of this speculative frenzy on assets which aren't used at all for the purpose they're supposed to be valuable has probably made the world a worse place. So I guess he's right, just not how he thinks."
9934,Does dude have a different shirt?
9935,I wanna hang out with kevin too 😔
9936,Kevin keeps staring into my soul when he looks into the camera like that
9937,"I love this guys mindset buy the dip, hold and believe."

9949,Why are those poor guys wearing masks 🤔😒
9950,"This man been wearing the same hoodie since forever now, that’s how you know he ain’t cashed out on his Doge."
9951,Diamonds Hands Doge Boy!

10012,"Crypto market is be coming more appealing to investors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, with no doubt in mind that we are not only going bull with little signs of stoppn. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position, The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen.

Cryptocurrencies are like software right? if it is so then they would be getting updates to maintain or add something to them right? Since we all know that there are unlimited supply of doge so is it possible that it can be limited with some kind of updates to the Cryptocurrency?"

10056,"As a day trader, I love the volatility."
10057,"<< I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies / lnvesttors on how the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Mr. Allen with is guide and signal service i 've made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues ,, connect him on ͲҽӀҽ ցɾ ąʍ @Allencryptotrading all the best"
10058,"Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just as the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable., I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Mr Allen, although I have been into numerous services Mr Allen stands out with experience and expertise playing in her favor... I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Mr Allen it was easier to understand, Here are her details on Tel- gram  ( @Allencryptotrading ) for his assistance on the strictly crypto-related concern."
10059,"The fact is, BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me, I started with 1 BTC and i've accumulated over 6.5 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Mr Allen. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on Teleqram (@Allencryptotrading) cheers"

10103,"Great content from a technical standpoint, the biggest challenges investors face can range from controlling the impulsiveness to the frailty of compulsion. Most newbies and investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broad market. In essence, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict the future movement of the asset. It takes a lot of time to do this. Why do I find expert opinion in retail, has always been a guide to me and I've enjoyed the signaling service of some with some losses until I've started copying trade notifications from Mr Tony Max to mine in the past 6 weeks and I've seen differences in my portfolio. He is an expected trader with a trading accuracy of 89%. He can be easily contacted via ᴛᴇ ʟᴇ ɢʀᴀᴍ  @Tony_signal22 for more information on profitable trading."
10104,"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull, but BTCis going nuclear. A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Tony Max who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months. After getting in touch with Tony Max an exp:ert in the cryptospace, who showed me how to use his program to make transactions and got 9 B TC with 2.1 B T C  in 2 mon.ths with him. if you are looking for a way to increase your portfolio or investment.

10105,"<I must say. Bitcoin's price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why it's advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Rick Richard. He is always one step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 6.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE-LE-GRAM (@rickrichardcrypto)..."

I think people have to give value to dogecoin not Elon Musk. Even if the price was on $1 or even more, it would’ve crash even bigger because it’s value built on Elon’s popularity not the actual coin. However Now if the price of the dogecoin goes up to $1 or $10, it won’t be because of Elon and it won’t crash.
I think Elon Musk did what he had to do on his end."

10453,"Dude,I love your videos and your knowledge in crypto but I’m quite astonished and shocked that despite being educated, you are also still in dilemma to get the vaccine or not which is absurd. Haven’t you taken vaccinations for Cholera, Typhoid, Polio etc in your childhood? COVID vaccination is nothing different to those and being an educated and influential person on YouTube, you should take a lead and educate people to get vaccination immediately and save India as getting the vaccine is the only way to get away from COVID. If YOU are only in such a dilemma and scared of it, can you imagine about the villagers and illiterate folks? I strongly advise you go get it done right away and also help India get away from it using your channel and that can be a great help as you can save thousands of lives by not getting affected with it and this indeed is great help than providing postmortem help ie, providing some support for the people who already got it and suffering in hospitals. Sorry, if I’m being bit strong but I didn’t expect this from you and you are watching the current situation and still you are not taking it to protect yourself while millions are struggling and desperately waiting to get the vaccine. Btw, my 2 doses are done few weeks ago and no issues whatsoever."

10653,"Adi, I respect your work and efforts a lot what your are doing for the community. Since you are always so sincere in helping others I also want to give you a sincere suggestion which is really from the heart. If you are having doubts on having your vaccine shot, it is a good sign because you have a mind of your own. Just because everybody is doing it, does not mean it is the right thing to do. For more information if you want to get deeper and you should go deeper, because the vaccine is not a joke, it is a genetic therapy and all of those who are getting these shots are taking part in the biggest experiment orchestrated by the elite. Please please inform yourself before you or loved ones decide to get the shot. Here are some names and terms you should search for:
Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdury
Dr. Vandana Shiva
Dr. Rashid Buttar
Event 201
Agenda 2030
ID2020
Great Reset
You and everybody who has not taken the shot yet has the duty to see the bigger picture before letting something inside their body which is irreversible.
Bless you brother. Greetings from Germany"

10918,Polcadot ka lia kuch bolo bhi please 🙏
10919,Bro i seriously advice u to skip this vaccine . There are many reasons to it . Firstly people below the age grp of 50 are fighting with this virus easily with their innate immune system . It's very mild for them and i think u r a healthy young guy and its survival rate is too high for us . Second about these vaccine is that these vaccines are very rushed as they come in a year with no complete raw safety and efficacy data and without studying long term side effects too . These vaccines are still in Emergency authorization means u r a guinea pigs for this experimental vaccines and on also on the ground level i am witnessing people getting vaccinations are facing serious complications of it and even many are dying from it and govt and vaccines manufacturers are not liable for it . so they are easily discarding these side effects.  So no liability means no trust . so plz stay safe not from this virus as this has a survival rate of more than 99% but from the vaccines who are in experimental mode . ... And btw u r a funny and informative guy ma. Luv ur videos🧡🧡

11240,"On Saturday Night Live, Elon can say whatever BS  he wants to - Remember what Jeremy Clarksen on Top Gear BBC said about Tesla back in 2008. He lied and said Tesla is bad and ran out of battery and people must not invest i9n Tesla, Musk tried to sue the BBC and Jeremy Clarkson and they said its just a show and not based on any truth.

So if the system says Jeremy Clarkson can short, push the price of Tesla down by lying about the tesla Vehicle, then how can they stop Elon from say DOGE is the best and price to the moon.

Lets keep a close eye on those bad people at the SEC and government."

Need to keep it in check💲🔥💲
11269,"I'm sorry but this is only hype with no sustantial fundations to its growth... Pure especulation. People are doing it just to be cool and make easy money. There's no serious and solid project on it.

11274,"Dodge is trash and useless but people are buying it... simple as that. There is probably a fair amount of money to gain in it, but eventually people may stop pumping it for the sake of it due to the fact there is no working project.

When it crashes, I hope it crashes hard so the brainless investors learn the hard way that sometimes the faster the money comes, the over inflated your wallet becomes, and the faster the money goes."

You secretly invest in a coin nobody else believes, and when you raise the price on the level you want , then you squeeze your exchange bye dumping it. You exchange everything for your shitdoge and go away. At all this time, you are secretly using your clients crypto's and fiat currency in order to raise the price and when you decide is the perfect level you dump. Happened many times with shitty stocks on the stockmarket"

11355,"Y’all couldn’t get your pump on 420 doge day. Who do you think owns doge? The community or the whales? I did own doge (for fun) and could’ve made a lot if I held. I like the concept. I only made a hundred bucks so I’m neutral on it as a trade. But reality is. I don’t like inflationary currency that has no developers, and that you rely on celebrities to boost it. I would’ve held it if whales sold when Elon asked. I would’ve liked to see it lower than .045 in order to acknowledge the sale. I’m not going to put my life saving up for 78 whales. Fuck that.

1. Stablecoins(Dai, USDT, USDC, sUSD)

2. Cash out in exchanges

3. POS coins(be aware of scam/shit coins)
Deflationary coins based on POW have been proven to be unsustainable. Staking against inflation can be a good way. e.g. ethereum(hard to be imitated or copied by other cryptos due to its gigantic ecosystem), peercoin(low entry barrier, highly decentralised and trust-less),etc

4. Buy more doge, HODL!!"

11475,"Çrypt0 is the future of this new age and the question traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest¿ Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days, the price of Dogeco!n has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can’t tell if it’s going to bearish or bullish. While others continue to trqde without the fear of making loss, others are patient; It all depends on the pattern with which you trqde and also source of your signals. I would say trqd!ng has been going smoothly after making some amounts of money within two weeks from the comfort of my home with the trqd!ng strategy of @katie_law from T £ | £ g r q m. Her method are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted for ur b!t|co!n related issues."

11494,"Çrypt0 is the future of this new age and the question traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest¿ Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days, the price of Dogeco!n has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can’t tell if it’s going to bearish or bullish. While others continue to trqde without the fear of making loss, others are patient; It all depends on the pattern with which you trqde and also source of your signals. I would say trqd!ng has been going smoothly after making some amounts of money within two weeks from the comfort of my home with the trqd!ng strategy of @DanielWestFx from T £ | £ g r q m. His method are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted for ur b!t|co!n related issues."

11578,"To hustle something means to hurriedly push it along. If you overslept, you'll have to hustle out of the house to get to work on time.
Hustle comes from the Dutch word for ""shake"" or ""toss."" As a noun, a hustle is a busy, hurried scene, like the hustle of the subway at rush hour. We also call the act of swindling a hustle, because it happens so fast. As a verb, hustle can either mean to swindle someone or to hurry them, or to work hard. You can hustle someone out the door. If you hustle, you can earn good tips as a waiter."
11579,Lol people didn’t like his moms response that’s why it dumped. I think it’s more like the banks or the whales playing the game. Everyone buys before snl so we will sell to make the most $$. Highly doubt it was from his moms comment 😂🤣

I give Elon 10/10 for PayPal, Rocketry, Boring. And 9/10 for electric cars. But Crypto???  I think when people are great at certain things they become over confident that they are great with everything. He is Human and this is not unexpected. Yes his high profile pumped Dogecoin to the Moon but understanding crypto uuummmm!  Also as an engineer I can see that Fully Self driving cars are a long way off, especially the way it is being tackled at the moment. I could sort the self driving bit out but it is more complicated than just what’s in the car. And I could have produced really practical, affordable robot helpers by now for every home.

-transfers faster worldwide than fiat currency and at a lower transaction rate. (Extremely high assurance)
-strong community (low assurance)
-Elon musk **claims** he’ll pay out any of the whales that want to sell (not much assurance but maybe)

I don’t think it’s ridiculous for DOGE to exceed the difference of the transfer time and fee (could easily see it at $2-$5 if mass adoption happens), I think it could achieve that strong support if DOGE website offers IOS wallets, that are capable of mining using their phone/iPad gpu, and can seamlessly convert through Apple Pay transactions."

11699,Last year taught everyone that investing in different streams of income should be a necessity because your proceeds could help you get through the rainy days. My utmost concern is every time I buy a stock that's supposed to be a big hit it ends up dropping and just never moving again

11725,"Btc is backed up by its use of darknet markets. Since feds are catching up on the btc technology and know how to trace the coins, large tumbler services that made it able to obscure the flow of btc got shut down for money laundering, almost all darknetmarkets have switched to monero. The only crypto I would invest in that I would consider safe is the one ppl buy heroin meth etc with all the other coins are Ponzi schemes. If btc does well the Ponzi altcoins do well, but there's nothing behind it, the only thing that's driving prices up is more money being invested. I went into Shiba coin and almost 5x it, burned my fingers and pulled out( I could've almost 10x but I was sleeping..) next  krypto that get hype like that I won't be that greedy anymore and sell early"
11726,"Elon musk wanted to say this is people’s currency, but people thinks and acts like this is Elon’s coin.
I think people have to give value to dogecoin not Elon Musk. Even if the price was on $1 or even more, it would’ve crash even bigger because it’s value built on Elon’s popularity not the actual coin. However Now if the price of the dogecoin goes up to $1 or $10, it won’t be because of Elon and it won’t crash.
I think Elon Musk did what he had to do on his end."

11738,"Dogecoin is the penny stock of crypto currency. It’s a shot term gamble and is vulnerable to manipulation due to its high ownership concentration in small number of accounts. Bitcoin has been doing great but, IMHO, 100% of its growth is due to speculative trading. Of course, this has been true since its inception and people have made $millions. 

ETH is the least speculative big name cryptocurrency. It’s use in smart contracts gives it a practical purpose and it seems likely to gain traction as people find new and creative ways to leverage the Etherium ecosystem. 

Having said this, most of ETH’s value (at the moment) is based on pure speculation, so there is very little correlation right now between its use/utility and its price.

It’s fun playing around with cryptocurrency but low cost commodities like silver, copper, etc. are much better choices for shielding your money from the monster levels of inflation that are almost certainly in our near future. Downside is that there is no realistic chance of exponential growth in their respective spot prices."
11739,bonfireeeeee !!!!!!!!!! 2x in 48 hours!
11740,It's retarded to buy BTC at this moment. It showed how weak it was to crash. It's overpriced. It's alt coin season. XRP is gonna explode after it beats the case. CAD already rising like hell along with ETH. It's not Bitcoin season by any fucking means.
11741,People are still going to try push dodgecoin to a 1 dollar. The whole goal was just to get a dollar and that never happened.
11742,Doge is for noobs.

11747,"Elon owns btc , that s why he wants you to buy btc"
11748,"Why did Dogecoin tank after Elon Musk SNL comment about Dogecoin?
Because he was misunderstood!
He commented that Dogecoin was a ""Hustle"". Many were confused about his comment and took it the wrong way.
Here's my analysis.
Hustle Definition:
THE WRONG DEFINITION:
INFORMAL•NORTH AMERICAN
a fraud or swindle.
where it was obvious that he meant,
THE CORRECT DEFINITION:
busy movement and activity.
""Dogecoin hustles its way Moon bound""
Hasn't the dogecoin been seriously been busy with activity?
With the same breath Elon Must also said, ""Dogecoin is the cryptocurrency that will take over the world"" and ""to the moon"""
11749,Dodge coin 6 dollars on 2022 we all gonna see it $$$$$$$$$$$
11750,I lost 28 usdt doge coin 😓
11751,"Elon was like, ""Nobody is making money today"". Which pretty much makes him an asshole. :)"
11752,*WAIT!  A HUSTLE IS SLANG FOR A WAY TO MAKE MONEY.*  MICHAEL CHE IS FROM NYC.  When someone asks you what your hustle is they are asking you what your job or way to make money is.  That's why Elon said it's a way to make money and Che said oh it's a hustle.  Then Elon said confirmed.  People unfamiliar with the slang think they called it a scam when they were saying the exact opposite!

11888,"Wild theory here...

I think it’s possible the hedgies may be behind this, relating to GME and AMC. 

Seems possible Elon sold out for whatever reason; he helped pump Doge coin and then helped dump.  Incentive could be to finally get HFs to back off Tesla, as well as protect other investments he may have that could crash i the event of a squeeze (HF need to massively sell other longs to cover meme shorts)

If this is the case, would be very sweet indeed for HF’s- robbing retail to cover short call on other meme stocks. 

A lot of money could have been made going long over the past few months and then shorting last night, considering the massive whales described on this video it is very possible. 

Anyway, clearly speculation here, but if GME and AMC squeeze this week, I think it’s a good shout. 

Keep an eye on legacy next week."

11980,Should I hold doge?
11981,Elon musk is not going to mention Doge for a very very long time mates take out all ur money and put it into a meaningful serious projects ( other Cryptos)
11982,You told everyone to buy and load up.  You pumped it up.   What exactly as predicted r u  talking about.
11983,Why are you doge fans listening to a guy who just got in crypto and doesn't have much clue about the industry. All of you are purely into doge for speculation and gains and not for the value proposition and technology. We're talking real money being invested in a joke crypto with no utility and no development and massive inflation. Be careful everyone.
11984,This guys a hater...
11985,"Shiba Inu is early dodge with limited supply , currently up 500%"

11990,Fuck that. Keeping my Dogecoin. Screw Bitcoin😂😂
11991,bonfire good project with a lot of new hodlers and making gains. think it will follow a price increase like doge and safemoon.
11992,"Safemoon is the real future, if ykyk."
11993,Elon literally called it the currency of the future. Get in or be left behind.
11994,Doge is trash and going to kill the industry if these idiots don’t stop
11995,"Another typical Doge hater and a Bitcoin pumper. You can’t admit BTC just hit its limit, it didn’t budge since February whereas Dogecoin multiplied X15. Doge To the moon now people 🚀🐕💪😎"

12005,"Elon is so into dogecoin, but the mom’s script killed it. Might be the reason it crashed. Should have said “i wished its a dogecoin” instead"
12006,But dude elon then said Doge to the Moooon. Anyways doge will go $1 in a week mark mu words
12007,It didn’t dump that much. Buy the dip
12008,I have sell my dogecoin  & lost around 2500rs🥲 i am a student & every  time i have bad luck
12009,Sir what is your timeframe ( months/yrs) for Doge to reach $30 - $ 50
12010,Ohh Johny sins😜
12011,You are clearly just a YouTube guy who knows not much about crypto .Bye .Unsubscribing .
12012,"Guys, checkout the pump & volume of new (24hrs) coin. SHIBAPUP.

Good channel, bro"
12013,People hype it up before the event and it skyrockets then they tank it the day of the event then buy it back.
12014,"There was only 2 likely scenarios. The less likely scenario: it would hold at it's new high and consolidate for a while, or the more likely scenario: come back down to it's average. I called what would likely play out over a week ago. Dogecoin would get to about $0.67 to $0.76, ($0.85 at the most) and then likely come back down to $0.50 to $0.60 and consolidate therefor a while. I encourage everyone to zoom the graph out to see the bigger picture. You are not going to see anything looking at the daily graph. On a year timescale, you will see after Dogecoin got above $0.05, it met a resistance point at $0.10. It consolidated between $0.05 and $0.08 that lasted about 2 months, that is likely to repeat itself now before it breaks $1.00. It likely won't break and average over $1 until mid August to early September. So there is no reason to panic and sell, in fact, Dogecoin is still above it's average now, even after the crash. Dogecoin should only be around $0.49 right now as of writing this. $0.0125 * ((85% + (-45%) + 128%) / 3) * 128.95 = $0.49001

Remember, you haven't truly lost until you sell under your purchase price.."

Proof of Work is inefficient, not scalable & fraught with security problems! Pure insanity & stupidity! Totally hack-able with 51%+ control of miners attack 😱 forking here, forking there for selfish profits, it’s totally centralised by a couple of Chinese miners, no utility, no use case, no value beyond perceived 🥴 it’s dying a slow death 💀 but surely it is dying, soon to be replaced by 👑XRP👑 which really does have true utility, use cases, scalable, instant settlement, ultra fast, ultra secure, very cheap, very Ecco friendly, has a serious & real team of developers, a marketing team & a realistic plan for the future 💰❌💰"

12107,"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crpto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Prof Thompson program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.Thompson can be reached

12146,Hi bro Gm
12147,"Since the last week of March, Mon;ero has seen exponential growth. A low of $204 seen during March 25 and a high of $438 a week ago represented gains of over 110% and for the last few sessions, the rally was kept at bay under the $440-mark and some bearishness was noted in the market. According to Awesome Oscillator’s red bars, momentum was on the bearish side, but the hourly timeframe did see a positive switch up. A strong region of support lay at $388 and maintain this would allow for a breakout above $440. Meanwhile, ADX rested at 15 and highlighted a weak trend. The 24-hour trading volumes jumped by 40% in the last 24-hours but were yet to touch $1 Billion. Expect some sideways movement before the volumes jump further because the v0latility nature of the crpytO asset is a plus for trαders because it's good for trαdiing and if trαdes are placed correctly that's constant profits which in turn increases your portfolio, which is why I copy trade with Burwell Coleman because his trαde signals are the most accurate and I have been making 6btc every month for the last eight months in a row. His on ահαեsαթթ (+44 7723 022159) and Gm@il (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom). Burwell is so good that I can attest to the accuracy of his trαde s!gnαls which is why I would recommend him for any trαder looking to stay profitable."

We’ve no doubt in mind that we are not only going bull with little signs of stopping.

Or am I missing something? Nowadays more alts have more volume on USD markets, but especially back in 2017 most of them had most of their volume in BTC markets, maybe this cycle alts will be slightly less correlated to BTC than in 2017?

Over the last 24 hours, B'C'H was up by 3%, but weekly gains stood strong at 160%. This also suggested a correctional period for E'T'C before it resumed its upwards trajectory. If $111 support is maintained, another hike can be anticipated in the coming days. If that level is breached by the sellers, pullbacks around $90, $70.5 were also possible. An extreme sell-off could go as low as $45.5 and below the 20-SMA. The width of Bollinger Bands indicated high volatility in the m@rket and backed a pullback after it tr@ded on the upper band. The RSI made its second peak in the overbought zone and headed downwards.  There is no better time to stack up on your crypt0 @ssets, there are two approaches to incre@sing your @sset as an !nvestor first is by buying little bits of crypt0 subsequently and the second which is a preferred and better option is tradlng because it is less cap!tal intensive and more prof!table.

12399,"Schönes Update. Zu Beginn der Handelssitzung dieser Woche wechselt der neutrale Wochenausblick zwischen Verlusten und Gewinnen, was es für Anleger schwierig macht, zu entscheiden, wie der aktuelle Markt am besten genutzt werden soll. Für mich kann es nicht offensichtlicher sein, dass der Handel mit Bitcoin viel lukrativer ist, als nur zu hetzen und darauf zu warten, dass der Preis für Bitcoin in die Höhe schnellen kann. Ich dachte nicht, dass es möglich wäre, durch den Handel einen konstanten Gewinn zu erzielen, bis ich auf das Anthony Perez-Programm für Investoren / Neulinge stieß, die nicht verstehen, wie der Handel mit Bitcoin funktioniert, um ihnen dabei zu helfen, Verluste nach dem Absturz auszugleichen und seitdem auch mehr Bitcoin zu stapeln Ende letzten Jahres bis heute habe ich mit Hilfe von Anthony über 19 BTC von 2,6 Btc gemacht.

12415,"I was new in the cryptocurrency world and I had actually spent a great deal of time taking a look at some online videos and  information that would give me more insight to be more productive with my cryptocurrency. Richard baker was advised by my friend who has actually enjoyed trading for many years. She informed me to first attempt the demo trade mode to get more understanding about the automobile trading system. I chose to try it due to the reality that I got curious, I'm glad I gave it a shot at Richard. In 3 weeks, Richard helped me turn my trade from 1.5 bitcoin to 4 bitcoin. For both beginners and experts,  this Richard baker is without a doubt the very best in the business! I would encourage anyone who is interested in learning how to trade, make maximum profit and HODL less to reach out to Richard Baker on Tҽʅ-ҽ-qɾαɱ. -- Richardbaker01"

12432,"Most people don’t know that vechain has an exchange token called oceanex (oce) it’s under the radar with only 7B total supply at $0.01

Buy on oceanex or bittrue!"
12433,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI. His daily trade s!gnals has really helped me grow my !nvestment in the crypt0 m@rket and with the right mentorship and str@tegy, crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for newbies and lnvestor. Burwell is also an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist and you can find his courses on tradlng on the internet for free and they come in handy as an !nvestor and he can be reached on gmαil (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom) and Եҽlҽցɾαต   (@burwellcoleman) for his assistance on crypt0 related enquires."

12500,"From the look of things and according to experts in the crypto space. This period the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals, this i have been doing with Mr Joseph Robinson's  daily signals which has been so accurate and well profitable, Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 6.8btc with my initial 3.2btc which you would agree is a very good profits. I see no reason to panic when you can build your portfolio with Joseph Robinson's daily signals and guides, Joseph can be reached on  and Telegram @josephrobinsoncrypto for inquiries into profitable trading systems."
12501,Dogecoin goes back to 17 cents.....😂

12509,"Whales did not decide to sell Simply Barry Silverd and his team was shorting badly They have an access to large amount of crypto
However I guess just my guess in 50 cents level some whales did buy a large amount of doge just in order to prevent a catastrophic drop
SNL reminds me Tesla battery day Tesla dropped so heavy almost catastrophic drop 
I remember very shy Musk explained about new battery technology Why he is so shy when he is speaking in public ?!

Shyness is bad thing I don’t now how he did succeed In his life but some people did not get shy people 
Second thing Mark Cubain is much much better catalyst to doge them Elon Musk in my opinion"

12635,So the question is who owns those accounts who bought millions and billions of doge  ??
12636,"I was watching YouTube video until i came across ms Jane investment platform then I said it all scam, but after my investment with ms Jane investment platform, my life changed i just bought a new car from my increased."
12637,So someone gets out then someone buys in then they get out and someone gets in it’s a scam
12638,I was about to block this channel bc of ya thumbnail showing doge at 1.89
12639,SPREAD THE WORD.  THE PRICE CRASHED AS SOON AS HE ENTERED THE STAGE.  IT WAS A STAGED CRASH BY THE WHALES. THE FIRST TIME HE SAID THE WORD DOGE THE PRICE PLUMMETTED AGAIN (opening skit).  WaKe Up
12640,"Almost panic sold half my Dogecoin s yesterday when it was sinking, so glad Robin Hood was backed up and was able to cancel order..this morning didn’t look pretty, but so happy to see it stabilize and start going back up."
12641,Elon basically said it’s a hustle coin meaning pump n dump.
12642,"Bought the dip & took a nap. Sorry to see so much panic over this lol. If you're scared, buy silver, ammo & drugs."
12643,When I seen that big dip I knew it was the account who’s been making huge plays all week (same account that did the 50m Bitcoin play earlier this week).IMO I think Elon meant it was a hustle as a good thing and not bad.the old investors that bash doge and crypto in general took it as a chance to scare the small time investors like they do with stocks.I see Bloomberg do this tactic daily on stocks and now the crypto market smh

12652,I haven’t even watched the video but I’m going to assume you didn’t mention the news today of SpaceX GSC and Doge-1Mission. If so do your own DD and check it out.  Doge has been solidified as a unit of account for lunar business in the space sector as of today. The mission will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation of interplanetary commerce” said SpaceX Vice-President.  “We’re excited to launch DOGE-1 to the Moon!”

12671,"BTC is the future of crypt0 and the question traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest? before jumping to a conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. you can't tell if it is going to be high or low. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 6.7BTC in just two weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by Prof. Freddy A.T. his methods are top-notch and profitable. give it a try guys. Prof. Fred has a telegram channel @cryptoprofreddy where he provides daily signals for all members, also you can also be part of ETH or any other cryptocurrency earning chain with his guides"
12672,Could you share here the website to check it? the sales and buys? thanks in advance!
12673,"In my opinion, Dogecoin grows up so aggressively before the SNL show is because people are so excited when Elon Musk mentioned about Dogecoin  with his tweet and responsive.
But when after the show, the price low down, to be honest actually that is normal to any crypto currency or businesses, people will take an advatage to take profit when they have the chances, whoever they are either a whale or just a kitty fish. But what my point is, Doincoin is  still on going, up and down as should be. 

So, dont be panic or fomo. If you believed Dogecoin and you know what do you want and what is your expectation either on long run or just playing around then that is because you choose it not because of Elon Musk or whoever, Is it make a sense? 

So take it easy guys… lf you decided to stay, then Buy now. This is the perfect time to buy more and sell when the price is high or HOLD it if you choose for a long run.

Knowledge is Power. The more your know, the less your fear…xoxo"
12674,How do I view the whales
12675,"Elon either deleted that tweet or someone faked it, because it isn't on his twitter anymore"
12676,"THESE DAYS IF YOU'RE NOT SPENDING TO RECOVER,THEN STOP SPENDING 💰"
12677,I wonder if that whale who is buying was Elon?  I can see a savvy investor like him waiting for people with the ability to tank his investment to sell off before he puts a large amount of money in. And if it’s not a financial investment in the form of a Doge purchase he’s doing; I can totally see him wanting a crypto to have a more even distribution of its coins before he begins accepting it as payment. What good is taking it as currency if the only people that have enough to buy anything are a small handful of people while the rest of us might only be able to buy a couple of dollars worth of product?
12678,Mrs Lisa is legit and her method works like magic I keep onf earning every single week with her new strategy
12679,Hello Friends. Just now I have seen one tweet on spacex about Dogecoin which related. Plz have a look and update us on ur channel.
12680,"If they bought a billion worth doge then why didn't the value go up ?
I understand your support towards the coin but in reality has doge done any good ? Any projects anything which we can trust? Whales are going to buy n sell but people like us will never get what we want."

12709,Doge to $1 tonite 100%
12710,Its at 55 cent right now this morning it was 40
12711,"Bro . The fundamentals of   doge is weak . All these talks of so called backers are purely speculative. We have to remember that there is no cap of supply for doge in comparison to other cryptos like bitcoin and ether . So it’s only a hustle . Further , if a coin depends entirely on a single person then it do not have any future as we witnessed today . When elon said it’s a hustle, the value plummeted . Feel very sorry for the retail investors."
12712,"you are wrong aswell. dogecoin already crashed when elon and his mom talked about her motherday present dogecoin (which she didnt want) thats when it crashed. her words ""i am excited for my mothersday gift, i just hope its not dogecoin"""
12713,"My lessons learnt: Buy the dip, never the hype --- buy the rumor, sell the news. And be patient, don't be emotional on trading. This was a great lessons for me, now time to wait."
12714,"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crpto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Prof James program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.

12743,Doge is rising rn
12744,"Buy the hype, sell the news! It didn't matter what Elon said. People with massive Doge holdings bet against Doge and dumped as soon as he mentioned it. They made money by selling it and by shorting it in the derivatives exchange. And they kept the price down all night to ensure they'd win their short."

12780,"I see you are very NEW in the market. I would expect one to be educated in finance, markets and etc although watching your videos I feel under the impression that your are very unsure about any of this. My question is, why would someone buy a crypto when theres hardly places that except the coin or on certain cryptos?!?! In theory, the ""1"" currency that can be utilized for purchases in major locations, supply stores and these physical locations that do NOT except cryptos of any ""as bitcoin is useless in almost every location that isnt buying something off line or darknet the whatnot and even so, many locations globally only use bitcoin in location seldomly or 1 out 100 locations that except bitcoin. How do you find any other crypto other than bitcoin of any value? Someday in the next few decades the crypto could be used in more locations I get this although in the real world of wallstreet no one really seems all this interested as that we can simply buy crypto at the time it would be usable in many locations although it may not even be of strong value even then. Are you willing to risk it all on a concept currency? I own and operate a private equities firm in Des Moines Iowa the services we provide to the public funds the house and for over a decade in my company we have not seen any strong value in crypto as the supply and demand for such currency has never presented itself a true value at all. So why do you invest in crypto?"

12865,"I like how they skimmed over the inflation schedule for doge, they DO NOT want to talk about how the amount allowed to be mined gets cut every year, never goes to 0 but it will get down to .0000000000000001 and even more 0’s over time, which is basically like capping it. Where a cap limit goes bad is if all institutions hold all the btc. Doge dodges that by allowing more to be mined, mind you that it will get get real scarce."
12866,"Bought in under penny, only been buying dips to help fight the plunge, average is .18 now. Not scared to buy dips"
12867,"Amazon prime page has a gold dog in a box on the enrollment page. However , I went to buy shiba coin and on the last page there is an Amazon add . Any thoughts ? Thank you for your channel btw 😁"
12868,"I’m still holding. I cash in my initial investment, and now I’m letting it sit and trading around some more."
12869,You seem like a nice guy. I liked your video! 👀
12870,Have you guys heard of Safemoon? I think it has HUUUGE potential!
12871,"Problem with the playing with the house money notion is that unless you had bought doge over a year ago, damn Biden and his trolls are looking to make us pay a lot of taxes on this."
12872,If you type Amazon Day in the Amazon search bar on the app you’ll see the Doge  pup. 😊
12873,"I didn’t sleep last night, i have a full time job 8:30-5:30p and i spent all night watching and waiting for the dip and opportunity to buy lol. i love my job but i just want financial freedom at this point. and Doge is going to be the answer haha.. i never did crypto before and i’m trying to buy more shares.... and leave it for 10 years and forget my password, then I’ll just be surprised to wake up one day and already a millionaire lmao Dream Big Y’all! 🤣💰🔥"
12874,Since it's unlimited it can have some value but never the value of Bitcoin or ethereum
12875,Good stuff!
12876,Can you talk about bonfire? i heard it has a lot of potential
12877,"DOGE WILL BE THE WORLD'S DIGITAL CRYPTOCURRANCY PEOPLE FAVORITE  TARGET  1

12878,"What would you recommend for ppl who got late in the game and bought 🐕 for 0.60-0.62 last week and want to long term but are on a loss? Buy more during dips to lower average  and hold or just wait?
Thank you."

12889,Doge is going to change peoples life! Invest people b4 its to late!
12890,honestly I think Elon is doing more harm to Doge now
12891,"I love that you love doge coin, But we was less than 1.5b from Bianance coin at the High. We had 92.4b they had 94.1b. Not the 10b away like you said. Other than that good video."

12894,"Was trying to start my first crypto account in the beginning of this year and wanted to buy in on Doge.. 
But website was doing weird things and wasn't able to verify my account. At the time I was planning my wedding so I put it aside for the time being....
Would have been able to pay for my entire wedding from only the wins of the last few months🙄.

But still jumped on the doge train last week. Let's take it to the mooon!"

12903,Dogecoin to the moonnnn
12904,"I'm Holding 10k Doge at .23 cents. I'm still up and will wait till the years end before I think to sell. I'm hoping by the years end we should be at 1$ or hovering around it. This is my first investment, so I'm happy I held and didn't sell, should be worth it long term!"
12905,"Concern is only 10 to 12 account holds 50 percent of the coin and out of which 1 acount has whooping 29% percent of whole doge..
So it might just go everything to nothing at any moment 😭"
12906,"People, Dogecoin has a huge army that is not visible ""yet"", but in the near future I have faith that very many will bite fingers of remorse because they have not jumped inside the Dogecoin ship."
12907,My entry is at 69 cent 🤦🏾‍♂️😭 I don't know what to do I'm really a stupid....

12963,"Literally told everyone ""wait till after Saturday to buy. Buy the dip"" cuz hype leads to a dip. This is normal."
12964,It fell because it was shorted
12965,take this clip down bro... your are all over the place with your analysis which 3 days later shows that there is no bleed out... some new timers panaic sold when they saw the whales sell... but that's about it... mostly the price is keeping up around .50 which is great ready for the next leap beyond the moon
12966,Elon Musk just needs to stop talking about crypto currencies Period!
12967,Labra finance coin is going to the moon🚀🚀
12968,Any exposure is good exposure ...
12969,The skids sucked big time!  Elon was boxed and stereotyped as the nerd.
12970,Robinhood is controlled. It's not a free market. It's manipulation.
12971,Why is there so much spam in your comment section?
12972,Fuck dogecoin and it’s investors
12973,At the very least I’m happy you (Kevin) are losing money. You made lots of people lose money by your recommendations that karma will take care of you
12974,Someone is contacting your subscribers with a duplicate channel of yours
12975,So robinhood saved us?
12976,I make a lot of money investing in the cryptocurrency market as a single mom. It's very profitable with the help of a seasoned broker trading on your behalf 😊😊
12977,I can't believe SNL is still on the air.
12978,"Diamond hands baby, idk. also not a/your finical advisor."
12979,"Why you tripping? You’re making people panic selling and you’re part of the problem. Credibility lost. Hands made of kleenex, not even paper."
12980,WHY ISN'T THE DOW AT 5000 ???
12981,"If you noticed though, Elon Musk said to “be careful and tread lightly with Doge” his advice!! I don’t know 🤷‍♀️ just saying.."
12982,"$Happy it an awesome coin, it is mooning right now, you should check it out... I personally am not in only for the profits but also for mental health aspect of it.... It has donations every friday. The lead dev is very cool chad Sawyer. Of course DYOR !"
12983,"Fundamental analysis of an ""asset"" with zero intrinsic value..."
12984,Bloody wanker
12985,charity tokens the next big thing. HAPPY COIN mooning as i type this
12986,Shiba !!!! 🚀
12987,"Let’s go guys dogecoin is cool, BUT let’s get rich with SHIBA COIN. Let’s buySHIBA COIN and hold to the moon 🌙"
12988,I mean it's the same idea as asking football quarterback where he is doing after the superbowl. They pay to make get them to promote it.
12989,$Happycoin 🤗🤗🤗
12990,Don't know why you expected much more from SNL
12991,SNL is trash. Had been for awhile
12992,"SELL DOGE, BUY $SHIB"
12993,Elon pumped Doge to historical levels and expect people to not lose money?
12994,"Best #altcoin at the moment is hands down $HAPPY
This crypto gives tens of thousands to charity every week, has a doxxed founder, communicative dev team and just a great community. This is not a pump and dump, but a long-term hold that will grow exponentially while helping those in need. 
Love it ❤️🚀❤️"
12995,"Check out happycoin! They donate weekly to mental health and already have over $700k in the charity wallet! 90k donated in 3 weeks, certik audit passed, coingecko listing, white jt listing, cmc listing coming any day now. It’s only 20 days old! Really excited to see where this goes!! :)"
12996,"At the end of the day if Elon is accepting its as a reputable means of payment.. that says it all.
Other Companies follow suit and the wheel turns."
12997,Bitcoin is the future investing in it now is the wisest thing to do now especially with Hackbyxion on IG in this current rise
12998,"The rich see’s economy crisis as a garage sale, that why investing with Hackbyxion on !G we be the best decision"
12999,Your support and encouragement have always been the driving factor in my life. Thank you so much Hackbyxion on !!G
13000,"I’ll never forget the great effort of Hackbyxion on !G for keeping us to his promise,he’s such a genius."
13001,"Ever since I came across Mr Thomas, Bitcoin Trading my bad history turned  out to be the best investment"
13002,"Uniswap is a horrible coint, the swapping fee is also 💩 start selling and buy (PIG finance token) 300% up! Binance low fee (Pancakeswap)"
13003,"He said it’s a scam...
BecUse it is you morons"
13004,Elon does not give an F if people lose their ass he is just covering his own.
13005,Is this guy actually talking about market fluctuations of dodge in a serious manner? he knows dodge is a joke right?
13006,"In January I had doge I bought at .07. It dropped to .03 and I panic sold when I should’ve bought the dip. I lost $. 
I learned the hard way. If I held it it would have made me 10,000 in just 4 short months"
13007,"The risk really comes when you ask the question.... do doge investors know the fundamentals of a ""joke"" crypto token."
13008,To the 🌙... Dogecoin on Coinbase
13009,SNL hasn't been funny for 40 years maybe 50
13010,Sell that shit ASAP
13011,SHIBA!
13012,Elon was hilarious - had no idea he was that funny.
13013,"I don't think the SNL skit had any impact on Doge.  CNBC, Bloomberg, etc., have been saying for weeks that the hedges are going to sell during the skit.  It's been openly talked about for weeks, since Elon was announced as a host.  The hedges ran it up and now they're running it down.  Exactly when they said they would."
13014,The HAPPY coin gained 20 million USD in market cap in less than 24 hours ❤️!
13015,Kevin has COVID perhaps
13016,I think ppl are so crazy that another whale hyping Doge will drive it up to a dollar one day
13017,"I believe the word you were looking for was to ""anticipate."" Thank you for post."
13018,SNL had been boring for almost 20 years now
13019,Dumb ass XRP steller ada cardano spark these are all better then you're dog coin or bitcon you make people buy
13020,"He shouldn’t been on the show...Kevin, you are a little high strung. Relax..."
13021,Watching this after I panic sold*
13022,I traded my dogecoin for Shiba inu Elon tweet about it he said searching for a new Shiba pup
13023,I love your transparency & realness!!! Seriously!!! And your intelligence!!! 🥰
13024,Robinhood? Use Webull
13025,"We have a problem with Doge you said! Aside from the fact that has no value, except for the value assigned by herd pump and dump investment, I agree we have a problem...😹😹😂"
13026,If a crypto is going mainstream it is doge. We just need a mil tps update
13027,Dogecoin is a joke though...
13028,"After months of you persuading people to buy doge coins and crypto, now you are trying to show you care that these dumb people will lose their money. Man you really are a deuche bag Kevin."
13029,"1 correction there man, Elon Musk doesn't give 2 flying fucks about you..."
13030,"DOGE is the butt of every joke! 

Are you staying at a motel? Place looks like a dump. Hahaha…"
13031,Investing make up the top notch hemisphere of the wealth. That’s the more reason one should save and invest to secure profit and ensure success

13034,"l recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get person who invested with her 
comment below"
13035,this is the first time I dislike one of your videos. not the best. I hope is the last
13036,🤣📈
13037,"Man, it looks like you smoked a fatty."
13038,"When Kevin makes Good News sound like Bad News. Stay low, consolidate, buy more during the pit stop before take-off. This is good, let everyone sell, we buy it back up and become the new millionaires...and the cycle starts again..."
13039,"Forget dogecoin.... DOGELON $ELON coin to Mars 🚀  it just came out 2 weeks ago and unlike dogecoin, it has a MAX supply"
13040,ACUTUALLY...its because musk is the antichrist...
13041,Thanks Elon!
13042,When your investment is dependending on a SNL sketch... you are doing something wrong...
13043,It truly is sad that people have lost the faith in a system and instead have fait in something they either do not understand or know is just a gamble
13044,Tesla down to zero by end of week!  Kevin balls deep on margin!  Michael burry won this lifetime lol
13045,"I thought the show was great! Elon did better than some actors! Elon didn’t stumble explaining Doge, that was part of the skit! FYI SNL skits are always scripted beforehand ."
13046,This guy has never heard buy the rumor sell the fact???? Everyone buys tickets before an event not after it starts you knuckle head
13047,I tried to sell my Dogecoin Saturday and Robinhood went down always at the most inopportune moments I know liquidated my Robinhood account there are no longer any more funds in Robinhood
13048,"the vast majority is snl cast members wanted to boycott Elon Musks appearance. Simply put; the most intolerant, prejudicial people in this country are Liberals"
13049,It will be fine. It's not going away. It will be $5 sometime in the future.
13050,How do you buy on webull. I can’t?
13051,"HOKAIDU INU IS THE NEXT SHIBA, AND WILL BE LISTED ON ZBG, WHITEBIT ETC, JUMP IN WHILE YOU CAN💥💥💥💥💥💥 HOKK HOKK HOKK HOKK"
13052,"DogeCoin is a total scam, and anyone that buys this made up crypto trash that is not used by anyone, needs to have a thorough mental checkup"
13053,I was disappointed as well. Elon has a better presence within his business than SNL.
13054,"""SNL just wasn't that funny""
Oh Kevin my sweet summer child, SNL has never been funny."
13055,You are all falling for the deception of doge 😂 invest in utility like XRP
13056,I believe the reason why the price is wrong and you’re not able to buy or sell instantly is because they have short sold you the doge.
13057,That was bad...bad doggy🥸
13058,Elon Musk is the seller of tulips.
13059,Snl is poorly done 95% of the time
13060,"During SNL when doge dropped fast , my GEMINI app completely froze up and I couldn’t buy nor sell. I couldn’t even see my portfolio. Shit is rigged"
13061,"You really need to boost the color saturation on your video thumbnails, they're all very dull and non-colorful."
13062,"dogecoin “kevin save me”

kevin “ im on the teacups «"
13063,Looking extra pasty
13064,"Let's be honest... Saturday Night Live is very liberal and they see Wall Street Bets as being very right-wing because their logo looks like Donald Trump, so of course they're going to trash all of these stocks using Elon Musk who is well respected in the community."
13065,Come on Kevin we all need money but this is toooo much commercials
13066,"I had one error on Robin Hood for buying , I was trying to go all in and I was rejected 2X. I took $3 off of the all in and it went through with no issues. It wouldn’t surprise me if there was an issue with their software + calculator on how it spits a penny to buy a doge and in the process the software crashes"
13067,A lot of people are going to lose lots of money on all of this monopoly money.
13068,I know nothing about crypto currency. Where do I start??
13069,"There is a interesting individual, who can be googled as ""Walter Bulls strategy"". He made a fortune some years ago. Not long ago, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of professionals. This guy clearly demonstrates how to copy him automatically using such services. We must try while the market is on the rise."
13070,"Elon Musk, is bullshit. The bubble guy."
13071,Plot twist: Kevin was shorting Doge.
13072,Ok so bring the ceo of robinhood on heee again and be kind and sweet and agree with him again?
13073,"eff doge! Its dumb. Gamestop is dumb too. Elon doesn't even care about his own stock, why would he care about doge? Its just a joke to him."
13074,Try nominex. It took me seconds to buy and sell
13075,Doge went to 7 cents?  Where the hell is he seeing that?
13076,Yeah man you just lost a subscriber
13077,Aka penny stocks aka high risk
13078,"There is no such liquidity’s issue on the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges. I would guess that there servers are just overloaded, because I can swears you can fill a market order instantly on the right exchanges. I wouldn’t buy/sell crypto through weeble/Robinhood because they rely on this leader exchanges behind the scene.

About doge: one account own 28% of the supply and this account is definitively active, and withdraw around 2B last month (you can check the blockchain records :) )."
13079,Dudes drinkin lol
13080,SNL was the event and the news. Look at how much exposure it is getting. When in doubt zoom out. Dog to $5 by July.
13081,"I thought Elon did fine, we were pretty lucky he even mentioned it at all. The true problem was that robinhood owns 25% of all the doge coin available to trade. After the GameStop saga robinhood is trying to get some of their money back. It makes sense that they used that 25% to sell at the peak to make some of that money back. They can literally drop or pump the price for 25% of its CMV"
13082,dont listen to anyone not even Kevin! (no offense man :D) listen to yourself.
13083,Harmony looks like a very good project to talk about is made by one of the shift engineers from google maps and he has a very good team Very very Good crypto to look for ... technology and fast
13084,Lots of people are going to  get hurt when Doge crashes...Dont vote for this guy
13085,breh. too shiny. hurt eyes.
13086,That this guy has gone from real estate the most tangible asset in the world to this nonsense is a good statement on the bubble we are in ...kevinsanity
13087,Dogecoin going to $1+ 🚀
13088,Elon did great! N I thought it was really funny.
13089,Mad TV was always better than SNL and gas powered cars are more practical. (Clearly in my feelings)
13090,"I'm done with DOGE, ETH is where its at."
13091,Kevin talk about the AMC movement that’s going on right now
13092,"Future self tells past Kevin, HODL everything! The very next day Elon announces Doge-1 rocket to the moon being financed by $Dogecoin"
13093,Do you own any doge personally Kev??
13094,DOGE 💯📈🚀
13095,Yall mad at a coins price dropping as if its core value being based on one person is a good thing
13096,"Saying ""what's up with Doge"" is like saying what's up with the dice but you're playing with a 12 sided 🎲... And #SNL was funny as hell. For first time in a long time."
13097,Bonfire 🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
13098,Not even Elon could save that show. SNL is just terrible...
13099,currently market cap and potential of DOGE is set up to 10 dollars... its realistic that it can move up to 1 within this year.
13100,"If jokes on SNL are enough to cause your investment to lose its quarter of its value in a matter of minutes, maybe you're not in the best investment... just saying."
13101,"its not the day we think it is... snl is not a good catylist because its all SNLS FAULT... now SNL needs to be sued for causing harm to doge...  THats where the money is... or if we wait, DOGE is going up to 80 and also evenutally within this year to 1 dollar."
13102,Do any of you know any videos to recommend?  Been watching this jackass 3 months and he never made me any money.
13103,"Who cares, ETH just broke 4K"
13104,"Dduuddee. I doubt you’ll lose any followers by enjoying a weekend with your family. Time is the only thing you can’t get back. Also, we aren’t promised tomorrow so why not spend time with those you love?"
13105,"Ha, some are luvin the volatility created by the SNL tension- many bought at the dip last night and got some nice scalps."
13106,you watched snl?  on purpose?
13107,"Next DOGE 
$ BONFIRE . Buy it, before you missed the rocket, 2 days on coinmarket. Get in early and make $$$$$
🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
13108,"A scam was running on YouTube and Twitter before and at the same time as SNL. Just Google, SNL DOGE scam the word is a lot of people sold a lot of DOGE and lost a lot of money."
13109,Elan Musk bought the episode??
13110,"Get back to stimulus and pandemic 
I’m not interested if you Governor 
Or stocks
I’m going to unsubscribe soon"
13111,This my first time seeing kevin slapped 😂
13112,You cant actually own the crypto since you cane use a wallet feature to move your coins. I wouldn't recommend robin hood or webull for crypto.
13113,Why does it feel like everyone is always on the doom and gloom side of Dogecoin at every opportunity? The coin dropped to 14 cents and then shot up to an all time high of 70+ cents and now it's holding strong in the 50's. The thing is a beast and is doing incredible.
13114,$LXXGF is not a momentum stock but it will be.  You saw it here first.
13115,Hello again KEVIN 🍓Did Musk Pump & Dump this Doge Shit for his Own Account? We may never Know🤗👻

13119,"All my buddies at work were bragging about their dogecoin gains. I decided to teach them a lesson and bought some at 68 cents on Friday, hehe. I'm going to keep holding to really twist the knife.

That showed them how smart they are. You can also tell when I just bought some tech stocks because the Nasdaq will drop 1+% the next day."
13120,Hello again Compadre KEVIN🍓Remember Robinhood is a Terrible Service. No Telephone number to Call. No Fuck'n Good & Robbing Novice Investors. They Really Need to be Shutdown or Regulated🤗👻

13129,IPOE IS ABOUT TO POP.
13130,"Can you please do an informational video over SafeMoon? Is has more people on its CMC watchlist than Bitcoin, almost 2 million holders in 60 days, was the most viewed crypto for around 2 weeks straight (still top 2 - 3) making their own wallet and exchange etc.. its starting to become a legitimate crypto."
13131,"you stupid quacks think that Webull and Robinhood is **THE** place to buy Crypto at all let alone DGOE..... 

No it doesnt deserve the respect to have the Ticker spelled correctly lol. Stop BS ing learn the damn crypto space and get your millions in 2030. Or forever be a ""I used to have that one"""

13140,"@meetkevin Checkout Nano coin! Feeless, Instant, inflation proof and energy friendly. Its the future of payment"
13141,This guy should run for Governor or something
13142,He cashed out his doge and took a vaca 😂y’all slow af
13143,"I agree with your point of view.... But I like how it went. It holds him unaccountable for leading a novice astray. However, it created an opportunity to still buy low. So I think it played out well. But Thats just my 5c. Thanks for your streams. Good stuff."
13144,"He announced that space X is going to accept payments for lunar project on beginning of next year...  So I thing that's why he shouted ,, Dogecoin to the moon,, :)"
13145,"If I had known SNL did not have a good skit for Elan to deploy his comments on Dogecoin, I would have personally driven to set and wrote the funniest most rememberable skit for crypto  Very dissappointed"
13146,Who would make an investment where the catalyst is a skit on SNL?
13147,Speaking of Enphase...we still need a fundamental analysis on Enphase!
13148,"Come on Kevin, Elon musk is naming one of his spaceships DOGE 1!"
13149,"just seen you on CNBC Make It, killin it man"
13150,Coming soon: Doge One! He is naming one of his spaceships “Doge One” and it will literally go to the moon and to Mars!
13151,"Elon musk is the richest man, I don't know who needs to hear this, you've got stop saving money, invest some part of it, if you want financial freedom."
13152,"Thanks  Kevin, You have my vote and I'm not really a voter type. You're a star. Rockin it."
13153,Leaning back further and further 🤣
13154,"I got errors on robin hood trying to buy, wanted to catch that falling knife and my order was not processed. Also Webull kept freezing on us."
13155,You know people are just going to buy the dip. The rally will continue until the hedge funds shut it down.
13156,When you start to think critically about currency not backed by a sovereign nation. It's starts to fall apart.
13157,"Maybe the horders of doge sold as Elon referred in February , the concentration on doge stock holders should sell ."
13158,"Kevin, put the camera down and be on vacation. (In my Lauren’s voice). 😆"
13159,Is it time to do it Doge style?
13160,"go for DOGET doge token, still trading at 0.01 on stellar port, its better than doge coin cause the max supply is 10 billion. it wil be the next doge coin"
13161,Kev for gov
13162,You look look 10 years older with this camera. 🤔
13163,"If you're investing your life savings in Dogecoin, you need a new life."
13164,"Shiney face or not, nice to get real talk! Thank you!"

13167,Does anyone think aapl share price will drop after this weeks CPI data? It doesn’t seem like it’s really affected Apple this far. I’m looking to buy some shares.
13168,Get out whlie you're not hurting that bad
13169,"I sold and bought the dip at .42, made a f***ing killing sitting at .58 learned that move from Runescape G.E 🐶🚀🌚  📈💰💰💰💰💰"
13170,Just use Binance for your crypto trading ffs
13171,Everyone's a critic. Anyone seriously thought Doge is not gonna dip? C'mon.
13172,Maintain 69. Got it. Thanks
13173,Hoping an auto makers ceo mentions a joke coin on a comedy show shouldn't be an investment strategy?
13174,People like you are blowing  this shit out of proportion and trying to make shit out of thin air. And you want to run for governor?! Geez!! This country is going crazy!!
13175,"Twitter didn’t help any with certain people, *Barry*, making comments like he did earlier Saturday."
13176,The stock markets are a scam .
13177,Let’s kick it!
13178,Ummmm....I thought you were taking a weekend off :-)
13179,oooooooor invest in a crypto that ACTUALLY does something!!!!!?   Cardano will run countries and states in 5 years...Doge will be a funny story over a beer in a bar 5 years from now.
13180,"Elon should've walked out open monologs with 5 mini puppy doge leashed dogs scampering, and then a Kyle Mooney ""I'm pumping doge!"" Dogepumper skit, those were my two ideas I shared on webull.  people go apeshit puppies."
13181,13min video= 10 ads in the video
13182,"“here we go, come on push it, buyin the dip” Kevin"
13183,"Anyone expecting scripts to be “good” on SNL was expecting a miracle. However, they were extraordinarily bad last night. That Yoda thing? Good grief."
13184,Thanks Kevin. Fake Loser Kev don't bother spamming me.
13185,Sorry - I didn’t watch your whole video as I had to stop. Too painful. SNL was fabulous - I can’t help it if you don’t know for example the Chad character. I couldn’t breathe I was laughing so hard. You might want to watch “every chad ever” on YouTube. And weekend update about Doge was hilarious and people panicking over nothing is just sad. It’s a comedy show. Elon did a great job. It’s like when that Clayton Morris’s guy of Morning Invest went after Bill Maher - he knew absolutely nothing about the show and spread so much false information. I hope you all sell doge so I can buy more. As Elon said- to the moon!
13186,"Use sunscreen, safety first"
13187,Elon is the real deal !!! He is not an actor but a genius that can move an entire economy. He is not fake !!! Dogecoin to the moon !!! Let’s go !!!!
13188,I suspect Kevin doesn't watch SNL much.  The skits were about average compared to the rest of the shows.  Not too bad.
13189,All i have to say is that word of the people is the most powerful weapon ever. If you want to see dogecoin go to the moon. Simply keep it relevant.
13190,"I’ve made more money on Doge than any stock Kevin has suggested to buy.  Reading body language, Kevin looks away or looks down from the camera.  Very telling. I’m sure he wished he bought when it was 4 cents.  Unsubscribing from this channel.  So tired of him selling all his crap."
13191,People got scared last night. It'll go up again.
13192,"INVESTING IN SPACE
SpaceX accepts Dogecoin as payment to launch ‘DOGE-1 mission to the Moon’ next year
CNBC, Reuters...etc. have reported this. This news is also on the Twitter first page with 300k retweets. how do you see this? Thank you."
13193,"Doge is supposed to be a joke.  Elon knows this,  he'll pump doge, but he says buy xrp,  especially when he says much wow. 
Gematria,  look it up."
13194,You can’t judge crypto on one day performance
13195,Just wanted to say you absolutely nailed it with your predictions. Hope you and the kids are having a blast!
13196,"10,000 doge mined per minute, infinitely. that is all."
13197,"SNL hasn’t been funny in years, they have gotten worse. They don’t want laughs, they want applause."
13198,Doge got the love. Time in the market is better than timing the market. Remind me who said that
13199,"SNL is a skit show. You're disappointed as if SNL was meant to be a Doge documentary. Of course they're gonna make fun of it, doge holders should be happy if was mentioned at all"
13200,Right? And as if they didn't know how those scripts might affect outcomes.
13201,"it's all emotions, it's part of the game.Doge will not go away and long term we will do very well. I added at .42 so not bad at all. If you didn't sell below your buys you didn't lose."
13202,BUY THE RUMOR SELL THE NEWS.
13203,"Since a rally in early February, several pullbacks have been observed in the Aave market. These pullbacks have been maintained by a strong support region present around $308. This area has proven to be a strong base for buying activity, and the most recent rally lay testament to that fact. However, resistance at $537 has also limited gains for AAVE. On the daily timeframe, a red candlestick appeared as the rally closed in on this upper ceiling while according to Squeeze Momentum Indicator, the market highlighted a squeeze release, and this indicated rising volatility. A pickup in the 24-hour trading volume was a positive sign and all eyes would be on the $537 barrier over the next few days and in case of a breakout, levels to look out for include $580 and $660. RSI traded below 60 but still maintained a bullish territory. l have been in the digital coin investment for a while and never seen any slgnaI service provider that works so effective and efficient like that of Burwell Coleman's trade s!gnaI. His daily trade s!gnals has really helped me grow my !nvestment in the crypt0 m@rket and with the right mentorship and str@tegy, crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for newbies and lnvestor. Burwell is also an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist and you can find his courses on tradlng on the internet for free and they come in handy as an !nvestor and he can be reached on gmαil (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom) and Եҽlҽցɾαต   (@burwellcoleman) for his assistance on crypt0 related enquires."
13204,Dogecoin? Plz. Rather try my luck at the track.
13205,"Not surprising you people falling for a 127,000,000,000 supply when billion dollar investment firms like Blackrock, JP Morgan, Fidelity, ARKK (Cathy Woods) and others aren't buying stupid crap like Doge but ether and bitcoin only. Lol The owners tells all on the investments as far as 10 year forward looking plans go."
13206,Kevin we saw the writing on the wall that a sell off was coming 😳😂🤣👀😐
13207,Kevin we love u bro!
13208,Seems most of you aren’t reading between the lines. I thought it was perfect. Best snl in awhile. I know that’s not saying much but it’s the establishment that ran out on it lol
13209,"wtf is this your stupid expectations of constant pumping, this is really ridiculous"
13210,SNL sucks
13211,SNL dont have good script from 20 years ago. WTF xD
13212,How can I make money from investments
13213,why are you guys still on Robinhood!? Leave that crap! AMC to the moon
13214,Kevin You’re looking quite nervous today 😬
13215,"Pretty green eyes, my friend you don’t get it. 🚀"
13216,Shiba coin is the way .. it’s the new dogecoin
13217,I was playing with $8.50 and that gives you 150 fractional shares of 0.000001 so it's kind of cool I was trading 0.0001500 shares or half like 0.0000750 or third like 0.0000500
13218,If your orders dont execute it's because other orders were placed before yours
13219,I don’t buy stocks on a crypto exchange so why would you buy crypto on a stock platform.  Crypto price are always different on different exchanges and DEX.   The price dipped because the run up in crypto is the pump....  Crypto traders knew it...  but I picked it up at .47....
13220,I think diamond hands would be holding short term dips for the longer rises
13221,People buy the dip and it's so volatile if you look at 1w 1M and 3M as time goes if price stays the same the percentage up or down goes up or down so if the first day continues to go down over time the current price can go down and stay the same if it goes up the price looks worse so I have been thinking 5 days ahead as the first day goes down it artificially looks better or if it goes up the price can go up invisibly
13222,"He just accepted payment for an entire lunar mission in dogecoins, if he wasnt the whale before, he surely is now"
13223,"We Got a Lucid Commercial, Thats positive"
13224,Wow woke comedy writers and staff didn't kill and a crypto hype date sells off. And Robinhood had issues AGAIN?
13225,Lol looks like we will need a video update Kevin! Dodge is back up and I know you heard the space X news lol!!
13226,I had huge problems with BTC orders not executing on Robin hood. If you go to messages and ask why they say there are only certain spots open and they go in order so other people put their order in first
13227,"You are wrong....!
Dogecoin is 4 ever!"
13228,SNL hasn't been relevant since Chris Farley was on the show.  And he's been dead for greater than twenty years...
13229,"Check 'wall street bets' on telegram, this is announce channel for the doge pumps. They have been making announcements from a long time, they message everyone that they will make huge pump on SNL event 8th of may. Channel have 420k members , Wall Street boys created great attention of people pump it and took the profits. They are playing like that from a long time making billions. They have another's channel with 1,5m members, they bamned me from convincing people to sell at 0,69$ when pump will happen. Any comments?"
13230,"You're all going to prison .
t. Insider"
13231,6:57 Wrong again. Tesla just announced it's accepting Dogecoin!
13232,"Do you even watch SNL??  It's a Skit !! So the messages that they are sending has always been reversed. Reverse Psychology. 

SNL has always made fun of the message that they're trying to send to you.
 
If they were straight up with the information, then you're better off watching the stupid news.

Watch while Doge gets pumped up. "" Not Squeeeeeezed out"""
13233,"4:30 WRONG! I already deleted 2 of my comments but I just can't. The Price of Dogecoin dropped BEFORE the show even got started! During the opening montage. It didn't get worse after or during that skit. I don't understand how something that happened AFTER could affect something that happened BEFORE! Unless traders are also Time Travelers? Most media outlets are getting it wrong but We were there. We were watching. That's NOT how it happened. If anything, the price recovered a little During the show and leading up to the skit at around. 55 cents. Regardless of how the media is trying to spin it, there wasn't a joke or a skit that caused the price drop. It was a calculation on the part of Whales to sell at .72 and more importantly... BEFORE Elon says anything and there's any time for anyone else to react. Just saying. (Otherwise, decent points.)"
13234,"Robinhood owns 28% of doge and they keep screwing over the people trying to sell at the peak so of course it's tanking. There's no evidence of this but some think that Citadel is pumping doge to make up the money for their shorts, which wouldn't surprise me but yeah. Get doge on anything but Robinhood! I think Gemini just got it"
13235,I feel like if Elon did something positive he would’ve easily been accused of market manipulation and doesn’t want to go down that route legally
13236,"Remember that SNL is a comedy show, Elon is not supposed to talk about it seriously. Personally, I think he did a great job and make a lot of people start researching about it after May 8th! Also, listen to the monologue, Elon and his mother talked about Elon created a video game about spaceship when he was 12 year-old, and he turned it into reality! Are they trying to imply that Elon will be able to turn Dogecoin into the major currency in the reality world? I believe that Elon will be able to do that."
13237,Kevin looks like he has heat exhaustion.
13238,Your awesome either way. Thanks for always taking care of us Kevin!
13239,Yea it went to a low of .40cents lol ; )
13240,It’s funny that they are having the same problem in the precious metals. Trying to get physical gold takes much longer than it normally takes.
13241,I hope you and the family are having fun!!
13242,What’s next for Doge is folks putting their money into ETC. ETC is coming for $1k this year! HODL! Diamond 💎 Hands 🙌
13243,"Kevin, we love you!! SpaceX is now saying they will take Doge coin..."
13244,this is why SAFEMOON is a better investment
13245,"SpaceX and Geometric Energy Corporation to launch DOGE - 1 to the MOON, paid with DOGE may be a good news :)"
13246,"If you're still up on DOGE move it to an actual investment coin. I cashed out a little profit last night and added it to my #TRON, #XRP, and #THETA coins. They are alt-coins with utilities."
13247,It's pushing 60c again.
13248,"SNL reminds me Tesla battery day Tesla dropped so heavy almost catastrophic drop 
I remember very shy Musk explained about new battery technology Why he is so shy when he is speaking in public ?!

In my opinion Mark Cubain is much better catalyst then Musk’s tweets"
13249,"Doge is a joke bro, the most we hoped for was it being mentioned not being pumped. A joke is better than nothing"
13250,whos dumb enough to still be using robinhood. you don't even have real ownership of your crypto on robinhood. get smarter guys
13251,https://youtu.be/6ElSWk54c-Y
13252,Too many commercials
13253,"Doge is the closest thing to a global fiat currency on the crypto side.  It’s value is whatever the market thinks it is.  It is backed by nothing more than itself.  Just like every currency.  People say those currency is backed by the country’s “output”, but that output is measured in the currency based on it.  Doge
Is the same way.  Producing it is the output.  The fact that it can readily be printed has not stopped fiat, so Doge has a place as more entities accept it.  The difference here is that the miners get the proceeds from mining it as opposed to the country when it sells its currency."
13254,Guys if you really want to make money on this pump/dump just put some money in Shiba Inu and you gone make a good amount
13255,Kevin really shows his age whenever he mentions 1337 😅
13256,"I think you don’t see the point, best doge show ever."
13257,Doge is not valuable!  why do you want Elon to lie. A lot of people will lose all their savings because of this invaluable coin.
13258,"Your not supose to use centralized exchanges to buy crypto. who point of crypto is to be decentralized.

Use defi or binance on defi"
13259,"doge is going to the moon, literally.. not even a question anymore (doge-1) google it"
13260,you think Doge is worth the price?
13261,Can you have weebl and Robinhood at the same time?
13262,This video was very interesting! If it wasn’t with the help of Mrs.Florence Gregory who knows how i would have survived the pandemic. she helped manage my assets by putting me on the right platform
13263,Doge coin  has made 50k millionaires and 1000 millions  bag holders so far
13264,https://youtu.be/Hr-G8YEWHn4
13265,i yolod all my money lost 30% of my 20k...yikes. expensive episode...ill recover i make about 500 a week so it'll only take me 2 ;months to get that back..its hard work ya know..and not fulfillling but ya know..ya.
13266,Erotic videos with Kevin...
13267,SNL. Hard to watch. Uncomfortable!
13268,"This is clearly part of the bubble signal. When a completely useless coin's ""value"" depends on an unrelated person's ""performance"" on SNL.  SMH."
13269,SNL has not been good since the 70s. There goes an hour of my life that I will never get back. I was hoping that the shorts would eat dirt but as usual they won. It's all good. I'm still up and Good luck to all.
13270,Doge is a joke.  Always has been.  You guys didnt know that?
13271,And then space x accepts doge....
13272,"tbh I'm very happy that people that got rolled in doge learned their lessons :)... don't buy meme things GME or Doge, yes you can make ALOT of money but there is insane risk of loosing it aswell. And a little advice use Binance :)"
13273,"Kevin, this was NOTHING more than the typical ‘Buy the rumor, sell the news’.  Start thinking of alt coins as stocks and you’ll see the same patterns.  IMO."
13274,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" #shibainu token ! #NFTArt token ! #ElonGate Token ! Check it out ! to the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑🌑"
13275,"I just going to hold on to the 1,837 doge I have, I may buy it while its so cheap in the mean time. At least that way when it dose go up I have more to sell. I hoping it gets to 60-70. I say that because  I rather take my chances in that way then cutting my losses and getting out now.  just got to have faith the funny thing is, I told my self I sell just before the show came on and it was like 0.71 by then but I hesitated. next thing you know it drops like a rock.  I should have just stick to that ops.  I do feel confident that we will get more hype to spike it up again sooner or later just have to keep a eye on this dog man."
13276,Doge Bouncing back.. SpaceX gonna be using it as payment
13277,"Yeah I got hosed where it would not let me sell, then it would only let me buy... wtf. It's entrapment!"
13278,Elon said it himself that it’s just a hustle.   But I have to admit when I had it at three cents and sold it because I was sooooo careful.  Dumb!   🤣.  Even when it was seven cents I thought that was getting high and a risk.   Now?   🤷🏻‍♀️
13279,The entire show was even more disgusting than I thought it would be. It was just free advertising for all of Musk’s businesses and shame on NBC for doing it. I hope this appearance negatively impacts his businesses. It’s time to stop worshipping this ego maniac. He only cares about his businesses. Investors are merely useful idiots to him.
13280,"Can't trust mainstream media to promote crypto. 
To the media crypto= China. 
Media doesn't like China that much."
13281,Set up..
13282,"buy rumor sell news, it's been proven over and over with Doge lol. you think people would catch on by now."
13283,"Thanks so much, Elon Duch, just outted himself. SOLAR WIND is radiation that kills DNA at 400 miles in altitude. Moon walk never happened, but in a movie set. No tech writers explained how space suites were self contained units. And how the moon cars were mounted on LEM. Musk is a space fraud."
13284,I swear someone is either paying him off or his personal investments are threatened by doge.
13285,"have you all forgotten about Litecoin cash it will take nothing to get this coin to a dollar and it only a few cents now.  Do the math total supply is 722,343,700 and a market cap of 20 million.  This is a no-brainer plus the branding of litecoin its self."
13286,"But on Robinhood, I was also unable to place a Market Buy last night (not limit buy)."
13287,There is a spread on ETC between RH and Coinbase... it’s not just Doge
13288,Elon played whoever sold. We going to the moon on Doge 1 payed entirely by dogecoin:D
13289,"I am happy with Robinhood 
I have to say Robinhood is preventing to sell doges that’s very good thing"
13290,JUST IN: SpaceX announces DOGE-1 mission launching a Rocket to the moon that will be fully funded by DOGE
13291,Doge IS a joke. Don't get it twisted. It was always meant to dump after Elon hit SNL.

13293,"DOGE IS SELLING AT .7 !!!!  It will go to 1000. Just take a look at Ethereum, Bitcoin."

I remember very shy Musk explained about new battery technology Why he is so shy when he is speaking in public ?"
13302,All cryptocurrencies are nothing but jokes. Waiting for 70-80% dump. POS
13303,Worst SNL ever.
13304,"I just found out that Elon Musk was sending out secret hand signs to people holding Doge coins... I guess he was secretly telling everyone to hold. But that went over my head and I thought he was just trashing Doge coin with his hustle comment... but I was wrong. My apologies Elon Musk, I wasn’t aware of those cool secret hand codes... I kept my doge and bought more when it dropped. I guess the Doge coin holders are the hustlers. I still believe there should be a penalty for those who hold a huge percentage of Doge, to protect people and the future of this currency. Way to go Elon Musk! Let’s Gooooo 🚀🚀🚀"
13305,I don’t get it. It was going to be the but of the joke.....

(I’m blaming you but I know it’s all me)"
13310,"This just proves how baseless the valuations are for these companies which rely solely on speculative, subjective values and nothing objective or fue to anything they produce. If your company is solely reliant on someone else’s comments, even just the mere mention, then you’re investing in hype."

13320,SNL is a socialist 🤡 show and thats the butt of the joke.
13321,Yeah kevin I agree i hate how crypto takes forever to fill..thats no bueno
13322,Too many adverts Kevin - keep them to a minimum given you are already making money
13323,Sold 100k coins at .71 for back in at .39 took the profits and got more coins. Woot.
13324,I got my initial investment out already. I've been playing with the profits.
13325,"The show was amazing. Elon is a great actor. Doge didn’t not come down because of snl or Elon. 

It seems that you don’t understand how buy and sell orders work. 

Take your conspiracy theories  and shove it. 
You are dumb."
13326,Fuck woke disney.. doge will continue going up regardless
13327,Told you Kevin need to do more research 🧐 on the satellite 🛰.......
13328,You’re better off going to Vegas than investing in Doge
13329,New sub.
13330,enough with these big events days on Doge the organic growth is the way for the Doge but it does has its utility plus theres Space X Doge-1 its just not visible to the newbie in the crypto space ironically they come in through Doge more than BTC now
13331,Has smart money got out of doge?
13332,"I would not be on a platform that manipulates it’s trades, Binance and cardano people. I’ve never had problems selling or buying on binanace."
13333,HELLLLO9.......stop usiNg robinhood.. SIMPLE FIX
13334,I don’t have Robin Hood. But when I sell it takes like seconds and seconds to buy. I don’t know your your transaction are so slow. It Doge coin

13336,Buy and Hold ! Tesla and space x not a game.Elon musk knows how dogcoin gonna work.
13337,"Sad, when your depending on SNL to make a coin viable. Real coins rely on their fundamentals and utility. Pshhhh.. unreal."
13338,"Robinhood is a horrible platform.  It took me 10 mins to figure out how to cancel a limit order.  However, once I canceled my limit order, I was able to immediately fill my market order to sell DOGE.     1 BILLION DOGE are added annually.   This coin is not sustainable at this level.  Sell if you have profit"
13339,They SNL hate Elon musk. And used him as a joke.
13340,You buy all the hype and blame your loses on everyone else
13341,It's just selling the news haha our group speculated this last week. Run up until SNL and sell off
13342,When Doge was mentioned on SNL did it scare off people trying to short the market in fear that Doge would go up and stay up? It was mentioned in a comedy. That was the hope.
13343,anyone who says invest in DOGE should be blocked
13344,"Kevin got me with that bearded thumbnail. Lol the old bait and switch.  Now you see the beard,  now you don't"

13347,The acts were great! Some of them will be classics
13348,Whats next for doge you ask? The fucken trash can where it belongs...
13349,Wait for it
13350,This is a very valuable lesson we don't  Need one person to say something to make It go up to a dollar we almost did that on our own  We were damn near a dollar it was almost or probably touched 75 cents before snl The lesson is all about 🎯unity🎯  So let's make this thing touch a dollar then our next goal is to make it touch $2 Once we get that far the work will do itself
13351,Robinhood is wreck.
13352,You really think Robinhood. P.O.S. whales  would let the little guy win i don't think so
13353,Just bought dogecoin at $0.56 bought 25 coins. Yeah!
13354,Robinhood is one of those Doge whales !
13355,Michael Che was acting like a little bitch towards Elon musk!! U couldn't definitely tell there was tension in the air from the cast. They were intimidated by the richest man in the world clearly
13356,I cashed out. I think Silber and co is done with the coin and is killing it. Who’s selling? Who’s holding? Who’s buying the dip?
13357,https://youtu.be/BbDJIoY7W78
13358,"Doge is a meme. Who cares if it dies. It’s not a serious investment, only noobs are shocked."
13359,Plenty of doge buy and sell transactions happening on kraken. Webull and Robinhood are trash. All is good until you need to sell. Robinhood is done.
13360,Disappointing episode for Doge HODLers :(
13361,"WARNING.. I been saying this.. The dogefather tanked Doge, the community cannot rely or accept or follow someone like that! Soooo.. We need a real dogefather a new one that is positive about Doge and doesn't make it look stupid. So get on twitter and simply post the hashtag #newdogefather and let's see if we can get Jeff bezos or someone involved. Elon is a idiot that didn't life Doge but made it look stupid on live TV. You want lambo? You wana get to the moon? #newdogefather share pass on and let's stop loosing money 💰.."
13362,This looks like the etoys of crypto.
13363,Probably can't handle the high volume

its not worth selling
maybe i should sell it and buy lottery tickets instead"
13365,Come on man... it was kinda ok and cringi
13366,299k veiws 4.6k comments and 12k likes? The ratio there is crazy... like gentleman its very easy to like.
13367,I think that Elon understands that SNL kind of calls the shots on its own show and that is Main Stream Opinion. Elon represented good and was funny. He also showed 💎🙌 at the show opening.

13369,Well this is 100% wrong. Doge will hit $1 this year and you will back track your statement. People want this to succeed. Hedgies didn't want GME to get to $1000 and they use every trick to destroy it. Hedgies can't touch the peoples coin.
13370,"Some of the actors were given a safe space in case they didn't want to work with Elon. A lot of people consider him ""controversial"" 🙄"
13371,SNL SUCKED SO BAD IT CRASHED
13372,Kevin appreciate you and your hard work sir but could you please please invite jim Richards live on your show and interview him would be so grateful because you can ask tough questions and not afraid ware other sites are scared to ask questions like you do for guest on your site
13373,Buy the dip!
13374,"I'm glad your bringing up these issues, these glitches are very concerning and financially dangerous! I felt flashbacks from the AMC/GME phenomenon. Robinhood/Webull causing investor anxiety!!!"
13375,"Dude, doge is a trash coin. Stop hyping it. You're not this dumb, are you."
13376,"It’s nice to see you out of your box lol
Enjoy your time out of the basement, you so deserve it!"
13377,"Politely Disagree, the SNL skits were hilarious...had us all ROFLMAO. As we have learned from Cybertruck no publicity is bad publicity!"
13378,SNL sucks!
13379,Buy dip while you can
13380,Now hes a crypto analists?
13381,kevin kevin kevin.... go back and watch the trump appearance on snl.    theres ur answer. the liberals dont like elon.
13382,robinhood is a scam if your keep using it youll keep getting screwed over
13383,Doge IS a joke. Don’t understand the disappointment.
13384,SNL hasn't been funny in like 25 - 30 years.
13385,I thought you were suppose to be on vacation.
13386,DOGE-1 to the moon!
13387,Enjoy the vacation with your family Kevin!!!
13388,You're getting too serious about a meme currency.
13389,Look so young shaved
13390,It's called having fun bro. Don't take it so seriously.
13391,But Kevin doge is a damn joke... it has no value other than fools trying to get other fools to buy it... some others are good like Eth algo cardano etc...
13392,https://youtu.be/Hr-G8YEWHn4
13393,oh my goodness kevin… you might not understand that comedy…. or maybe you do and just want to spread FUD…..
13394,I think Elon screwed it up when he agreed that doge is a hustle....lame AF
13395,"Well havent cha heard?!? SHIBB is the next big squeeze, get in while it's  worth it or you'll get doged"
13396,kevin isnt this proof .... if one guy can make a comment  and people freak out ... lets be smart people ... Greed is not always good..buyer beware
13397,"I mean the coin description literally said its a ""meme"" and a ""joke""?? Not to mention Elon mentioning its just a ""hustle"" was worse lol."
13398,"Crypto will be much advisable to invest on now,I have a personal broker who will help you trade"
13399,Rip pro the doge
13400,"Kevin would be the guy to update us on doge while on vacation, enjoy the vacation Kevin, you deserve a break!"
13401,Defetinely pre made scripts
13402,The general public is rude to say the least. I am losing faith in the human race. Keep up the good work Kevin
13403,At first I was like ... This sucks... Then it was like ok a little funny
13404,I think he meant to buy Dogecoin today on Mother's Day it would be on sale
13405,"The WORST thing Elon said at the end of SNL... ""Doge is just a hustle"" Fuuk"
13406,"Kevin, thoughts on the doge shiba showing up on the amazon app??  Search ‘amazon day’ on the app and check it out dog🐈"
13407,Let’s get this ETH
13408,Can you cover Cardano?
13409,gemini doge staking is the additional good news
13410,"Nono, I was unable to buy any Doge during the SNL skit (towards the middle)"
13411,support level 69 - i support this
13412,😂😂😂😵
13413,whenever dates are proposed then the big players come out and short it. We need to lose the dates.
13414,Your probably one of the douch bags that sold.
13415,Elon warned investors the day before .....
13416,"RH lost 4 million accounts due to GME in January, and now they are promoting DOGE but have 'technical issues' every time theres significant hype? How are people still confused? Robinhood is manipulating people. Notice also that the majority of RH, WeBull, and eToro income comes from Citadel."
13417,"Why use robinhood?
They seem like dodgy scammers to me..."
13418,"I read a story at like 1am this morning saying they did the news skit and basically told everyone doge was a grift.
then i looked at the charts and saw it dipped right at like 10:30 pm"
13419,Barry Silbert shorted it and tweeted about it its his fault. If it hadnt already dipped then the dip from snl might not have been so bad and paper hands wouldnt have got so scared...
13420,Lol I bought in at .08 cents so I'm still gucci
13421,buy the rumour sell the news. I was saying it to myself in my head for the whole week. Pity I fell asleep 2 hours before snl and my sell order at 72cents somehow didnt get filled....
13422,i rather watch puppets doing the skits
13423,Thumbnail beard to no beard whyyyy lol
13424,Where is Kevin who is this guy😶
13425,1 Doge = 1 doge lol it can fall to a penny and I would still drop a few grand lol the golden days 😎
13426,THE FUXKING ADS GODDAMMIT!!!!! 😤👎🏿
13427,"I admire the efforts you put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it is not too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Laurent Sebastien , with his guide and signal service i ' ve made over 9B TC worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues connect Laurent   on te_leg_ram @ { LaurentTrade} insights."
13428,Only thing that shined was the Lucid Air commercial.
13429,"Economics, rocket science, electric vehicles with comedy will never mix."
13430,I sold a large chunk of my Doge at $0.70. Left about 500 coin in play to see where it goes since it's paid for by the casino.
13431,"Elon did pretty good for a non-performer, but ya, you could tell that some cast members mailed it in."
13432,The skits were hilarious and doge ain't worth shit anws
13433,30 seconds into the video there are Ads.. now that is the real disappointment
13434,SNL is a satire show so negativity is expected we shouldn't take it so seriously DOGE will continue to rise 🚀
13435,I love Kevin! He so damn smart!
13436,"on vacation and yet you're still updating everyone. You my dude, are one hard working hombre"
13437,People are silly selling GEVO. Three major GEVO investors are on Biden’s cabinet. GEVO will pump again
13438,😂
13439,Welcome your communist tech overlords you poor millennials
13440,Meet Kevin. You don’t think the biggest wallets are selling webull and robinhood were selling it off!!!  If all of us did they couldn’t sell. We don’t own them they do.
13441,"Seriously?! 3 ads in less than 8 min? Not cool man, not cool at all"
13442,Doge deserves to goto 0
13443,Doge is a joke and you’re only playing who’s the greater fool.
13444,"Buy the Rumor and Sell the News, all Crypto OGs knew to sell before the event. Crypto isn’t like stocks and when your hoping for something to happen it almost always doesn’t and dumps."
13445,"i think you missed something big here mate. there is a huge crypto fund shorting doge and thats the reason for it falling. there isnt retail people selling. they are actually buying to fight it, and they will lose their money like they did with GME.."
13446,If you link the destiny of your money to a joke or a twitt you don't deserve that money.
13447,Kevin tf enjoy your vacation
13448,Doge is meme coin thats it. People are trading it buy the rumor sell the news. There will be a good amount bag holding.
13449,Thank you for your updates. Even when your on vacation.  Awesome job. You'll make a wonderful governor. Wish you were running in Georgia
13450,Man.. shut the fuck up
13451,It took me a fucking hour to sell
13452,"Everyone misses the point. SNL equated fiat as being backed by gold, which it’s not. Many people still believe this, and I wish Elon would have made one comment about it."
13453,Have a fun vacation !!!
13454,"What's better? Give your mom $ 0.50, $ 1 or $ 5. We have to wait until May 26."
13455,DOGE is a joke. It's always been a joke. Why is it even at .40? It's all chasing. Of course this was going to happen and going back under .10. It shouldn't even be at .01
13456,Sell the news 📰🔻
13457,It’s a hustle. You’re buying nothing.
13458,Brother look into xrp before is too late !!!
13459,SNL needs a reboot 🤔
13460,Doge is a pump and dump
13461,420 day taught us there would be a sell off the day.  Sell the news
13462,"Typical buy the rumor and sell the news in Dogecoin, Dogecoin was way overhyped going into SNL show, normal to sell off after, new traders need to learn this happens all the time"
13463,Very good analysis.
13464,I hate to say it but I agree 100% - fundamentally driven (vs) hype/media driven .. great analysis.
13465,"If someone has long term outlook you will buy on the big dip just like how Kevin has taught this group regarding stocks that you believe in.  Doge is no different.  Cryptos has always been volatile.  The key is for Dogecoin to be accepted by major retailer like an Amazon, Target, etc...If this happens it will go beyond $1."
13466,"Binance.US is better
Fulfill orders is instantly"
13467,"Was this doge dump not expected? Like everything, buys the news and sell the event."
13468,"We need to rebrand Doge AWAY from this effing dog🐶, it is NOT good for the brand."
13469,How dare you tease me.... I clicked on a bearded Kevin thumbnail and got a shaved Kevin! Lol
13470,the whales will not let doge go to a dollar so fast. they are in controle.  next time .80 then crash to .50      they will keep making money on every ride.   probably the best ratings for snl in 10 years.    snl sucks.
13471,"Crypto isnt stock, you are being played. Doge is a shit coin. Fomo is real. Elon is a bitch and there is no real use for doge."
13472,"get into a coin ""VET"" with actual value and partners. DHL BMW Renault Walmart China Louis Vuitton and many many moreand only at 20c. Go google Vechain partners and see for yourself"
13473,"Safemoon, Saturna and Bonfire! 🔥🔥🔥"
13474,I thought the scripts were funny but they were definitely making fun of Doge.
13475,Is okey DOGECOIN will go to the moooon 🤑🤑🤑🍾
13476,I been telling people this wasn't going to be good for doge. 🤷🏽‍♂️
13477,Most speculative plays have double heads. This will be no different.
13478,Disagree. Loved the content
13479,people literally talking about how someone going snl and skits didn't create a pump. just insanity.
13480,"Can someone please help? I bought Dogecoin on Simplex and got a code as ""destination cryptocurrency wallet address"", but I have no idea where/how to put that code to get my Dogecoins."
13481,The entire Doge phenomenon was Elon testing his tweet power. Nothing more. It's over now.
13482,I thought it was hilarious!!! But I was also high af
13483,"No, it got the love it's supposed to get... none... that how much people should give it. No idea why people are investing in a ""coin"" offering that is fueled by NOTHING but hype. GL to you all that invest in it and my heart goes to those that will lose most of their investment."
13484,"Kevin if anyone you should not be even speaking on dogecoin.

Let's get coins that have real futures and features for real world benefits.

Telcoin."
13485,investors are bailing out of DOGE and buying ADA
13486,"... well, if the Doge is any good, then there is a nice dip to buy."
13487,"We knew this will happen!!! 
I sold on Friday!!!!"
13488,Buy the dip. I just finished buying 1000 more tokens. Now holding 12k  tokens. Ill probably stop around 25k then just hold and wait wait.
13489,Looooooooooooool
13490,"Dog-E-coin is just a pump and dump...if you don't know by now. Crypto savvy people draw in a bunch of suckers and then steal their money. So if the plan to pump the coin to over a dollar and then dump it for a profit doesn't work, great. The more I learn about crypto-savvy people from way back when, the more I see just a bunch of greedy evil fktards preying on the desperate."
13491,"I made enough money on Doge to seed plenty of Wall Street stocks. I did my DD knowing that I might lose it all. Then I held onto the credo of ""Buy the rumor. Sell the news."" 
Before the show started, I could feel the uneasiness that it was mirroring the 420 (April 20th) hype. 
It was right for Elon to voice concern well before the show to not YOLO one's savings into such investments."
13492,Elon acted like a DOGEBAG
13493,Did Kevin sell his Doge?
13494,"Satoshi 
Nakamoto 
Live"
13495,Y'all don't believe. I'm holding.
13496,"Robinhood is trash. 
Get off Robinhood."
13497,"Wait, Kevin is hiring vloggers who need to have covid vaccination, but he’s going to Disneyland. 🤦‍♂️"
13498,He didn’t have to say anything at all. Also Robinhood fucked everyone for not letting people sell nor buy same as Webull that whole show. Why aren’t you talking about that? Also the whales who sold millions and millions during snl hmm
13499,I thought that Elon was pretty funny last night.... I guess I’m in the minority?
13500,The “difficulty” is them doing it all on purpose. No coincidence
13501,"I'm concerned... that anyone (including you, Kev) is taking a meme crypto seriously... and trying to build some sort of whacky investment thesis on it. Wtf indeed."
13502,Elon Musk screwed the people so screw him and #fu@!Tesla #fu@!elonmusk
13503,Dude goes on vacation says he will gone all weekend. First day at Disney- Hey Guys coming to you from Disneyland.
13504,"Two post in support of @realmeetkevin and Twitter flags my account as spam. My Twitter account is 4 years old with hundreds, maybe thousands of post and comments."
13505,The future for doge.....is sell it and buy your self a crypto that actually has a use case.... do yourself a favor  people and get into defi
13506,It’s because of people like you Doge isn’t on the moon yet! Just HODL or Buy! Stop selling and buying!!!
13507,Hey govner' Doge is a fucking joke!
13508,Am I the only one who thinks that Elon tanks a stock only to buy more cheap.
13509,Reverse pump and dump by musk possibly? Can we see if he has bought any?
13510,Buy the dip
13511,Doge is a joke
13512,Buy low. That’s all
13513,Doge coin flop
13514,I’ve never seen a drunk Kevin before. Interesting.
13515,Robinhood sucks. Use Voyager for crypto
13516,"When he said it was just a hustle, that's the part that hurt Doge the most... But that goes for all the cryptos. It's going to be fine, everything's going to be fine..."
13517,"All great things are a joke to snl: America, Trump, Musk, Dogecoin"
13518,a flop now I'm mad
13519,Sounds like Kevin is disappointed that Elon Didn’t pump a joke cryptocurrency with no intended or future use case or supply cap
13520,On a side note.  I tuned into SNL last night in a very long time and was reminded why I stop watching it.  It isn’t funny like the 90s to early 2000s.  Anyway the direction dogecoin took is interesting.
13521,*** Low of 0.40
13522,Why would you hold crypto on Robinhood? Can someone explain this nonsense to me?
13523,The point wasn’t $1 ... the point was to get more eyes and minds on dogecoin and crypto currency ... it will be the currency of earth or Mars
13524,"“Buy the rumor, sell the news.” retail attempted to pump it while the hedge fund frat boys dumped it on everyone’s lap. If you are using robinhood to trade crypto then you need to really re-think your commitment to the crypto market. KuCoin, Coinbase pro, Binance allow you to truly own crypto. Robinhood is for people who are just trying to make a quick buck by flipping crypto back to USD. USD is on the decline while crypto is on the rise. So you are selling something that’s more valuable to accumulate something that is becoming less valuable. Really Boggles my mind how some people are so blind."
13525,I liked the Show I think your take on the show was off... Robinhood definitely fishy though
13526,Doge is a great memecoin
13527,Thats why you dont buy an asset with an intrinsic value of $0
13528,"Don't be scared, be patient and hold! #dogecoin"
13529,"The sell off started before SNL started, It was down 0.15 before the programing started. I did notice Robinhood was acting weird, very slow"
13530,ive read articles that say coinbase is insured. but that both blockfi and coinbase cold store your crypto. and blockfi gives you the incentive of interest but coinbase is starting back log to also give interest for holding your crypto with them. im interested in getting into crypto but i want to have it in the best location. coinbase is the broker that im leaning towards however im unsure if ive over looked anything with these two or if ive overlooked another promising broker. looking for input. please and thank you.
13531,Those skits were horrible.  Although SNL has been bad in general.  Damn paper hands were like nope...I'm taking my gains now! #dogewillbounceback #stilltothemoon
13532,"Thank you Kevin , Robinhood wouldn’t let me sell at all and when it actually went through 20 mins later I lost so much ."
13533,Stop working on vacation!
13534,I think u (and many folks) went in with too high expectations lol
13535,Enjoy your trip Kev!
13536,l
13537,They weren't preventing only selling. I couldn't buy on the initial drop when it was under .50
13538,2:50 I had the same thing on Webull but this was  a week ago. That buy order never filled it is still up right. But the other 2 I put in filled 45 mins and 37 mins after
13539,"A meme joke coin, going down with negative joke not a surprise."
13540,elon just left us... we're on our own dogecoin never dies
13541,They need better writers. They made Elon look like Barney.
13542,I'll stick with BitCoin and Ethereum 😆
13543,You don't know anything about Dogecoin. You just want the views. Bye.
13544,"SNL is a bunch of cowards now, you see it in the topics and scripts. They make the easy jokes about people like Trump and these old “safe” topics .

Real comedy doesn’t need to be massively offensive but it’s a necessary by product from pushing the limits which they’re no longer doing."
13545,Elon Musk has a disability
13546,"Doge is a joke of a coin, why does anyone get upset when it falls because of a damn comedy show? haha its a bit ironic."
13547,It was pure jokes like Doge was originally intended to be.  Doge will live on and speculators will continue to pile in until it dumps to .002 and remain an internet tipping meme coin.
13548,The pump happened before air. Everyone anticipated a jump and bought early.
13549,Hold the line people 🚀🙌🏻 1$. In 3 months
13550,Heh you already shaved - lol         Good time to buy -  now we  know
13551,Love? Elon outright called Doge “a hustle.”
13552,"Doge was literally created as a joke!!!!! Why are people not understanding this??? Doge has no future! 10 million Doge are created EVERY DAY! thats like the fed creating 100 billion every day since creation!  it has no future, no plan, no nothing.  it is called a MEME coin for a reason.   There are only 3 crypto's that have more ""circulating supply"" than doge.... come on.  This is almost as bad as pushing or recommending bitconnect"
13553,SNL is the garbage of trash
13554,"Wow, those of you who are using stock exchanges to buy crypto are fucking idiots. Use Crypto exchanges! Trade 24/7"
13555,"Y'all be hating. I thought Elon did a great job. Most of the skits were good except the doctor one. And who couldn't predict a Doge selloff during SNL. Not a surprise. I agree, Robinhood and Webull aren't helping the situation either. Rumor has it Robinhood owns a large percentage if Doge, so limiting selling wouldn't surprise me."
13556,"The DOGE network needs to confirm orders.  This process takes about 20 minutes to make confirmations on their network.  Nothing to do with those exchanges.  For example when I send my mined DOGE from my wallet to an exchange, it takes 20 minutes."
13557,"The scripts are never great and for snl it was ""funny"" meaning its never funny but some skits were decent. Snl sux"
13558,Are we all in agreement to not have anymore set pump date for Dogecoin.
13559,Does doge ever die? I think not
13560,DELEVERAGE
13561,"I don't know who needs to hear this but you gat to stop saving all your money, invest some if you want financial freedom ❤️. I placed my trade on Fred Green platform and it has been good returns"
13562,My thought is that Musk initially tweeted about doge as a joke and it took off. He is now trying to get out of the joke gone wrong without completely wrecking people
13563,This is the way..... trust the process. #DOGEARMY
13564,Looks like you're in the area . I recommend going to amorelias mexican cafe for breakfast
13565,Trade on binance wtf u guys doing
13566,You’re kind of annoying now .
13567,Change the name from Dogecoin German word for shower coin it's a wash out
13568,"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money"
13569,You people are missing the point doge was mention many times in one show that was broadcast to humongous audience give it a year or 2
13570,"UMMM, the dropped didnt happen because of SNL. This was Barry Silbert and his cronnies pulling out and openly qnd purposely telling everyone to drive the crypto down. First time I have seen Kevin not do due dilegence. Dissapointed."
13571,"Value of $1,000 invested 1 year ago: 

PIRATE CHAIN: $311,590
Dogecoin: $274,521
Ethereum: $17,186
Bitcoin: $5,872"
13572,"Check out bonfire token! up ALOT past days, it has a roadmap and are not a pump and dump coin! invest your money! you wont regret it🚀"
13573,"To be fair, doge had some correction last night but is still hodling strong. Last night made a believer in the community wanting it to go up. I still don't own any, but the doge community def changed my outlook on it"
13574,"I believe that you are  upset cause you don’t have enough doge,,, Cain of negative there buddy"
13575,Chad was hilarious
13576,Kevin you seem depressed about doge  coin . I hope you didn’t lose millions when you bought it in the 60s. Good luck . I hope you get your money back .
13577,Love your energy Kevin….💖……..your the Energzr Bunny of youtube….appreciate you!…….Enjoy a well deserved  vacation.🎉
13578,Guy is whing about first vacation on 15 months when his whole life is a vacation.  Try no vacation in years
13579,Makes a joke about a joke coin .. dont see anything wrong here .. doge coin doesnt have anything to do with Elon musk wtf. Its falling because the coin is a JOKE .. kevin your a clown. I used to like your material . Dogecoin hype ? Get real
13580,Lol u had a few drinks before this I'm guessing keep the videos comin
13581,People dumb enough to put their money into Dogecoin deserve to lose it all. Fools and their money are soon parted. Suckers!
13582,"Before SNl, I saw on Robinhood that dogecoin founder, Silber, has shorted it. I thought uh oh. SNL’s purpose was to sink the stock. I just can’t believe that Elon was a part of it"
13583,I’m just wrapping my head around this circus.  A SNL skit drives the movement of a trading security (or asset) by 40-50%.  Some joke?
13584,"Lol why is everyone so surprised, it was so obvious there would be a high potential people selling off for profit. Kevin is too experienced to not know this so I’m sure he saw it coming too. It’ll consolidate and doesn’t matter much if you’re willing to hold for more than a couple months. Most likely $1 in a month or two and the people who panic sold are be like wwhhhhaaaaaa"
13585,Hey nice shaved look
13586,considering robinhood holds over 25% of all dogecoin.... yeah... sounds about right.
13587,"Lol, sounds like you had a blast all day haha"
13588,Billions of dollars were pulled out.....and the market didnt drop below .40...and is holding at .50....use ur brain....the whales pulled out yet it's still holding at .50.....lol BUY IN MORE AND HOLD!
13589,Bitcoin sabotage
13590,If you don’t like buying dogecoin buy some bitcoin for 50k and watch it drop
13591,Gemini give interest yield on Dogecoin. It'll go UP for sure guys.
13592,CIA WROTE THE SCRIPT FOR TJE SHOW.
13593,But that is why Doge went down because rich people buy presents only if they are in sale !!!! I know riches mentality
13594,The gamblers got shaken lol
13595,Nah you don’t see it the way I do. This was great for dogecoin
13596,"Elon calling it a hustle, not great!"
13597,These newbie traders never learn to sell the fking news.
13598,Kevin are you placing limit orders or market orders? Shouldn’t a market order fill instantly regardless of price?
13599,I lost around a thousand dollars in 15 min because I couldn’t get my order fulfilled. It was profit that I lost but cmon. Same thing lol. Once you see profits it’s the same as your money lol. It’s ridiculous
13600,I dont know I thouhgt it was fine. If yall want off the rocket I'll buy your tickets from you
13601,Make a video about SHIBA INU
13602,Drunk Kevin is pretty funny.
13603,"Bought doge at 0.05$ and sold at 0.73$ , 15k$ made with a meme , thank you doge"
13604,Awesome Kev!! Thanks for the update 😄👍🏼👍🏼... great to see you in a more chilled setting...  out and about 👌
13605,Is it time to short sell?
13606,Kevin tipsy and on vacation and still at work. I don't think he knows how to stop lol
13607,Is there a better no fee place to buy crypto than coinbase
13608,The video was definitely made under the influence. Lol
13609,Remember that time Wealthfront was touted on this channel...
13610,I need doge back to .70. Then I can sell and buy more Etherium. 💪
13611,Yeah see I said all this. So many ppl are like OMG IT WAS SO GOOD FOR DOGE....and im like NAH IT WASNT
13612,Right like he made Doge look bad right??
13613,"It is a joke, I’m happy I’m in a crypto coin ADA"
13614,You wanted sale after make money that is the reason helloo use videos to send a stock to thr moon or to crash
13615,Doge was already selling off before the show...
13616,"Calling Dog-e coin....""doje'"" coin is like Joe Dirt calling himself Joe ""Dirt'e"
13617,"Same thing happened at the last hype, it will take few days to a week consolidating around 0.40-45 and go up to .80-90 or of course the $-"
13618,Some ones drunk 🍻
13619,"When has SNL (with original cast, not w/ Baldwin) had a good script in the past 5 years?"
13620,Vacation??
13621,We expected alot from elon and he was doing freakin drama on a show when he knows people expectation still he did'nt said anything great stupid elon
13622,this was all a comedy. Who was expecting to make millions is just a fool. Congrats to who made profit and walked away.
13623,Is Covid over in the USA?
13624,Buy the rumor sell it the news.
13625,Twitter Wario means up&down. so Hold!!
13626,"*Did Elon Abandon Doge?*
*m..aybe...Doge doesn't die..*"
13627,Why is he wearing a jacket in California? Its pretty warm there.
13628,Get vechain bro
13629,Are there market makers for crypto or is it just the brokerages responsibility to protect customers by not executing orders at fire sale prices
13630,Doge is shit people....always has been always will be.....invest in fundamentals not memes.
13631,However RLC had a major run up on CB sense its debute Thursday
13632,"""The scripts weren't that great..."" That's putting it kindly, and you just described SNL for the last 20 years."
13633,Thumbnail misleading 😤
13634,"Still holding though! Its gonna keep rising it's a short correction 
$1 is way possible, look @ all these no name coins in the dollar range"
13635,I knew it etc classic on roobinhood is up more then on other sites ppl buying at a over price😯
13636,Buy the rumor sell the news
13637,Stop buying jokes and speculative bs.... you guys are going to continue to get wrecked.
13638,THANK YOU KEVIN FOR YOUR HONEST AND FAIR EVALUATION - C.R.
13639,do you watch SNL usually?
13640,"Kevin! You are talking from the perspective of your own selfish interest. 

Elon did not go to SNL to make or break doge! 

He went there for the ""first principles"" of entertainment.

Put up your greed for once, bro! Elon doesn't owe you anything and doesn't exist to make you money. Jeez!"
13641,The real news to be is that SNL is still being made.
13642,if your in it to get rich right away then you shouldn’t be in this you gotta be in it for the long run he will make Doge strong for investors who stay strong
13643,I don’t know why Snl was so unfunny last night. They had millions of people watching with anticipation and then delivered an awful show
13644,"Buy the hype, sell the news.

Of course Doge was the butt of a joke, on a bad comedy show.  Who didn't see that coming?"
13645,Still more stable then the bolivar.
13646,"Can we now acknowledge all this stuff is insanity and trying to ""analyze this ""market"""
13647,Skits weren’t all that bad Hahha. He’s autistic so if he wasn’t comedian of the year then chill. The conversation should be. Why are people such paperhand pussies based on a SNL skit 😂  not to mention you saying Robinhood and all this retail trash hahah. Ppl learn how to buy actual crypto. Not this IOU bull shit from retail investor apps 🤷‍♂️ NFA hahaha but recall the purpose of crypto. To decentralize. Giving an exchange your social security and ID is NOT private or centralized. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NEW FOUND INTEREST IN CRYPTO AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE ROOTS !! Bitcoin is totally traceable for example. Not the point
13648,I mean.. Instead of looking at it like something bad. Look at the run it had! Millions were made. I'm sad I missed it
13649,Buy GME
13650,10 ads for a 10 min video. Nice.
13651,"Buy red sell green.
This is the opportunity for the idiots that bought green to actually make some money. 
But they're idiots so they probably sold at $.50 instead of DCA down the slope lmfao.."
13652,Why did anyone think Elon would drop ground shaking news on a comedy sketch show?
13653,"Gemini allows you to buy and sell instantaneously even during the most congested moments using the Market option.

Can be a double edged sword though cause Ive hit that button to buy and just watched the price dropped as I did."
13654,"I was pissed on friday because I couldnt get money to buy DOGE, but now I'm happy because it dropped to $0.4 and I will be able to buy more on monday. My last investment was when DOGE was costing $0.24."
13655,Doge hit 40c
13656,God dam paper handed weenie babies
13657,Holy advertisements kevin.... did you lose millions on doge and you’re trying to make it back on this video alone?! 6 ads for a 15 minute video?! Sheeeeeeesh
13658,"Kevin, RH has always been preventing people buying or selling Doge during the past few runs we saw. I've lost so much money because of it. It's really frustrating"
13659,Amc going to moon 🌙 💎🦍💎🦍💎🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
13660,Amc to moon 🌙 get in people 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿✅
13661,Wife works on on the network and this was recorded Friday. 🤣
13662,"Even though I think that Dogecoin shouldn’t be influenced by well known person, Elon Musk really ruined it. 🤯😩"
13663,"It was the best for the joke doge is, not more not less than it deserves."
13664,I didn't watch because SNL hasn't been funny for years and Elon does not come across as a funny guy.
13665,"Most of the cast sat out because they were triggered by the big bad capitalist CEO. In fact, Lorne Michaels put out a statement about it."
13666,"There was a news article that said the actors could sit out since Elon is so controversial. Some actors don't like him as a person. Probably has stance on covid not being a big deal they even had a skit about him being wrong about masks. But that'll change. He will come out and reinstate his stance. I tried to sell last night and couldn't. My uphold app was frozen, it couldn't even load and show me the gui. Sad night for crypto. Stupid Elon tanked and took doge down. Knew I should of sold before."
13667,Doge is trash.
13668,Fucking love you Kevin
13669,Doge is a joke lol sell while you can and buy a coin with utility.
13670,"It is definitely time to stop relying on the tweets of a few people to push the price of Dogecoin. If it is to succeed it needs to succeed on its own merits. If you want it to succeed, reach out to businesses and push for them to accept it. Reach out to service companies like Robinhood etc. and push for them to develop functional wallets. Don't want it to be a hustle? Help put some meat on its bones and make it not a hustle."
13671,Snl sucked big time it was not funny at all.epic fail to have his mom say she didn’t want Doge and then do the doge father skit in the middle of snl after most of the sell off. Wth 🤦🏻‍♀️ Elon did it again
13672,Fuck all these amateurs who sell their shares are the slightest sign of it not climbing. Crypto would be so much stronger if retards who don’t know the first thing about investing would just leave it alone
13673,I thought Elon was funny :)
13674,Instead it dropped to .50 cents
13675,Was done purposely..BS
13676,I waited about an hour for one of my orders to sell
13677,"Who cares doge coin didn’t go to the moon. Elon fucking Musk hosted SNL, and I found it quite funny."
13678,Someone hit the buy button at the exact moment someone hit the sell button on peak. I’m sorry/congratulations.
13679,No.. had nothing to do with snl. If you look at the daily chart. That was expected.
13680,Musk just playing with people getting them to jump in whiles he sells
13681,Kevin still works on Vacation... Meetkevin for governor
13682,Can you do a video on Bonfire and Saturna they look huge 🚀💥
13683,Please slow down with the ads every few seconds
13684,workaholic
13685,"If you trade Doge, kudos to you, hope you made money.. But those of you who are holding Doge.. look at its previous history.. Its all pump and dump! The coin has no fundamentals, no development, and horrible coin distribution. Oh well. Hope yall didnt get hit so hard."
13686,Workaholic 😂
13687,This the first time I felt like saying stfu Kev lol but I bought in at 4 cent I’m up 800% I can’t complain if I’m at 50 cent I’m looking good it goes up to 72 cent that’s gravy on top
13688,"I don't know why you think diamind hands was easy for us? I bought at .06 with 125k coins and was -3,000 in January/ February and March. I held it and bought more on dips. I am 50k in profit. I am hodling until 2025.

New investors think spending $400 in dogecoin today and get rich next week. This will not going to happen. If you want to invest than you have to hold it long term."
13689,"This is the worst youtub channel ever, tons of advertisement and just blablabla"
13690,"Wait, Kevin’s been locked in his house for 12 months and the first place he goes when he’s out is Disneyland...?"
13691,This worlds a joke lol
13692,Kevin is the Man..have a good vacation buddy! Thanks.
13693,Ever heard of buy the rumor sell the news?
13694,"Man, for 1.6M followers, you really know nothing about crypto OR pop-culture. The skits seem scripted? Yeah. It's not called Saturday Night Improv. Actors opted out because of the harsh comments given to them by Elon. Your followers should take warning about your know-nothingness"
13695,People are stupid and get controlled by social media hype lmao
13696,Doge is a joke Kevin!!!
13697,🚀🚀 CAPTAIN COIN 🚀🚀
13698,Hey hey heeeeeey!!!   BITCONNEEEEEEECT!!!
13699,Hey hey heeeeeey!!!   BITCONNEEEEEEECT!!!
13700,I lost $2000 because of coward  investors
13701,"Tesla and Doge....two sides of the same coin. If you're in either, gtfo now."
13702,why does it look like your staying in your nans bedroom?
13703,Webull also had am issue with selling DOGE. I was pissed.
13704,"Buy pre hype, sell at peak hype."
13705,"Elon set up a project for his kids to mine dogecoin, he knows how this coin works.  He's just stating facts and not to be the one responsible for people's lost if they're greedy.  If you support Elon and doge, do the same, mine the doge and use it with a wallet, you're not gonna lose anything"
13706,⭐️A buttcoin like doge should be banned ✔️
13707,Now lets see that money go back into growth stocks.
13708,Been following you for over a year now. This video was one of your dumbest.
13709,Market is manipulated... And modern online trading is going to reveal an expose that truth.
13710,It was cringe 😬
13711,BUY! BUY! BUY!👀👀📉💰💰💵💵📥
13712,Elon was on the whales side and he kind of hinted at it before hand about being cautious. And then magically non of the broker sites worked during the sell off.
13713,Elon messed it up
13714,"""I'm taking a break this weekend"". next day new video is up xD"
13715,News flash: SNL is comedy. Not real news. Millennials are so confused they can't tell reality from fantasy.
13716,"Dogecoin being sabotaged 
https://youtu.be/_KDGaF34M6s"
13717,I’m still in the green with doge but SafeMoon is definitely sounding like a better crypto right now. 🚀
13718,I was prevented from selling
13719,Doge is pure speculation unlike bitcoin
13720,That is why I went to safemoon
13721,Kevin are you actually out having fun?!
13722,SNL not funny?? Say it aint so!
13723,Elon is a manufactured hero. The control structure cant let him fail.
13724,"Wait , you were disappointed with SNL’s scripts just yesterday? 😆 😂 😂"
13725,"Idiot. Doge is, and is supposed to be a joke. Are you f’ing serious?   Robinhood?   13 minutes of my life, gone.  Actually, 4 minutes, unwatchable crap."
13726,i don't get it dogecoin has no supply limit unlike bitcoin who are the morons that don't get this means it can't be used as value storage?
13727,Is Webull and Robin Hood owned by the same people
13728,I didn't watch  knew  it was  coming and the dump was  interesting 🤔
13729,You’re wrong but and hold.
13730,when that mother day joke about doge coin came out it dropped 5 cents. then dropped a penny every minute the show was on lol
13731,"Lol if Elon Musk can’t even make the price of Doge coin increase just by appearing on national television and talking about it then nothing will. 
Doge coin is a shit coin with no use and utility. Analysts warned everyone that it wouldn’t last long. It’s a fad and a lot of stupid people bought into it."
13732,Classic sell the news event. I have zero sympathy for anyone who lost money last night because this exactly happened on dogeday. You had a couple of weeks to buy cheap this snl was first announced. Hopefully many lost and decided to leave the market so we have less dumbass idiots with us
13733,"Doge nation it's time to support the Doge and punish SNL.  They should have done much better. I have not watch SNL for years.  The show was bad with bad acting and bad writing, not even Elon could save it....."
13734,"Doge is a joke, that's the point."
13735,That was embarrassing. Elon owes me money
13736,Robinhood is trash. It's not an accident it stopped working. Robinhood has screwed its users several times to protect its own interests and it will happen again.
13737,"👍

13738,Hustle meant sell now. We're all screwed folks.
13739,Ask Kevin needs to know you couldn`t buy Dogecoin last night either.
13740,Well he is now associated with people losing money. Thanks for killing doge Elon
13741,Kevin u drunk? Lol okkuuurrrrr
13742,Doge is not going to hit a $1.00 anytime soon once he called a hustle it went 📉📉📉📉📉📉
13743,Young man you're flushed . Haha love ya kevin
13744,Why the fk are people buying crypto on Robinhood & Webull ffs! 🤦‍♂️ 😂
13745,"Having googled 'copy Wallter Bulls"" you can find a cool persona. He made a fortune a few years ago. Recently, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of experts. This personage clearly shows how to copy him automatically using such services. We must try while the market is on the rise"
13746,"he is manipulating the market, wherever he wants he raises his fortune by saying few words.He is going to bring the price back, though is it really worth it?"
13747,"Ask Kevin is a first time watcher of SNL... They haven`t had a good skit since,,, actually the fact is they`ve NEVER had a good skit!"
13748,You look crazy w/out ur Beard
13749,The main reason for the crash -Barry Silbert and his minions.
13750,I'M NOT FREAKING SELLING
13751,I think it’s just a buy the rumor sell the news type of thing. Everyone recognizes Doge is a meme coin with really no purpose. They still buy it because it’s funny.
13752,"All of you DOGECOIN hodlers, take your money and put it into real projects guys, enough of this. Want to make gains with a real project? Buy Vechain, you can get 2 VET for your 1 Doge right now. Don’t give up just move into real projects with actual futures."
13753,"Please cashapp me so I can buy more lost my rent money,so stupid of me $Tashaunjosey"
13754,Damn 6 ads on 13 mins Video I guess doge hurt you
13755,I loved the skits
13756,Buy the dip and hold
13757,Same constipated face thumbnail for stupid doge coin and serious country and economic issues. You will never know when this channel has something important to say because the thumbnails are all equally fake concerning.
13758,Robinhood sux!
13759,You have dogde too? Oh man you are in every pos there is in financial markets
13760,I dont think many people are going to buy a Tesla now
13761,He called it a hustle Kevin!
13762,Dont forget the nose sunscreen
13763,Millenials are funny.I stay with index funds
13764,His enjoying this 😂
13765,But wait it dropped wayyyy before... SNL actually started... minutes before... one whale supposedly dropped millions and millions of coins
13766,Let’s all buy more doge to drive it up since snl was a let down!! 🚀
13767,"The Cardano train is leaving the station, see ya never Doge!"
13768,I buy Safemoon 🚀🚀🚀
13769,should i sell or hold i feel like doge aint goin nowhere
13770,Ditch DOGE and board the ADA train!
13771,I blame gen z hospital
13772,Okay great so will growth and small caps come back now? 😂
13773,Come on man you know the run up is always before the day of the event. And if you're still trading crypto on Robinhood then you gave the game away. I took my money out a long time ago (relatively).
13774,Who cares about doge buy safemoon and gmr financial
13775,"I mean we all love money, but for someone with few millions and cry over money makes me sick.  Make more kids and stop making videos.. Jesus your family needs you"
13776,"Weenie baby Kevin think he know everything, but that's how he be getting people money. Punk"
13777,"I want to see crypto offered on all online trading platforms. Especially the major’s. 
Unitl it’s offered on all platforms we will have a limited “market”."
13778,KEV drunky
13779,Hope you had fun at Disneyland Kevin!
13780,It was all hype it was bouned to happen. Same as 420. Doge will go back up. But this time slowly so it doesn't crash hard.
13781,I saw this shit coming. I sold the day before. I never trust planned rallies.
13782,Doge is a hype coin to distract the mass from the real coins
13783,Kevin get some sleep. Doge of course was going to sell off. Sell the news. Doge though sold and laughed at as a joke is no joke ;)
13784,"SNL is not a platform to pump Doge.  You’re taking it way too seriously and need to take a step back. If you’re disappointed by the sketches, it’s because comedy is hard.  Try writing one and you’ll see. Much harder if you’re trying to pump something without alienating the core SNL audience.  Take a deep breath and relax.  You’re on vacation!  😂

I actually thought he was gonna be way more awkward.  Good job Elon! 👍"
13785,If you purchase coin on Webull or Robinhood you do not own it. It is a mistake to purchase on these platforms.  Get a wallet and purchase through crypto exchange. This is the way. $DOGE $SafeMoon
13786,I disagree with your in SNL breakdown brotha
13787,"No, I was trying to buy at .47 an got the same error message for a long time, finally my order went through 30 min later. Everyone an their mother will be buying this low, it went back up to almost 60, just consider this a sale price lol"
13788,Kev is 🔨’d
13789,Bonfire 🔥
13790,How's your Disney shares? 🤔
13791,Enjoy the day off with the fam
13792,Gonna drop to 26c I have a limit buy set lol. That's where it started to get weird
13793,You’ve been praying for this which is the sad part
13794,My guess. Doge folk will sell off and move to Vechain (VET) next.
13795,Maybe something to do with sort-sellers dumping coins onto the market?
13796,"Go to Kraken, leave robinhood."
13797,"The skit was shit!!! Doge has had a parabolic run since the beginning of the year and it’s probably going to cool off for a while! Unless someone with enormous influence expresses a positive opinion about Doge, it’s going to take awhile to get to $1!"
13798,They didn't even show the shiba inu!
13799,"Last night was a shit show. The Doge jokes were lame, the whales started selling off, people began panic selling, Robinhood went down. Rollercoaster? Free falling from the top of the Empire State building sounds more accurate."
13800,Robinhood is PURE CRAP!!!!!  I sold Doge at over 60 cents and it filled at 47 pure crap!!!! I’m completely done with Robinhood Monday morning.  Selling all doge and moving to voyager transferring stocks to webul or think or swim
13801,Did I not warn you about this 48 hours ago?
13802,Doge family let’s stay strong we don’t need a shout out to touch a dollar
13803,Saw this coming a mile away. Same thing happened on Doge Day 420. Doge will be back!
13804,Doge SHOULD be the butt of the jokes.  It is a joke. It won't be around in a year IMO.  It will make a few people rich but offers nothing of substance.
13805,"Oh man for real... I've made a video (in Portuguese so don't need to see it ahahah) talking about this before the SNL. And for me the bulk of 'holders' would sell just before or during the show. 
It looks like it was that!
Great video!"
13806,I could see a lot of people that made some good profit in doge pull out and go into a BTC and Eth
13807,man put a million ads
13808,"Oh Man....On Vacation, getting offended by SNL writers before drifting off.  Just let go....Your family is far more important. SNL has not been funny for a Long Time."
13809,"Hi, I received an email last night for the targeted eidl and it’s giving me steps to complete. One is for irs to release tax info for 2019. Then there are others steps to complete, it says electronic disbursement but I can’t click on that yet I guess until they get the irs info. Can you please explain to me what’s going on? Thank you!"
13810,WRONG WRONG WRONG! THIS VIDEO SUCKS. IM UNSUBSCRIBING THIS DUDE
13811,🚀🚀🚀
13812,Doge is still going down be very careful Robin Hood is NOT allowing people to get out because no one‘s buying Thank me later SELL Now before it’s too late
13813,Doge 6 dollars on 2022 is time to buy more????????
13814,Doge is a joke.  Not a very funny one.  This will end badly with a lot of people losing significant money.
13815,Many of us called that! It was inevitable. If not for an early sell off but the script being from SNL was not going to be pro Doge. Lol Calling it a “hustle” hurt though. Ouch.
13816,"Sir, I would like to thank you 🙏 for taking the time to make this video. It will likely help millions with their anxiety."
13817,Why people still watch this woke SJW show is beyond me. The whole SNL bit was a massive catastrophe
13818,When you grow up you'll laugh about this night.
13819,🌿🌺🌿 Happy Mothers Day Moms!
13820,Fuck SNL I lost 20k man 🤦
13821,The “it’s a hustle” comment was ridiculous!! This was not anticipated do to the positive comments over the past months. Elon Bust screwed a bunch of people!!!!
13822,"doge is a scam i own it and i know that, i took the risk from .61"
13823,Shiba... coin?
13824,🤫move into $ada🤫
13825,Y’all act so surprised that it crashed lmao
13826,Sold my doge for Shiba (The dogecoin killer!)
13827,SNL hasn’t been that great in a long time
13828,I can’t understand why people are so precious about Doge? There are so many other coins that actually have a real use rather then a joke coin? Honestly Doge was never going to make a $1 this round. Was just a line to get people to hold so they can sell before the sell off.
13829,Dude Doge is a joke that has gone on longer than it should.  It doesn’t DO anything but have fans.  SNL was just holding up a mirror.
13830,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
13831,Get out of doge its a bs joke with no use case. If u made money you arena genius but its time to go with something with an amazing use case like vechain
13832,You are obviously not an engineer. The scripts were so funny and Elon was awesome.
13833,snl is completely stupid
13834,I don't think 69 is a real support level.
13835,Lol welcome to the real crypto world....whales determine the price not you
13836,"F*ck Webull, you need to start letting your audience know when trading crypto they screw their users by only filling orders way out of market prices. Buy orders are filled way above Ask price and Sell orders are filled way below Bid price. Its total Bull Sh*t. They should be called WeBullSh*T. Stick with Robinhood folks, only use Webull for the charting. Robinhood is not perfect but they don't screw with the prices like WebullSh*t does."
13837,I felt like Elon wasn't to bad but the regular ppl on SNL are pretty terrible it reminded me why I haven't watched the show in over 10 years
13838,Doge is a joke
13839,SNL is trash - I hope everyone woke up to that fact last night....
13840,"I've lost almost $1000 because of SNL, going to hang myself"
13841,Of course Robinhood blocked the sell of Doge when it wasdropping. Needs to be a lawsuit against robinhood
13842,"Musk will take Doge for Tesla but not until Berlin and Texas is online. Can’t keep up with demand now, so there’s zero need for him to pump demand by saying that."
13843,GameStop short squeezed twice.
13844,safemoon
13845,Buy BTT
13846,"First I thought Elon did a good job talking about Doge, then I rethink and I got piss with Elon saying Doge hussle..but I remember that he made a joke about himself and Tesla....SO “KEVIN TOILET  GOVERNOR...BS TO YOUR SIDE!!"
13847,"We are bleeding and in an emergency level, but dead. Doge will come back."
13848,Thats why l do not use robinhood.... lol
13849,Are you new??? Nothing pumps the day of an event....
13850,"Just like it was supposed to sky rocket on 4/20 , but it didn't. It will bounce back and continue to rise like it has been.  Just don't be like those sissy paper hand weaklings and hold on tight."
13851,"Trypical ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" It was just Doge day all over again"
13852,"Still have Rosetta API and Coinbase listing possibly coming, still have ""Dojo for Doge super computer"" coming, still have Dogecoin on the moon event coming. It's not all doom and gloom, Doge will be ok."
13853,Too the 🌙
13854,"Dogecoin is a trailer park coin sorry.  It makes cryptocurrency a joke, especially the community that buys it.  Eth, ADA, POLY, VECHAIN all solid."
13855,Kevin looks 10yrs younger-Disneyland rlly is the most magical place on earth
13856,"Kevin, why waste your time on doge when you can talk about cryptos that has real fundamental impacts on society. Foe an example Carndo, Vechain. 

Love your vids BTW, 🚀"
13857,There it’s...the Slow bleeding 🩸
13858,Oh so your simple enough to think it crashed from a bad joke?  The joke hadn't happened yet when the crash happened bro. 2 words. Do research. Another 2. Barry Silbert.
13859,Well yeah the scripts  are done ahead that’s how it works
13860,Doge millionaire really thought he'd hit 3 mill😂 he should've sold off before the show 🤦‍♂️
13861,Robinhood straight up freezes. It's not about not filling orders. You can't even cancel your order.
13862,Next for doge is 0
13863,Ads ads ads ads
13864,They even had lucid motor commercials. First I’ve seen.
13865,I want to go to Disney too
13866,Thanks for the video Kev!
13867,Ada  taking Doge money 🚀🚀🚀🚀
13868,You dont usually look like you've lost a bunch of money lol
13869,my brother tried buy at 0.18 cents and robinhood took a day to fill. ended up buying at 0.31 cents.
13870,SnL isn't great either Kevin. It sucks Doge....
13871,"I prefer normal Kevin over ""1950s Boston talk radio Kevin"". I've noticed he kind of shifts between a ""character"" maybe and a more conversational tone. Definitely prefer the conversational tone, just some feedback."
13872,Looks like Kevin been crying about the fall of Doge 🤣
13873,"Hold don’t sell we have support with millionaires, celebrities, big company that has 41k stores will accept doge transactions, Amazon will soon accept doge payment, hedge fund banks are putting billions of dollars if you don’t believe then sell but I’m holding doge has potential"
13874,Dodge coin 6 dollars on 2022 we all gonna see it$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
13875,"EVERYONE BOYCOTT ""SNL"" it turned into a horrible show. They make all the original comedians from the 90's early 2000's look very bad. Ruining there legacy"
13876,My theory is that SNL created a slower burn on the buy side and massive booms on the sell side at coordinated times. I feel this is supported by the rate at which cryptos are able to execute transactions. In most cryptos 7 transactions per millisecond. Visa does 26k per ms this is a signal cryptos are not YET really to be a mainstream transactional currency. These stresser events help advance the technology so thanks SNL/Elon.
13877,Did you think a bunch of elitists would want to help the little man?
13878,Officially one of my favorite youtubers ❤
13879,My wife punched in the face for not selling at 0.73 ahhh jahshdbdjehdbd
13880,Manipulating buying and selling is a felony.
13881,Sell in 0.70
13882,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news."""
13883,SNL blows
13884,When you’re a HOLDLAHHHHH and don’t care if doge hits .70 or .30 because you bought it under a penny. Just holding the bag until my hands get tired one day. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😂
13885,Disney volg any chance
13886,Elon musk is no better then the next billionaire. I thought he was different. He take the average persons last dollar before he would give them a penny. Thought he was for helping people he tricked us just to add to his billions.
13887,I'm not a sellout
13888,*If ya didn’t learn anything from the 4/20 so called hype then this DOGE and crypto in general might not be for you.... just stick to the BTC and ETH of the world and play it safe*
13889,I'm so glad I don't have real money invested in this
13890,HOLD Strength No WEAKNESS
13891,oh yeah you are talking about fundamental investing buhaahahha you are this type of investor buahahah man you are talking to teenagers and people without any financial knowledge base on comments here your channel is an evidence that in usa most people know nothing about economic
13892,SNL is horrible
13893,"people sold, in anticipation of a big spike. Let the weak leave and the true futurist will prevail!"
13894,I sold at .70 yesterday. Saw this coming a mile away. It was the same with doge day. Pump early sell off at the “trigger”
13895,Dogecoin has no use value. FOMO'ers deserved to get rekt
13896,Money going to ETC
13897,Kevin could of made half a milli if he didn't sell on the first run up
13898,SNL stunk. Elon messed up. I know Whos the whale.
13899,"checking in, reporting for duty, MBUD or bust"
13900,Who is stupid enough to still use Robin Hood? The Game Stop fiasco didn't teach you that Robin Hood will screw its users to benefit the banks? IDIOTS! Just switch to reputable brokerage. Time to remove the baby training wheels and move to a legitimate platform.
13901,Check Trias it's mooning 🤑🚀🚀
13902,SNL is junk now. It was great in the 90s.
13903,"SNL lost its way by hiring nothing but Ivy League, woke, safe space actors and writers.  Nothing they do is comedy anymore.  The minute that virtue signaling takes over, I tune out."
13904,"I sold dogecoin at 0.66, a few moments before the fall."
13905,I just bought at .05 sold at $.68 suckers what’s funny is all the whales are buying up the bitcoin you sold to buy doge
13906,Woke up. Lost $300
13907,Hey how come you have a beard one day and other day than you have no beard.
13908,Doge has always been a joke. Wtf.
13909,Shut the FUCK UP!!!
13910,I guess doge really is a joke.
13911,If the price of an investment is based on a snl  skit then I would worry about the fundamentals of that investment.
13912,AMC 🚀
13913,"So, the whales sold more DOGECOIN.
Nothing new.
As soon as they drive the price down to where they want it, the whales will buy back in.
That will send the price skyrocketing back up.
And all the nervous nellies who panic sold will begin buying back in.
All this did was create yet another buying opportunity.
DOGECOIN still has tremendous upside, and I won't be surprised to see it hit $10 by the end of this year.
The party ain't over, till it's over."
13914,It’s pain man
13915,Doggy coin did start as a joke did it not?
13916,Come on Kevin! We all know that anything on tv is scripted propaganda. Its all built in.
13917,WETHEMMOONBUDDIES LFG
13918,Im Not F..cking Selling !!!
13919,easy come easy go damn it
13920,"<<< Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crpto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mcknight Lisa  program, an establishment that  handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Lisa  can be reached on 🆃🅴🅻🅴🅶🆁🅰🅼@ {McKnightlisa}"
13921,People still watch SNL?
13922,It’s so funny watching people see an SNL episode for the first time.
13923,CITADEL is pumping DOGE on RH so all the GME AMC APES head that way. Do a video on this. When will CITADEL gets Fock??\
13924,Same exact thing happened to me. Took screenshots shots. I am sold my doge at .60 then wanted to buy back in. Set an order to buy back at .50 then changed my mind and  Couldn't cancel my buy order at .50 cents. Robinhood is a scam
13925,"As usual, SNL sucked!  That show hasn't been good for a LONG time..."
13926,imagine not having a day off in 15 months Kevin2024
13927,Kevins wasted probably shouldn’t do wasted videos if you’re going to run for governor dog
13928,So the coin will not go up now?
13929,"Haha I love seeing DOGE crash, I enjoyed shorting it last night."
13930,More people sell during a dip
13931,Reminds me of CCIV when they confirmed.....
13932,I think you might be wrong it usually shoots up a few days later
13933,"Doge lovers: The coin has uses! It's fundamentals are tight! There is adoption!

Also doge lovers: We rely on a tech giant who has no actual connection to the coin to pump it."
13934,Oh Dogecoin 🥺
13935,"Woke up this morning, seeing I lost $6000."
13936,I couldn’t buy any yesterday. Weird
13937,SNL hasn't been funny in a decade
13938,"This is why I think Kevin would be good in government. Even when he's on vacation he thinks about the ""little people"" his followers and stops to take the time to make a video for us. This is a character trait not many of any government officials have these days. Thanks Kevin you got my vote!!"
13939,Buy crypto at crypto exchanges and you will have no problem with selling.
13940,Haha
13941,Much thanks Elon -$200 and dropping return he needs to just keep his ass on Twitter
13942,I'm more inclined to buy Doge than ever. I will just wait a week for this SNL thing to die off.
13943,Sad😂😂😂
13944,I expected about a 30% dip so I’m going to buy more come Monday morning. I think they’ll be another “buy the rumor” in another month or two.
13945,"see this everywhere today, lookin guud"
13946,Crypto are beenie babies not currency
13947,Ethereum Classic turn
13948,Meet Kevin You need to make a trading platform app. I am done with all these huge companies taking advantage of us. You for the ppl. Let's go. I will follow you. :)
13949,I thought SNL got canceled in the 1990s. It must be a really crappy show these days. I never hear about it . Lol
13950,You don’t watch SNL.  It’s been horrible sitcom for 20 years.  How they survive   Who knows. ?
13951,Robinhood is a joke. Glad I never used that exchange.
13952,Fck Molly Cyrus too talk about ZERO talent !!
13953,Doge is a joke
13954,EM has become a loser
13955,"Fck dogecoin and yall full of shit, just making all these BS videos to hustle money from YouTube. Fuck you Elon Musk you scumbag"
13956,I was not able to sell. Glad I just had some play money in Doge. If not I would be livid. Plus all the possibly new investors may never invest due to last night's disaster.
13957,"$Doge is *cornered*, I dont get youtubers not mentioning it! Its 688 wallets that hold 80% of all Doge."
13958,Lol! Big joke
13959,Stop using Robinhood!!
13960,You are my hero.
13961,I put everything i had in to this coin because i believed but mostly i felt that im lowest in life financially that i ever been so i went all in because im desperate now i lost my ass. Im struggling with this
13962,I was hoping he would joke about how people need to get out of doge. It's over everyone.  It's just another coin and probably more volatile and more likely to crash drastically.  Anyone getting in above .50 is asking to hold the bag and hopefully just gambling money.
13963,"My cell order happened immediately, on Robinhood."
13964,The show has sucked for years
13965,"Sorry 
I sell all 63000 coin at .66 
I won"
13966,The concerns I have is doge is dogshit and how many people are willing to fomo in on something cause everyone else is. Great for those who have made money but a lesson those who think they’re gonna get rich loading up on some nonsense they know nothing about.
13967,You look sick grow your beard back out man
13968,Safemoon and Spore are poised to make moves!
13969,Dogecoin... I Believe
13970,market cap ?
13971,I guess no dollar eh?..lmao!!
13972,Exited dogecoin before the show. Just didn't make sense for dogecoin being worth more than tether.
13973,"I think we all just got ""hustled"""
13974,Price goes down I buy more! Don’t let a little speculation dump scare you guys!!
13975,Bro ain't you on vacation go be with your family we'll see you Monday lmaooo
13976,I hope Doge goes back to $0.01 where it belongs.
13977,Hang in there! 🐕 have some faith 🪙 ! To Mars! 🚀
13978,It was a big scam... Elon even warned us not invest our life savings 😉. Sold at 73 cents I’m about to go shopping good luck holding on to dogecoin. RIP DOGE
13979,You don't look so well! When was your last covid test bro?🤔
13980,Is this the first time Kevin saw SNL? Is all he think it was was a Elon doge pump? Stop dreaming Kevin. SNL is shit.
13981,Facts that ish sucked
13982,Dude are you drunk!
13983,AMC TO THE MOOON!!!
13984,Upvote for more Drunk Kevin market live streams
13985,hodl or nah 🤦🏽‍♂️😭🤷🏽‍♂️
13986,Webull cancel 15x my order
13987,"SNL was great! Me thinks ur expectations were too high. The whole tongue-in-cheek goal of SNL is to poke fun and garner laughs. They did both. Elon was great. Announcing he has Asperger's in the beginning was brilliant. Lorne did a wonderful job of writing skits that Elon was comfortable in and I think a huge success! Anyone placing hopes and dreams on an SNL appearance is misguided. Doge has no explanation, so, was he to make something up to appease the masses? Love ya Kevin, but, think u missed the mark here."
13988,"honestly who actually thought a coin, an abandoned project,  with a dog on it and inflates by 15 million  coins a day , roughly 5 billion a year was going to be the next world currency? 🤣 🤣 🤣"
13989,Couldn’t watch this video ; I’m on vacation
13990,And that is why I’m not holding doge.
13991,Elon Musk wtf
13992,People are panic selling their dogecoin...  I'm not selling mine because this happened before when it's value fell and then skyrocket few months later.
13993,Dude what’s your cash app I’m tired of that jacket
13994,LFG
13995,Stupid scriptwriter of SNL made the dogecoin go down by joking negatively about dogecoin.
13996,SNL is just horrible.  Its unwatchable. It has nothing to do with Musk its the writing and the actors. Jumped the shark years ago.
13997,"Bro, this guy on vacation 😂🤣😂🤣"
13998,"It is a joke. You expected SNL, one of the worst shows still on TV, to push doge, one of the worst coins in the space, to somehow make this inflationary coin worth a dollar? You're better than this.

At the time of ""writing this,"" doge is .4486. So."
13999,I told ppl elon wasn't going to say shit good about doge coin don't no why everybody be so hype when he speak i knew this was going to be bad for doge elon be playing with ppl emotions and i don't blame him with how stupid ppl are so easily to control
14000,Crypto clueless
14001,I think it was a lot of people just trading it for the news. BUY the DIP....BUY the DIP.....LALALALA.
14002,Rh crashed at the moment I was going to sell and in turn I've lost $- almost 3k I think they should be held responsible and pay back or credit people on there loss at that point they definitely need to be investigated like coin seed was
14003,Elon literally warned ya'll lol
14004,"Holding doge, this is just a minor setback, this isn’t the first time with doge! Doge to the moon let’s go!!"
14005,FOMO… I think most of the investor is a newbie like me and just put in the basket because it was a trendy and everybody talking about Dogecoin. I hope you and all influencer can approach and convince us to HOLD for a long term investment. I love Doggy as well Dogecoin and l believe Dogecoin is our future.. for students and all human in this planet…xoxo
14006,"This was a replay of CCIV / Lucid (I was a diamond hander 🥲), slow bleed here we come."
14007,"Remember when SNL was funny.....sadly Pepperidge farms remembers.
Dogecoin to the moon, Alice!"
14008,"Vaca videos !!!!  Enjoy , have fun and bring us with you!"
14009,Go enjoy your vacation. Jeez. Doge can wait. Lol
14010,"Elon the puppet,Way to sign up to act for the opps,I knew this shit as gunna fail."
14011,I think he just wanted to get a better cost basis
14012,We will get Tesla will accept doge before the next crash ! But begining next week it’s all gonna be rumors !!!
14013,Satalite reveal with connection with dogecoin and Elons super computer and Amazon and Robinhoods separate wallets. Just one of those anousements will shoot it past 75 cents
14014,Well I took out my principal plus 200% profit out 1 month ago
14015,SNL still has an audience? News to me.
14016,Doge deserves to be right back at 1 penny and that's generous
14017,Doge is garbage
14018,"Elon mom: “I am so excited that it is not Doge!”
Elon: “yes it is “!!!!
Kevin He didn’t say No ! But that is why Doge went down because rich people buy presents only if they are on sale !!!! I know riches mentality !!!!"
14019,No no Robinhood did me dirty
14020,Show was ass!!! Who tf watches that
14021,All drops were caused by Bitcoin! Just right now!!
14022,Diamond hands here I'm in it for the big haul...
14023,"Look at the Brighter side... Elon Musk will use your DogeCoin to colonize Mars. 
At least not all is wasted."
14024,Where's the beard ?
14025,"Watched it. Cringe was when the newscaster said, So its a hustle"", and Elon nodded in agreement ""To the Moon!"""
14026,"It needs to go to zero, that's all it's worth."
14027,"Bunch of whales taking profit, paper hand traders, scalpers, and panic sellers. Buy the dip and HODL to $1."
14028,Sell sell sell
14029,bonfire!!!!! got my money 🚀🚀only in 2 days!!🤑
14030,#DUMPDOGE
14031,Kevin sounds weird. Sore throat?
14032,"I used to love SNL back in the 90’s n after last night I seen I haven’t missed anything since then lol I couldn’t even watch everything..thank goodness for ff options 😂😂
Im still keeping the little Doge I have but sold a little at .70"
14033,ELON WARNED EVERYONE. AND ALSO IN THE PAST TO US BASICALLY HODL. WHY WOULD THEY MENTION IT ON SNL AND THEN DROP IT? SIMPLE. TO PICK UP NEW BUYERS. STOP BLAMING ELON. HE TOLD YOU TO HOLD AND HE WARNED YOU BEFORE SNL. WHY PROMOTE IT AND THEN DROP IT? THINK.
14034,Robinhood crypto is not available in a lot of countries that webull is available
14035,"Lol buy the rumor, sell the news"
14036,Is your $DOGE sick? Take it to the $VET. VeChain.
14037,"Buy the hype, sell the news. Always."
14038,SNL hasn’t had a decent “script” for decades!  Enjoy Disneyland—don’t work today 🎉
14039,Binance in Europe has no problem to fulfill my order ! It’s only in the US the riches don’t want the poor to buy the dips on Doge !!!! In two weeks it will be +100%! Lol
14040,"Please spread this out! 
The dogecoin got massively sold off becoz of the SCAMMER stole ppl's dogecoin, by using ""donate and get 2x return back"" during the time of SNL. Many investors fell for that scam"
14041,Omgosh.. l almost dont recognized you.. you look more younger and look innocents..LoL…xoxo
14042,SNL has been a disappointment for a whole lotta years 🤣😂
14043,He basically screwed us over
14044,Go with binance
14045,This dogecoin is gonna be worse than GameStop .. it’s gonna coming down
14046,Snl has sucked for 15 years now
14047,Stop hatin on Doge
14048,bag hodlers!! :))
14049,"why bother with dogecoin? just go to casino and bet it all on red , you get your results much faster"
14050,Worst case scenario is they are performing arbitrage on their customers. 25 minute wait when crypto exchanges are getting immediate sell and buy orders is suspicious to say the least. We have already seen slimy tactics on RobinHoods part to make a buck so I wouldn’t put it past them.
14051,LMAOOOOO BAGHOLDERS WEEEPPPP!
14052,"gee, you mean a tv show well past its prime with subpar, politically childish actors didnt pump our fave coin? Say it aint so.  Expectations were far too high for this"
14053,The fact that peole are shocked and mad  that DOGE did not pump and go to the moon over and SNL skit is amazing.  Special guest Elon Musk on SNL followed by REKT city.  Shame on you all for expecting otherwise...
14054,It wasn't SNL. It was a whale dumpathon which started before the show aired. Then everyone else panicked and sold. SNL definitely didn't help though. Lol.
14055,Robynhood selling their own dogecoin ahead of the platforms users.
14056,Making up your own currency is kinda like making up your own religion.
14057,This will remove the reliance upon Musk for Dogecoin Growth. So this is a good thing Doge will slingshot back up and pass $1 just give it time. Institutions are still adopting dogecoin as a currency. You can now earn interest on gemeni for doge.
14058,indeed
14059,You Tricked us with the beard in the thumbnail
14060,"Getting flooded with emails from scam coins looking for promotion. Be careful out there guys! Loads of bad actors looking to take the money from your pocket and put it in theirs!….It's crazy when you realise Eth is no longer $500. I see my trqding profits these days and i wonder, why so much money and so few coins I am so used to $10,000 Bit coin  and $300-500 Eth, i am still not used to these new amazing prices. I use to have so many coin but my portfolio wasn’t growing Elliottrades change the narration of my cryptostory, all this changed when I encountered Elliottrades., although I have been into numerous services but Elliot Wainman stands out with experienced expertise in the field. I must confess it wasn't an easy task learning the routes on trading but with his assisstance I earrned a lot, His  Ͳҽ  Iҽ ցɾ ąʍ @ elliotradezcrypto"
14061,"The whole thing went EXACTLY as i predicted (poor SNL performance, Elon having no acting skills, and Doge falling atleast 33%)
Why is anyone surprised ?"
14062,You only lose if you sell 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎🖐🖐
14063,yeah the show is garbage.  Elon's monologue was decent. had a couple laughs. the OJ lines were pretty laugh out loud dark funny which I really loved.  but SNL as a show has spiraled into obscurity over the past couple decades since the sandler-rock-spade-farley years.  it's pretty telling when the funniest cast member of the past 15 years was Shane Gillis - the comic they fired 72 hours after announcing he was hired for last season due to his dark funny stuff he has said on comedy podcasts in the past.  but SNL's major claim to fame recently is they fired the only funny comic they had 3 days after hiring him.. and one of the other cast members is currently f***ing scarlet johansson.
14064,Kevin where is your beard!?
14065,When you get to social and media technical analysis you are now the everything store of u tube.     And yet. Kevin can do it.    This is the best of controlled manic energy.  And that Includes stable but hyper activity.      Waiting for the market analysis w lap top  at the top of the Mattahorn or on space mountain  🎢 .    😁😁
14066,"Currently at .38
Not a slow bleed, this is a bloodbath"
14067,Oh well buy more
14068,Buy on rumor sell on news ! Elon told yesterday he will buy some doge for his mom birthday ! He certainly will when doge would be -60% on sale ! And kaboom doge crashed ! It all makes sense!! But don’t worry in 2 weeks doge will be +100%!!!
14069,"I should’ve sold, I should’ve trust my instincts and sold. Knew it was coming 🤢"
14070,No the whales pumped and dumped. For them it was a very good deal. The small people feed the canons. Invest in OMI. Thats real!!!
14071,I don’t think it went as bad as people think. Lol but we shall see
14072,Go enjoy your vacation with your family
14073,Never trusted robinhood and still don’t trust robinhood. I wouldn’t be surprised if this company fall like Enron.
14074,Joke: Technical Analysis of a joke. 😁 come on kev do better than that talk about real coins. Millionaires don't mess with projects that are entertainment
14075,SNL has not been funny for a long time.
14076,This dude Kevin is fucking hilarious. Bro will make a YouTube video based on anything finance literally anywhere.
14077,"The same thing happened to me. They sold my shares like 15 min later..I thought the same thing. They let us buy but not sell... everything that was said was made to look like Doge was a joke.  I don't think any SNL skits are made without thought, especially in the polarized climate where in currently. That skit was a set up! I switched to fidelity because of the March freeze up with Robin hood. They are obviously still the same and won't change..Why do they need for when they have so much money and don't have live customer service. I love the colors on Robinhood and how easy it is to but I wana speak to a person If I have a problem with my money.."
14078,"I lost money yesterday when doge tanked and my Robinhood app wouldn't work. Tried selling at .65, wouldn't let me."
14079,"There was 0% chance doge would pump after SNL, most obvious peak euphoria in the history of the multiverse"
14080,"SNL - really I mean really poor script writing. Let's bring in New talent and hire some new story writers. Elon did really well even with those poor scripts. 
But expecting Doge to move because of this stupid show is plain stupid."
14081,Continue to buy especially while DOGECOIN is on sale right now
14082,"địt mẹ Elon, chúng ta đều là những con lừa hahah"
14083,it's not SNL's job to help ignorant Robinhood investors with their crypto that they do not understand.
14084,"Pumping doge kills your credibility, Gov'nor Weenie Baby 🤡🤡🤡"
14085,Lol this doge support is some of the most irresponsible content for your viewers ;)
14086,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
14087,safe the doggos
14088,"Check out SHIB, Shiba Inu Coin."
14089,Look at it now....
14090,Went exactly how I expected
14091,The Samething happened during the April 20th hype. People expected 0.69$ on April 20th but it crashed to 0.22 levels before it went back up to break 0.42 and 0.69 in just 2 weeks.
14092,Shiba Inu
14093,Thanks Kevin
14094,"I sold out just now, went from +1900 to 1000, ffffff cya."
14095,buy and hold dogecoin! only idiots are selling now....
14096,HOLD!
14097,OTC
14098,Also 0.69 was the resistance not the support. No one was trying to buy at 0.69$ instead there were tons of sell orders at 0.69$ people trying to make few bucks on doge.
14099,Just gotta keep holding until $10.00
14100,"I know one thing many people watched Saturday night live.  I enjoyed the show.  When you rely on hype,  famous people and poorly run companies to invest in. Well you might as well dig a hole and throw your money in. Don't build your house on sinking land!"
14101,"You wonder if the scripts were premade?  I'll save you the suspense... SNL is scripted... they don't make everything up on the fly.  It isn't ""Whose Line..."""
14102,"THESE DAYS IF YOU'RE NOT SPENDING TO RECOVER,THEN STOP SPENDING ?"
14103,You sound like Justin Trudeau.
14104,One guy having so much power over the price is a real issue
14105,All of my stock pickers that I follow are shilling crypto now. I think a lot of the stock market money from our fave growth stocks is now in crypto. I personally got fed up and sold a portion on my stocks in order to buy more crypto. Because my crypto account has tripled since October and my stocks have gone down 50%.
14106,It was so bad...
14107,This happens when Investing in a big plate of nothing.
14108,I always say with trendy investments to sell the morning of or night before the biggest anticipated events. People always sell off right before the major expected events.
14109,Thanks for taking the time on your vacation to give us an update! That’s awesome of you
14110,You better go look again because it’s crashing right now well you got one hand up Mickey skirt this thing is tanking

Elon musk definitely doesn't give two shits about you.
They are all the same ppl"
14113,That's the face of a guy who just lost A LOT of money
14114,"I dont care, i'm still holding!!"
14115,Love this content. Thank you for all you do.
14116,Anyone who invest in Dogecoin is just dumb. I bought in at 1 penny and sold at 70 cents. Doge was a short term way to make money. It will never reach a $1. I understood that and got out. Invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum for thIs bull run.  Anything else is just a rookie mistake.
14117,Love you brotha!
14118,Yes crypto's are pyramid schemes. Funny it took some people so long to figure this out.
14119,Buy Ethereum Classic and hold get in now before 200$
14120,"SNL has been ""not great"" for over 10 years now. This is the first episode I've watched in about as long."
14121,"Not your keys , not your crypto .... Stop buying derivatives for crypto"
14122,"I don’t get why ppl use robinhood , why not use binance or coinbase , the proper digital currency exchange"
14123,Stop buying crypto on stock market exchanges!!!! Buy on coinbase/coninbase pro these stock market exchanges just trying to hedge with your money buy adding crypto to their platform lol 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂 stock market dying
14124,It’s .44 now.   I’m more disappointed on how terrible Saturday night live is now it’s completely unwatchable not one of those people are funny it’s time to pull the plug on that show
14125,Why is everyone expecting it to pump? Like it’s a GME situation with retail thinking it’ll moon out of nowhere lmao holding 43000 doge at .02 here 😂
14126,SNL: still not funny
14127,I wasn't watching that shit from the jump now I'm losing money fuck elon musk
14128,"I called it!!!   Doge hype is dead, Shiba Inu is now the king.  Doge is now ruined officially by elon, he should just had stayed with his tweets.  Wy buy now just do a 2x, there other great projects that can do 10x,. This Doge because a market distraction"
14129,Boycott Tesla
14130,The suits can’t handle watching the little guy have a run no matter how insignificant
14131,"Chill out on the commercials, there's a commercial every 2 minutes"

14133,Enjoy your vacation!
14134,"Who cares, APE IN NOW"
14135,Pleb
14136,Lmao doge is a meme coin no real purpose true crypto traders invest into bitcoin etherum chainlink polka dot cardano
14137,"In a year doge won’t even be a thing 
I’ve been saying all along it’s 
Dog shit"
14138,Hopefully people can flip their profits into a deflationary digital asset. Doge is a joke for so many reasons.
14139,Buy. The. Dip.
14140,Bonefire is rising tho
14141,Fuck yeah Kevin
14142,Lol something with no value drop
14143,How can there be billions of trades on thousands of stocks Monday-Friday and these platforms seemingly run seamless but they can’t handle one crypto
14144,"brah, doge is perfectly fine. If it didnt let off steam I would be more worried than this. It just dipped from 42ish to like 15 just like days ago. So from 72 is to 40ish is normal. U gotta learn crypto more bro. SNL was all good."
14145,I would say explaining crypto is the equivalent to explaining paper money to someone who only has known a barter economy.
14146,Irony of ironies- socual comedy about a crypto comedy
14147,I miss the beard
14148,Scripts have sucked for years. It’s political and not comedy
14149,"It's a Financial Risk That SNL isn't trying to take. Paper Hands Sell Because we dont need you anyway, Diamond Hands Baby! 💎🌱🚀"
14150,"Lol even with the SNL dive, I am only in gains right now because I sold off my initial investment a while back, so I'm riding this roller coaster risk free. Originally bought between 2-4 cents each lol."
14151,Its not the skits. the Show is not that great
14152,ETC WILL TAKE OVER! 📈📈📈
14153,"Play stupid games (buy doge) win stupid prizes( get rekt thinking a comedy show talking about a meme coin is going to pump your bag)

Now that you’ve learned your lesson buy into real coins with real use case"
14154,sell doge or lose it all !
14155,Kevin ain't drunk. He has heat stroke.
14156,"again, DOGE NEVER has t o go above $1, the best tradable investment with the DIPS. 25 % GAINS IN 1 DAY"
14157,Elon is scaring the whales out period get ready guys
14158,That guy robinhood need to go to jail.
14159,"I loved the episode, Elon did great. Very clever skits playing off Elon's uniqueness."

14165,it was dumping before that... looking for an entry level
14166,Butt of the joke because it is a joke
14167,I rate the stupidity of the USA on how much 🐕 coin goes up ill be 👀
14168,It reminded me immediately why I don't watch SNL anymore
14169,I lost my money in the stock market
14170,Kevin is gambling with DOGCOIN? Come on Kevin. Invest in fundamentals and not a meme.
14171,"Excuse my Norwegian, but... WHO THE FUCK accepts 20 minutes to fill a market taker order? I mean, it's understandable if it's a limit order, but wtf???"
14172,"Thumbnail: 🧔 
Actual video: 👶"
14173,"I love your content mr kevin, your a awesome smart guy, but i have to respectfully disagree with the SNL being totally negative. I think its a good thing that he said “to the moon” in his glasses and good that it was mentioned at all. I guess you can look at it both ways."
14174,"I think the saying goes, “Buy the hype, sell the news.”"
14175,"I don't think it's wise to blame Musk for pushing Doge down, when institutional traders were literally lining up to short the thing. In fact, I think he did a _service_ to all retail investors, who has now learned the hard way that nothing is a sure thing in the trading world. In any case I don't think there's much to worry about. The biggest Doge wallet of them all is still accumulating: DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L"
14176,Elon musk is a piece of shit
14177,"Kevin, are you at wilderness lodge"
14178,So basically all you have to do is invest in a stock before it goes viral?
14179,Dogcion is nothing he go to 1 cent
14180,Bro go be with your family lol
14181,I disagree. But then I didn't have high hopes for SNL in the first place. It's not as good as it used to be in its heyday. I still think Musk's portrayal of the CEO of SpaceX was stellar. Oscar next?
14182,"Investing after it’s already up thousands of percent is pretty stupid given this coin mints 10,000 every few minutes ."
14183,I don't even watch SNL... glad I didn't stay up for that.
14184,Bonfire crypto will be next....
14185,Doge coin is a classic pump and dump scheme if your not the one pumping your probably the one getting dumped on.  Stop chasing get rich quick schemes and every hyped stock or crypto out their.
14186,Hopefully the whales pull out
14187,All pump and dumps...
14188,Nah man the show sucked
14189,Easy .... citadel needed to front run the traffic to make money.....come on kev....why I never touched dogecoin....
14190,Fuck dogecoin you fomo idiots

14192,MoonBud to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
14193,"Doge IS a joke. Don’t you get it yet?!  Please, Go spend time with your family."
14194,Elon Musk would have been better off not going on SNL IMO and in consideration of my investment..why would he make negative references about Doge after bigging it up for months?? I smell a rat. Apparently too may would have come up. This would have been a true revolution. Come on Jeff!
14195,RIP DOGE
14196,but those eyelashes ...
14197,🌖 MOONBUD to the MOON 🚀🐕
14198,thats the most predicted in all of crypto. The people that still falls for it are morons.
14199,"I went from 200% gain, then robinhood screwed me, turned it into 0 gains. Literally back at breakeven. This sucks."
14200,"Elon was a better actor than the normal cast. And every time miley performed DOGE dropped... 
DOGE also dropped hard when they did the doctor skit and made fun of the new language kids these days use..."
14201,🌖 MOONBUD 🐕
14202,"Those cast members who refused to be part of this show did so because Elon is “super rich” and these liberal idiots said they refused to work with someone that rich.  
Which itself is quite rich, since their fucking boss, Disney, who owns nbc, is pretty fucking rich as well.  

These ppl are the worst.  The sooner society realizes this, the better.   The left has lost its collective mind."
14203,Didn't watch it...but I haven't watched it since the original cast when they had real humor and not a political agenda
14204,I think Kevin's drunk or sleepy or both? 😂 😂 😂 Enjoy ur vacay!!
14205,Your ears are very red. How much you lost on dogecoin mate?
14206,"lol @ noobs still trading on robinhood,  let alone buying a shit coin like doge, and not immediatley getting rid of it as sonn as you profitted, lmao noobs will be noobs"
14207,"This is good for the market. Doge is a joke, as is SNL."
14208,All Maye had to say was that I hope it's Dogecoin. To the moon baby.
14209,"Doge was pumping. SNL writes scriptS. Soon as his mom said she hopes she doesn’t receive  doge for Mother’s Day it tanked .

I feel like the writers set him up because some of them don’t like his tweets or political beliefs"
14210,"When you buy it works fine, but when you wanted to sell they wouldn’t let you 🙄"
14211,It’s true I try to sell I couldn’t do it...
14212,I wanna give Elon’s mom a back massage for Mother’s Day since she don’t want no Doge.
14213,"Crypto ""fudamentals""😂🤣😂"
14214,Its just stopping for a charge..
14215,Robinhood doesn't sell crypto...they only let people speculate on price ..legit exchanges allow you to send and receive crypto.. Robinhood is the ONLY exchange I have seen is literally ripping ALL of their customers off
14216,Dodge detour to hell negative 30% as I speak 50 cent  hahaha I told these fools
14217,Robinhood sounds like a scam....keeping people from being able to make thier own decisions.
14218,"Thanks for the more informative videos on Dogecoin oppose to those making videos to gloat or just for clout! People need information on how to stay invested or not!. Very refreshing, I’m holding btw! ☺️

14221,🔥BONFIRE! 🔥
14222,"The pump happened before SNL, $0.70 was it"
14223,also doge coin is an inefficient crypto with transactions speeds slow as turtles. add that plus a ton of orders you get slow buy and sells
14224,Doge still a joke😂 not real utility
14225,"Nah man, it was pumped on the news of SNL. There was no way it would run with so much time knowing this event is coming."
14226,I tried to buy and it was pending for a while. The SNL skits wasn't bad.  It was meant to be funny and it was. We didn't get the spike we wanted but praying it comes eventually. I'm holding! #dogetothemoon 🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕
14227,"This is why you Buy on Rumor / Hype, Sell on News!"
14228,Hardest worker on the internet! Long live Kevin! Long live the Doge💎
14229,Thank you Kevin
14230,ADA 🚀🚀🚀
14231,Lol he didn't think twice making a video about this crap 🤣 fraud
14232,"Doge is a old project ment to be a joke. It has 12 main holders and one of them own 30% (killer whale 🐋). There are plenty of crypto to invest in, and if you want to gamble there is even alt coins. If your scared and want to just put your savings somewhere to survive the inflation, you can always use a combo of crypto and stocks. So please people stop with the Doge."
14233,Paper hands never prosper
14234,Fuck Dogecoin to death!
14235,"🤗 🌈I thought SNL was funny and Elon was extremely funny, I was laughing 😆 so hard - then I checked my DOGE account ... 😬.  I didn’t think DOGE was the butt of the joke.  I think it was manipulated once again by a large institution.-  I still have my DOGE COIN!  Not going to consider selling till I 30,000x my profit.  😁👍🌈"
14236,"SNL is garbage show thats why it tanked, just like SNL's ratings 😂"
14237,LMFAO…ppl still using Robinhood ???? SERIOUSLY ???
14238,"l recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get person who invested with her 
comment below"
14239,Saw that coming🤬🤬🤬
14240,SNL always sucks.   A d why would degecoin be on snl
14241,"When he gave that Dog to his mother he literaly gave up every responsibility from his person...smart move from smart guy who looks like loving son...nobody can blame him,this hype was trap from beggining"
14242,SNL hasn't been good for 15 years.. shocked anyone watched it.
14243,I think musk doesn't care if people lose their shirts.  Feel sad for people who fomo'd at the top and new to crypto.   They probably fear panicked and lost tons of money.
14244,"Not sure which was worse, the Doge crash or the SNL content."
14245,Crypto is not traditional stock. Can’t use same analysis.
14246,April 20 & SNL = No Help
14247,Come on Maye. Enjoy your Doge.
14248,"LOTS of us made money, doge still got big talks of use lol ppl are tripping after buying at .70 lol yall didn't bitcoin before huh? 😆 

Snl is radical liberal trash... they worship govt... crypto in general sticks it to the govt... you expected it to be a huge doge commercial?  🤣 it was name recognition, and it'll pay off just wait. Bitcoin BLEW up and TANKED soooo many times and started at pennies. I suggest doing DD on doge, its not a bad crypto at this point, it'll be fine imho."
14249,The inability to sell is because you are selling derivatives of crypto on Robin Hood and they likely didnt have sufficient liquidity to cover the sales that were going on
14250,"If any part of your investment thesis involves Elon Musk going on SNL and pumping a fake crypto currency he's made a fortune talking you into buying, you have a bad thesis"
14251,Doge is trash.
14252,I don't get why so many people had hope in this coin??
14253,They played your minds. Had safe moon before the whale jumped in. He needed mother's day gift lol
14254,Homie bought the doge high and we saw whales sell he went straight to the adult bar in Disney land I sold at 70 hope y’all see secured
14255,Enjoy your vacation my friend!
14256,I bought at 0.62 but it’s only 100 coins. 😂
14257,kevin still using the same thumbnail even after shaving the beard
14258,"Most people don't understand the concept of "" buying the dip "" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down . Holding is profitable , although trading is far more profitable . I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough , but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Keaton Jasson services., although i have been into numerous services but Keaton Jasson stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Keaton it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel - gram ( @KeatonExpert ) for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns..."
14259,"Your disappointed cuz I think you were anticipating like some type of reassurance from Musk to buy dogecoin. Fact is Musk is rich, he doesn't give a fuck he can be saying dogecoin this week and some other bullshit next week."
14260,"The reason they take so long to fill is because that are trying to lock in a better price for themselves during the crash. So they profit off your sell off. 

STOP TRADING ON ROBINHOOD! THEY ARE TOOLS OF THE HEDGIES!"
14261,Buy the rumor sell the news
14262,Elons mother has class and obviously knows DOGESHITCOIN is crap
14263,SNL hasn't had a good script in 35 yrs.
14264,Hey I love your show I love you but I don't take you as a type of person to have any Dogecoin. So either you have Dogecoin or your pandering and either way just doesn't feel like you Kevin
14265,Imagine making investment decisions based on SNL skits
14266,Thanks for faking us .
14267,I don’t know how Robinhood survived the GameStop manipulation.
14268,Sounds like ur wifi or phone
14269,"You still found time to shoot a video??
You’re the man! Enjoy your vacation with your family."
14270,Lost everything
14271,Why would anyone watch snl crap ? In fact why would any one go to the evil world of Disney ? 🤨
14272,"Doge millionaire guy still has 1mil and Living With Luci probably dropped from 2-1 mil to 900k 

More coins back on the market they’ll be back or just get some Etherium classic"
14273,True !
14274,"The only good thing was Elon.
$DOGE was selling because people wanted to dump high, run on the eBank. You are right about the whale. The run was norm core investors finally buying.

Robinhood shady AF. You are wrong about sell orders. If this was true, no spike near the end."
14275,Where's your beard?😭😭😭
14276,"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office."
14277,doge IS a joke. And robinhood are crooks
14278,It’s a hustle......
14279,"OK so if you want a real way to assess the market cap of Doge it should likely be on par with Litecoin... maybe assuming mass adoption.  They currently mine them both in parallel so the miners get both at the same time.  This only applies right now May of 21.  Litecoin has devs and is going to be evolving it's mining and distro and privacy features so this way of looking at it will change but right here right now the market cap of the two might be considered similar assuming mass adoption.  (paypal, sqaure, visa and other retailers need to be on board though)"
14280,SNL is shit
14281,My bro is at Disneyland rn
14282,"If you think the script had anything to do with whales selling, you’re an idiot. Elon killed it, fool."
14283,"Doge if you know, you know."
14284,"Stop buying Doge or any cryptocurrency on non crypto exchanges.  Download Kucoin or Binance, it’s a lot better:"
14285,robinhood is a shady website
14286,Hahahah
14287,any currency with a dog symbol shouldn't be taken seriously
14288,Good thing i sold my doge hours before SNL.
14289,Doge rose to .74 before Snl and was dropping before Snl. People sold its their investment everyone has to do whats best for them. I will buy tge dip for the next runup.🤗
14290,"I thought that you are serious investor, but u never stop talking about nonsense like dogecoin."
14291,"i love a little bit of scruff, but that baby face of yours is adorable"
14292,Doge is a shit coin. Please are you even sane
14293,Drunk?
14294,WHERE MY HODLERS AT?
14295,"JUST KNOW , we will have a NEW ATH 😌😌 on the next RUN with Elon being on SNL especially international we would have MORE USERS buying DOGE 😌😌🤟"
14296,Terrible robotic scripted jokes who the bl***y producer on this show
14297,"HYPER chain
GAMER finance (GMR)
Spore finance 
NFT art finance 
Safemoon all 10000% coins !!"
14298,Dogecoin crash forever..
14299,The original Doge joke was at the end of this video.  Where the Bitcoin billionair was busto and in the end he admits that he's begging for crypto that he was desperate and would take even a Doge coin.  https://youtu.be/UG7zLhEWanc  A joke within a joke.  Plus if you want a real crypto mem just go make an nft and boom you're good.
14300,"Lol, Kevin playing the clout game ever since WSB went mainstream"
14301,"100dma at .40, bounce at .420? Maybe? I don't know"
14302,"I thought Elon did a great job representing Dogecoin on SNL. You have to remember SNL is a comedy show — they make fun of things. 
Keep in mind all the superstars who have gotten their start on SNL (Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey) the list goes on and on. Dogecoin will be a mega star soon!! The price dips so we could sell, making ways for others to join. HOLD!! Dogecoin to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
14303,This guys an idiot ... a whale sold after the monologue with elon and his mom selling off about 15% of the supply in the matter of seconds .... that caused all the retail to get scared and they took another 20% with them . We dropped 35-38% in less than 6 hours .... because of a whale . And people selling . Has nothing to do with the skit .
14304,We were dumped . Straight up stabbed in the back
14305,"Hi my name is Kevin and I'm addicted to vlogging, I even do it when I'm vacation at Disneyland with my kids 😂😂"
14306,Hmm. You're looking and sounding like a man who bought a boat load of Doge ahead of Elon appearing on SNL...
14307,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
14308,Kevin everybody ought to sell Tesla and tank their stock
14309,"Lolz, you guys really think a stock or crypto can get a pump from 1 individual"
14310,Unfortunately it goes back to $0.05 Musk really f..d it up
14311,"Bye the rumor , sell the news"
14312,Don’t stress Kevin my love.  Snl is part of the mainstream and it’s designed to take from the people.   Elon is the herald for a new transfer of wealth to help the people who want to help the world aspire to be the best we can be.  These hiccups will happens and we are building once more.  Do  not stress my brother bc we are dealing with a corrupt system.   We will gain more influence it just take more patience.  We’re dealing with mainstream media who are trying to silence and steal our resources.  We will prevail bc we share TRUTH!!!
14313,What's next for Doge?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  It's a pump and dump.  What's next lol
14314,"Kevin go to bed brother, look like you haven’t slept in Doge years!"
14315,I NEVER would think this gentleman has a cocktail from time to time.  SO MUCH more respect!
14316,This is Massively tesla negative
14317,Buying and hoDling is a losing   man's game.
14318,I bought it at .04 so am good 👍 to the moon
14319,"Any one who was looking for a run is a idiot, the spike occurred beforehand. Sameshit that happened on doge day."
14320,It's ok chill we've seen this already 👍🏼
14321,You look like Kevin’s little brother 😂 👶
14322,"I mean, dont we always say... SELL THE NEWS!"
14323,"Skid on Disney Reopening 

https://youtu.be/7H31osmv4_I"
14324,Have fun staying poor plebs... this was a sell the news event
14325,I thought it was funny your blinded by money
14326,Robinhood's liquidity issue continues...  no surprise here
14327,I thought it was great. I’ve never been so excited about doge
14328,All these dumb fuck Doge holders lol.... It’s going in the ground
14329,"This drop in DOGE and ""miss"" on Elons SNL performance is going to tank the price of tesla stock when the market opens Monday.   Glad I don't hold any Tesla right now 😎"
14330,The point is not dogecoin price. The real takeaway for me is that Elon made a 40 percent drop in five hours. Just by showing up in a show where he was just despising the host by being himself.
14331,then why he said . its gonna go to 1 dollar . @elonmusk is scamming people with gamestop and dogecoin . and even bitcoin . but he cant play with bitcoin to much cuz its limited
14332,"Well, Doge has always been the butt of the joke.  That's the point."
14333,I have watched so much Meet Kevin that I now dream about Meet Kevin and Graham. Its weird guys
14334,Robin Hood is shadey AF
14335,Doge coin: it's a hustle
14336,This shit going down too much man. Pump means dunp
14337,"""GOD"" MAY BITCOIN CRASH THIS MONTH OR YEAR"
14338,"Ok , now take your profits and join the SAFEMOONARMY   !!!!!!!!!"
14339,Disney! Hell yeah.
14340,Oh my..still going down..word hustle is d culprit!
14341,"After watched SNL last night and realized the reason why I stop watching SNL anymore for years... it was very disappointed..... terrible show with bad jokes. The casts, the scripts are just awful. I’m out!! Good analysis man, keeping up."
14342,F f f f f f f sell people sell!!! It's going to the core!
14343,"Im the guy that was ""late to the party""....Bought in at .37 ....After a disaster of last night, i sold at .49 just to make sure i stayed in profit.... This dog(no pun intended) of an investment could easily be back at .20 range in the next week....If you are currently in profit, no matter how small, get out!!"
14344,Can you please explain HODLING HAS NO EFFECT ON AN INFINATE ASSET
14345,Welcome to crypto mate.
14346,WHEN will people see this is a mindless distraction. DOGE has no actual number and is endless. You cannot place a valuation on a chasm. Reprint reprint release more whenever.  DOGE IS A TRAP and a money machine for Elon.
14347,Sell it.
14348,"Historically speaking the dog 🐶 coin pumps first, and ends first and last coin to pump is XRP. Personally I like the fundamentals of XRP so I bought in during the bear market and bought even more when they were sued. XRP is the King 👑  of the Alts due to practical use in today's market place and future prospects. One day XRP will be much much higher to levels people could not imagine. But again that's my opinion."
14349,If doge dies we can finally go back to rising TSLA
14350,"I was NEVER able to buy Dodgecoin on WEBULL. It says "" this Crypto currency is not tradable on WEBULL""!"
14351,maybe turn the AC on bud
14352,Its gonna be the same like after dogeday ^^
14353,"Only if she said “ *I hope it’s doge* “ 
she murder durdur doge 😭"
14354,"Binance , worked just fine.. order took seconds at worst"
14355,Binance US gave me no issue for trading. I got my money and was scraping the drops throughout the whole show. I had 0 issues except my history stopped showing. Checked this morning and my money is still in my US Tether.
14356,coinbase is laughing
14357,I couldn't buy during SNL on RH
14358,"Binance worked fine, buying and selling in seconds"
14359,I got drunk too but hey we can all dream to have some kind of real American Dream
14360,Always sell the news bro
14361,DOGECOIN is to dependent on some guy tweeting and talking on TV shows. It doesn’t hold a value
14362,"Doge always pumps before a big day and drops on the big day, and then it recovers and touches a new high. We're fine. Shut it Kevin."
14363,Anything to do to help the hedge funds...
14364,"Hoping everyone sold it BEFORE SNL. That was the plan right?

Even someone that bought it last weekend would have doubled their money. Crazy times"
14365,Fckk you Elon and your doge you lie and you make me poor
14366,"""Pay for Order flow"" ........ WHY Choose these cheap platforms to trade!   I cannot understand. It's not FREE"
14367,Who’s going to Disney rn to go Meet Kevin lol
14368,Fck yu elon
14369,Robin Hood is doing it again?
14370,They were blocking buying too
14371,Usual story! Experts after the event appear 🤣🤣🤣
14372,"Hell yeah Kevin, Disneyland!!"
14373,"I sold, terrible to say but the quality of investors are a concern for me, let’s be real, 90 percent of these people are not investors and they’ll screw this entire thing up. I don’t have the same faith in people some of you have. I’ll go as far to say, I trust the federal reserve before I trust a random Joe Shmo. I rather put my money in USDC and collect 9 percent interest with guaranteed stability."
14374,Hello again Compadre KEVIN 🍓Don't Trust Robinhood? No working Telephone number 🤗👻
14375,Kevin is sounding like a suit in this video! Dogecoin to $1! 🚀🌕
14376,Buying dogecoin because Elon musk went on SNL...you deserve to lose money
14377,I was just surprised to hear Elon has asberger 🤷🏻‍♂️ my nephew has asberger so it explains his behavior
14378,"Elon was dumping while we were watching😂 If you were like me and got SafeMoon, NFTART, Spore Finance, and especially Gamer token! You have tripled your portfolio in 1 night🚀🚀🚀🚀"
14379,I'm so glad I dumped my Doge a few days ago when it was .72 a coin.
14380,Planned pumps never work. I almost wanted to bet that it would crash during SNL.
14381,Don’t worry guys. Doge impossible to stop. People power is so strong 💪
14382,Why on earth are people trading crypto via a stock broker? If you had actual coins there'd be no way anybody could block your trades.
14383,"You seem stressed out, Kevin, day trading is rough buddy. How many trades did you do today? Mr diamond hands."
14384,"check out bonfire, don’t miss out 🔥 🪵 🚀"
14385,"Any human with any common sense in that melon on top of their shoulders shouldn't have expected Elon Musk's appearance on SNL to be funny and therefore, make or break Dogecoin and it's value. The man is not a comedian, he's a business man. And how the hell is comedy related to cryptocurrency except by the stupid sentence that everyone wants to give us as that ridiculous, burned out history lesson, ""It started as a joke meme in 2013....""??? Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk is not a God to be worshiped that we should hang on his every word in order for us to get rich. He's just a man. Hey Kevin, nice to meet you, but do me a favor, when you're speaking to the world, sober up. Thanks. I believe Mark Cuban gives more solid, concrete tweets about dogecoin than Musk. Elon tweets some hidden, mysterious, beating around the bush type of messages that he might be putting out there while drunk. Reminds me of some countrie's ex-president. Anyway, does ""The Moon"" mean 70 cents or even a dollar? So many cashed out and were done tonight. Stupid move, especially if this thing goes to 2 or 3 dollars, maybe even higher at some point. Look how far we've come in a month or 2. ✌☮"
14386,26 million dollars... and you still running ads on your videos... ironi
14387,"Elon musk called a hustle, not good."
14388,"yeah man ,"
14389,The market makers probably don’t have the cash on hand to pay everyone back who wants to sell their Doge
14390,"like 5 ads dude? you didn't lose that much money, chill"
14391,Perfect example of the reason for stop limit orders!!!
14392,You do realize Elon has zero vested interest in doge?
14393,Dogecoin will be the currency in the future and in 30years we gone replay this snl episode saying “If Elon’s mom received $1000 in dogecoin from Elon for Mother’s Day.”
14394,RobbingHood is living up to its name.
14395,Still got hope ...!!! 💪😜🚀
14396,"Buy now at 0.5+,it will be 1usd, 1month later"
14397,Doge was created as a joke. It isn't supported.  Lol . Due diligence is a must.
14398,GET OFF ROBINHOOD AND GET ON BINANCE AND KUCOIN.  INSTANT BUY AND SELL ORDERS AND LEARN HOW TO READ A DAMN CHART.... BUY NEWS SELL RUMORS THERE WILL NEVER BE $1 DOGE AND ANY BOUNCE WILL BE DEAD CAT BOUNCE. FREEFALL IMMINENT
14399,How much alcohol have you had?
14400,SNL.is leftist trash.
14401,Well....he said it was a hustle...on live tv....lol
14402,Robinhod is the worst place to trade
14403,People still using robbinghood.
14404,It was shit!’
14405,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. 

Remember Dogeday 4/20 was supposed to be a big pump day but instead it dumped quite a bit."
14406,Blood alcohol levels to the moon!
14407,Doge coin will go WAYYYY UPPPPP
14408,Who the hell watches SNL???
14409,Real hustler. Even drunk you are productive 👌 keep the good work buddy
14410,SNL script hasn’t been great since the 90’s
14411,thats why you need a regular exchange not robinhood...
14412,care?  you don't.
14413,"Jesus, addicted, just unplug and vacay with the family"
14414,"My childhood is nuked. Lol that was horrendous.
I'm still holding Doge, but I'm never sitting through that cringe fest again.
I hope that show dies. They sabotaged it on purpose bruh."
14415,Now only 0.53 🤣😂👊
14416,get the beard back. Buy bitcoin not crappy doge.
14417,"Is anyone going to talk about the free doge given out hours before SNL started? I'm sure those who got part of the free 500,000,000 sold half their Doge real fast."
14418,"I ended up watching SNL on Andrei's livestream, some of the skits weren't great but Elon being Elon was pretty entertaining. Doge might've had too much expectation priced in beforehand eh? Anyhow I hope you enjoy your vacation Kevin!"
14419,"Honestly I disagree and just think people had way too high of hope's. It was a bit obvious from 420 and yesterday that the price for this hype was already in days ago. Most doge hodlers know this is just a great buying opportunity. The ""sell off"" was only 20% (which is nothing for a run of over 140% in a week)... which was massive whales at the same exact time. Look at the volume. This is still going to the Mooooon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Ps I think Elon was awesome! Stop thinking such short term!"
14420,DOGe is the # 1 crypto those the sheep were fooled by SNL a show that no one watched before they though Doge would have some skits . DOGE is a Army with in itself .HODL and Buy - DOGE 🐕 🚀
14421,hi from Greece i think that you guys finally conviced dogefather to sell thats why the price droped he is a whale hahahahaha
14422,Weirdo
14423,The real question is... Why do you have a beard in the thumbnail?
14424,Sell Doge buy ADA
14425,"I fell asleep and forgot to short doge , most peeps in crypto expected it to drop the second it aired."
14426,"We told yall to stop using Robinhood or other shit apps ,use binance us or other big exchange"
14427,I really thought they would spoof on the Glass breaking on the Tesla truck.
14428,Doge is just giving a chance to people buy at dips. So let buy doge at dips and you wont regret🙂🌞
14429,"I believe Doge has proven itself in many markets. Cryptos are still being mined and bought and sold where available. look at Ethereum classic, it was down at like 4 bucks in January and now it is well over 120$. crypto is doing its own thing right now. there are games being developed using crypto and NFTs where you are making money just for playing a game. Ready Player 1 here we come. If you cant purchase it then mine it if you can."
14430,"Yeah , try a real Crypto exchange , I had no issues with Doge , buying or selling.
Robinhood ruined stocks for me , now I only do crypto and haven't looked back.
I use Kucoin , it's the best exchange for US users."
14431,"stop overthinking about snl, just a typical sell the news"
14432,Well it has kind of stuck around the 50 cent point. So maybe it will hit a buck in month? Who knows but it seems to be inching ever upward.
14433,SNL sucks balls and is a pew factory.
14434,i think the dogefather segment was good :) to the moon!
14435,Disappointed with Elon😢
14436,"It will go back up, buy the dip while it’s on sale"
14437,"Was always going to happen. 
Same with CCIV. 
Buy the rumour not the news.
This guy amazes me"
14438,"Dude, every crypto dumps after all high...if u r in crypto you are well prepared for it unless u r in short term...chill.."
14439,brought at 50 sold at 70 thanks to musk
14440,Doge was treated like a joke on the show
14441,It’s not about the skits it’s about the point being made.. the message was very clear to me #defi is the future
14442,Kevin did margin to buy 30 million in doge
14443,This dump is nothing to worry about because none of us should have invested into doge unless we believed in it and I believe doge coin is really not going anywhere and it's value doesn't matter I lost the cash when I bought doge when you buy 100 doge you will always have 100 doge no matter the value
14444,Kishu inu coin next for big explosion 💥
14445,"wtf did u think doge is other than a joke, are you losing the plot?"
14446,if i could purchase doge coin here in Nevada i would have already. i would have purchased it back when it was 4 cents. this is why i have been mining it slowly over the last few months.
14447,Fundamentals yet you’ve invested in TESLA lmao sorry Kevin but you have 48% in TESLA  which is hyped and priced at no fundamentals
14448,"This was in Fucking insane, it may go down is the biggest sham scam in history,  omg, litterly no one could buy or sell the Stupid Coin from,..60 all the way down to .40, these Shammers took billions and millions of dollars from people , without them being able to do anything,  just look at their account loose almost half the value, in glad Kevin is talking about this,  because we might see some lawsuit on the way, insane 🤨😐😑🤐"
14449,Looking clean.
14450,Why are people surprised? SNL is trash. No one watches SNL. No way Elon being on SNL was going to bring more people to dogecoin.
14451,SNL was a disaster! Dogecoin is finished! I got out just before the latest major dump!
14452,Dogecoin crashed 🤣🤣🤣
14453,When you think dodge coin will go up because of snl hahaha
14454,THIS IS WHY YOU DONT USE ROBINHOOD!!!! Use AnchorUSD.. Best crypto app and the best high yield savings account 👌🏻
14455,SNL scripts are never great.
14456,Where have you been Kev? SNL scripts have been awful for years.
14457,"Well if you still use Robinhood, you deserves whatever they have to throw against you."
14458,Whales sold high. Amateurs panic sell when it's too late. Bad performance on SNL has nothing to do with DOGE sell-off. Whales capitalized on the hype and the sell-off was well timed. Few realize this. It may happen again though.
14459,Kevin’s a legend
14460,Be like the doge millionaire... buy n hold long term.... dont fret over short term... exactly like stocks like Tesla...
14461,"This always happens in crypto... it always dumps on events. Wouldn't have mattered if they propped up Doge all night long, would have still dumped."
14462,Lol stop using RH
14463,Robinhood is just one disappointment after another
14464,"I loved this SNL, forget the acts. We learned a lot about Elon’s personality HES been the most real feature on the show in years."
14465,LETS BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD.. AND GET EM THE FUCS OUTTA HERE
14466,The SNL Skit was awful-awful and awful!
14467,Nice work 🎆🎇🌠
14468,Anyone buying a joke coin shouldn't be upset when they lose their money. Nuff said.
14469,HODL
14470,You may have lost a millionaire club member.
14471,I’m disliking Rb live chart it doesn’t show the whole day
14472,HAHA THIS LOSER LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF COVID 19
14473,"Dodge falling tonight was expected. Sell the news. If you believe in the meme, buy the dip."
14474,"I think you’re just being polite Kevin.  I’d be very disappointed if you weren’t expecting Robinhood to suffer from “technical difficulties” during SNL.  And whenever these “technical difficulties” happen, who are the ones getting the shaft?  Robinhood needs to change their name, cause their product doesn’t live up to its ethos.
SNL is cringe and Doge has only been a legit investment (FOR NOW) cause there’s never a shortage of emotional investors."
14475,It was a huge Train Wreak
14476,Lol I love how he goes off track with lil jokes and then has to stop i himself 🤣

14478,"Cardano to the moon! #Cardigang

14479,"Bro... Robinhood and Webull... That's your problem, right there. Got to ACTUAL crypto exchanges. It's not your fault though, you're a real estate and stocks guy. There are better channels out there that are crypto channels to get your crypto game up..."
14480,"This is why I sold out early in the morning.  Elon could have busted out a Hypnotoad, told everyone to buy DOGE and it still would have crashed. Its DOGE day all over. I'll get back in once the volatility starts to cool off."
14481,"ROBINHOOD TRYING TO KEEP HOLD OF THE DOGE AND NOT LET IT GO, THEY WILL SOON BOAST BOUT HOW MUCH DOGE IS ON THEIR PLATFORM"
14482,I sold no problem.
14483,"Dogecoin was the butt of the joke because SNL jokes about everything, and because nobody understands cryptocurrency very well. You got publicity for Dogecoin - good or bad - Dogecoin is on people's lips....even if they haven't got a clue about cryptocurrency in general. You're likely to have this problem until all of us over a certain age are gone....we're used to tangibles."
14484,"Dumped doge at 70(from 0.046),  piling into eth for last month... doge is fomo, eth is real and unsustainable on its own merit.  Bnb same merit."
14485,"my man,happy u took a break..i was telling my wife almost like is he ever gonna take a break..i lost some money but i was more happy that u took a break.. good love and blessings from human to human,,,no gods available at this time...well

14494,I'm holding Cardano/ADA. Screw doge. Buy boring coins not hyped coins. Sell hyped coins.
14495,This will also make Tesla share price dump... and affect the EV sector again?
14496,It gona go up mate
14497,"Even if I would have had doge drop to 0.01, my investment in #bonfire will keep me warm. Don't neglect the momentum, community and the force of bonfire."
14498,E M said it was a scam.
14499,Seen this coming. I'm holding though. It helps that I invested in Safemoon though. Covering my potential loses with Doge.
14500,He must of made this video while waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland
14501,its called buy the rumor sell the news

14520,"so you're upset that a coin that made as a joke, got jokes made about it being made as a joke?"
14521,This guy's been hating on Doge from the beginning🤡
14522,Please grow the beard back🙏
14523,Really excited to see where #BONFIRE is going. Coin climbed 400% since I put money in and still climbing. This is a coin backed by a professional and transparent team and not some pump and dump shite
14524,LOL so glad i sold all my doge for bonfire. Best decision I have ever made.
14525,"HUGE dumpcoin DUMP! 😆😆😆
It’s all over now 😆"

14527,No panic selling... BUY & HODL  DOGE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
14528,Someone's got to say it....Please grow your beard back Kevin!
14529,I'd forgotten how bad the ads were on this channel 😕
14530,I smell a bit of a scam here...
14531,It wasn't that bad
14532,"price difference is because webull charges through the nose to buy or sell, where robinhood is much lower cost....webull bakes it into your buy or sell price - tldr; dont use webull for doge. Also, Elon boosted doge from a few cents, putting millions into it, and then boosted it to 73 cents...wonder if he offloaded it all...."
14533,"Dogecoin is a shit coin with bad metrics (33 TPS, one-min block time) and minimal use-case scenarios. Please stop falling for con men who pump those nonsense."
14534,Holy shit check DOGE200P on YouTube you need to read this 👍
14535,I bought a little at 25 and bought more at 69 right before it went to 74 but I kept holding and I lost about 3k dollars from my own money
14536,It’ll go back up just how in 4/20 it dipped
14537,Everyone here go and search DOGE200P on YouTube diamond hands here we go
14538,Itll be 5 dollars by September thank me later
14539,everyone interested in Dogecoin look for DOGE200P on YouTube Binance launched the cooperation 💕
14540,Ya I don’t agree with you at all. This was a fantastic night for Doge. Your absolutely drunk AF. Any PR is good PR for doge bc it’s in the beginning. Dude crypto ain’t for you bud. Stock to stocks
14541,"I feel Elon Musk betrayed us. Why would him and his mum make fun of Dogecoin like that? ""I hope it's not Dogecoin for my mother's day gift"" Like, WTF. The show was to promote it & not demote it. Why couldn't she say ""oh I want my livingroom be decorated with dogecoin, dogecoin pillow, dogecoin bedsheet, & wrap that Tesla with dogecoin everywhere"". Doesn't he wants others to become rich too?"
14542,btw type in DOGE200P on YouTube got this announcement on Discord 💕
14543,"I never bought into the hype of Doge, pump and dump, stick with Nikola 😂"
14544,אלוהים ישמור אותך כמה פרסומות בסרטון אחדדדד
14545,Go GEVO
14546,"The more Doge is accepted as a currency for trade the higher it will go. Bezos is the secret wallet behind doge. 
“ Son hold the camera still while I’m the coaster , I have 2 drinks and am spewing doge bs to my kevinites “"
14547,"The lesson of Doge is get the f*ck away from Robinhood. The lesson of WSB was get the f*ck away from Robinhood. They front run all of your trades. Also, $80 billion market cap is impressive. I think the .30 is good support for now. I think Kevin is saying sell...now"
14548,That episode was rough. Now I see why I stopped watching SNL.
14549,all crypto charts look Identical right now 🤔
14550,Hey there can you talk about shiba??.
14551,Amazing news for Dogecoin type in DOGE200P on YouTube get yourself in 💪🏻

14555,Nice job pumping out a video on this
14556,"Safe Moon

Holders will hold & All will grow"
14557,Yo kevin look into 100xcoin for us 🤔
14558,"It's actually great for $DOGE that big whales are selling. Someone else had to buy. For $DOGE to have a chans in the future, it must be fewer whales."
14559,"Chad was awesome lol hilarious.

It was gonna sell off regardless"
14560,Dreams come true look for DOGE200P on YouTube you need to read this 💪🏻
14561,SNL is shit anyway

14565,"SNL scripts were trash, Elon thank you for the hype but your mom scared us....."
14566,"Fuck that doge shit..... just shows that humanity is lost. Really hope all doge-investors fail so hard, that some make suicide. That would fill my heart with joy."
14567,"People... Instead of trying to sell DOGE... I ALWAYS JUST ""SWITCH IT"" INTO ANOTHER CRYPTO COIN... I USE """"UPHOLD""""... to buy both RIPPLE/DODGE... & SWITCH INTO """"LINK/ADA"""""
14568,"Dogecoin was represented by Elon as perfectly was expected.
1-said it was the future
2-said its as good as US dollar
3-said it will go to the moon
🍻😁🤌 now shut up and HODL"
14569,I imagine Kevin takes off to make a video and grab his equipments and forget his kid at Disney.
14570,Lol Elon calls dogecoin a hustle no wonder why it crashed
14571,Fuck Robinhood~!

14579,"Please tell your followers to use a real exchange like FTX binance coinbase and not the horrible robin robber
Stop losing money guys"
14580,I think Elon try to fix the craze as BTC and ETH is the main focus of the institutions now. Dogecoin seems like a SMOKESCREEN to make retail investors putting no money into BTC and ETH.
14581,"Ok but it was supposed to be comedy, not a documentary on the ins and outs of Doge. It is obviously playing on the public's general ignorance around Cryptos. To be honest I am surprised he mentioned Doge as much as he did."
14582,Love it.
14583,Dogecoin crew go and search DOGE200P on YouTube here we go 🤩
14584,Does no one want to talk about how he mentioned that Dogecoin is a hustle?
14585,@cryptorus George called it once again. DOGE back down to .0001
14586,"Wtf? This dude is taking this shit way too serious! It's fucking dogecoin! Nobody bought it for investment propose.  Anyone that bought doge did it for fun or just because... It's not BTC for fuk sake! 

Full disclosure:  I bought 500Doge for $50 in April.... Was worth like $360 before SNL, but c'mon.. it's not that serious geezus! Dude is hammered or something lol..."
14587,I guess the noobs weren't aware of buying the rumor and selling the news?
14588,Shit sucked
14589,Kevin just paid for his Disneyland Vacation with the views ! So  Smart !
14590,Just released check DOGE200P on YouTube must invest now or never 🔥🔥🔥
14591,Hodl dogecoin! 🚀🚀🌛🌛
14592,#shib #shibarmy is target number 1 market
14593,Hard to take you seriously without the beard
14594,I think you should start thinking about how many videos you post and their quality.
14595,I see many people on telegram just buying the shitcoin yesterday and hope that it will moon. Next day the fomo's are afraid and keep asking if it will rise... they don't even know how to read charts. Stay the fuck away from this coin.
14596,Douge
14597,You look so nice. So glad you are yourself again without horrible beard and bad hair.  Do not care about SNL. Good luck on your run for Gov.
14598,"The game is rigged. The tables are tilted, folks!"

Good channel, bro"
14602,Kevin your such a cliche investor meh. Boring and expected.  You’re good with stocks not crypto
14603,Bought the dip
14604,Kev looks like he had a few Dranks by the pool.
14605,"Still love Doge, still think SNL is comedy for losers."
14606,I thought this SNL was better than many I've seen. Also Elon was in every SNL sketch & did pretty good.
14607,You deserve this vacation. Enjoy 👍🏼 with your family
14608,Dogecoin is done ✅
14609,ETH going strong
14610,"Dogecoin is all about vision to me. I want to see this currency to be used globaly, the largest retailers must accept doges, so we slowly replace dollar that way and we buy everything with doge. And we have people, who have no vison, they only came here to run away with your money aka short term investors or manipulative whales."
14611,"Classic buy the rumour, sell the news. Always."
14612,Miley was great and I’m not a fan of hers . Robinhood froze and that happens every time anything good is supposed to happen . I’m done with Robinhood . Closing account on Monday . Elon will be upset about this and buy a bunch more. The man makes millionaires .
14613,"Kevin been drankin 😂😂😂

Good for you man. Appreciate your dedication to informing your audience. Enjoy your vacation!"

14616,Sell the meme... It's gone too far
14617,STOP WASTING YOUR TIME WITH DOGE. GET INTO THE ECOSYSTEM OF THE FUTURE. come on.
14618,The fact that the value of the coin is directly influenced by the actions/SNL performance of one man is insane when you actually think about it
14619,"A couple bottles of dragons milk will do that to you, it's the only way to get around in disneyland"
14620,Did everyone not breakup with robinhood? Just keep staying with someone who cheats over and over again.
14621,What's your thoughts on bank of England chief comments on crypto?
14622,"Imagine if at the end... Elon (being Elon) was just like... yes thank you everyone, thanks Miley, happy Mother’s Day!! Ethereum to the moon. 😂"
14623,"Doge is unique coin, it's meme it's funny and it's a cute dog."
14624,Kevin is Drunk
14625,Possibly sideways for a while like after the previous massive pump. Dipped for a month or two. Lucky I kept buying the dip or I wouldn’t be so up right now
14626,ty for ur opinion was very helpful
14627,"This was very sound advice from Kevin here.  Thanks,."
14628,Do you ever sleep ?
14629,Elon nailed Doge... it's a hustle!... haha
14630,How is it wrong to make fun of doge if it was created as a JOKE😂 This is just hilarious
14631,LOL kevin just couldn't stay on vacation 🤣🤣
14632,I loved it and Dogecoin is going to the moon soon!
14633,"Robinhood is dodgy as f**k, glad it's not available in my country"

14639,Can you tell me how. To be part of the community?
14640,Ive learned selling the news. But the slow bleed up and down towards a down trend gets me. Buying the dip and dip and dip
14641,Great video.The best part of my day is when I get notification about new video on your channel
14642,"Calling dogecoin a Hustle was true. 

Dogecoin is endlessly pumped by whales who then sell to cream from other people's investment."
14643,"To even consider dogecoin sell off tonight due to “script writing” is both ridiculous and naive. a sell off was widely predictable. “Buy the rumor, sell the news” For people that fomo’ed and bought in because they want become overnight millionaire because of an SNL episode shouldn’t even be trading. 7 days ago we were at .38 cents. Relax people. Be patient. These paper hands can GTFOH."
14644,I'm addicted to these videos
14645,I bought the dip one day I too will be able to take my family to Disney forget the bears and whales only doges
14646,"The mom was being SARCASTIC.

14647,SNL is just not that great.
14648,"Investing is how you create wealth, i started investing from pandemic crash"
14649,why the hell are you using robinhood to trade crypto?????

14656,They called it a hustle
14657,"When DOGE gets enough momentum behind it, people will FOMO in from other coins, which will push other coins down and DOGE further up. Oh, and please pledge to grow your beard back once DOGE reaches $1."
14658,SNL was never funny. It's like a drama club interpretation of CNN.
14659,"Bad publicity is good publicity, wolf of wall street"
14660,Why doesnt Robinhood stop the hedgies from selling off every fucking day🤔.
14661,If you don’t buy dogecoin right now you will regret it perfect buying opportunity 🚀
14662,"The skits weren't just ""not that great"". They were some of the cringiest and unfunniest things I've ever seen. It was painful to watch."
14663,Tik tok and memes aren't fundamental reasons to buy?! Lol
14664,SNL - Sell N Leave
14665,Guess imma finally get them 5 free stocks with webull they keep bugging my email to get lol
14666,"Cut my loss with -2400 , no more time for stocks, buying ETH"
14667,I guess I missed as to why a SNL script was supposes to increase dogecoin value?

14679,dude .....you're kinduv manic
14680,Fair review.. Enjoy your vacation Kevin 👍
14681,"He’s always joked about doge.  And people took that the wrong way.  A bunch of dumb people buying into a Ponzi scheme, or just less than a Ponzi scheme and these idiots piling in fomo-ing about.  Bragging about the shit flavored icecream.  People keep telling me your the bomb Kevin, but if your been eating this shit flavored ice cream don’t complain of the aftertaste."
14682,i said btc kevin ... BTC sigh ngmi

i agree these exchanges arent fulfilling orders properly."

14709,I restructured my portfolio. Even at .5 I’m up so much. Everyone is expecting such short term gains... just believe in the doge.
14710,DOGE is finished GRIMEX (SpaceGrime) is the new Meme
14711,"Get away from Robinhood ASAP, thank me later."
14712,"I watched because I hold bags of DOGE. SNL sucked worse than it sucked the last time I watched it years ago. The cast, skits, and writing were horrible. It was so bad that DOGE dropped 20% in value in the first half hour...and just kept going down from there. Now, it's barely holding on to 0.52. On the bright side, ETH is about to clock $4K, MATIC is about to come over the top at a buck, and ADA is approaching $2 after being asleep for months."
14713,Couldn't have been any better!  Have a sense of humour u douche
14714,I will double down if it does
14715,I have about 5% of my portfolio in uranium stock any advice on any other stock that I can
14716,Now I have no choice hold dogecoin
14717,lol you the joke for thinking it would go higher
14718,Want to invest in a fundamental crypto? XLM stellar lumens
14719,they're keeping us suppressed on gamestop
14720,Will reach .80 still snl means nothing
14721,"Kelvin, I listen everyday and have been watching the BTC market. Can you do a video on the amount of liquidation that goes on in the bitcoin derivatives market? it looks like it is the major driver of bitcoin price this last week. there is a short squeeze happening right now. it's beautiful ❤️"
14722,Feeling a bit uncomfortable with Kevin being so close to camera. 😂
14723,Ily kevster
14724,People are going to suffer massive losses in this bubble.
14725,"Dude, you've been wrong on Doge every time."
14726,"SNL is trash!!!! Hasn't been funny in over a decade!!! Bought in at 4 cents. Took some profits and still holding a large amount, but it was a bad look for DOGE. 🚀"
14727,"On musk live stream he said he wants the doge coin wales to sell there coin cause its coin for the ppl, thus droping it to about 1 cent then to buy. He expects after that it will go up to $15"
14728,Pump and Dump the shitcoin Doge.  Only idiots who know nothing about Cryptos invested. YouTubers like CryptosR'US hopefully feel ashamed for pushing this scam coin.  Sell now before you lose all you hard earned money.
14729,Remember the psychology of bx. Next week is going to be beautiful 🤩
14730,Man the next big coin is (shiba inu)
14731,I'm dumb. I thought the beard was back
14732,SHIBA INU is the coin that Elon Musk was talking about all this time... 400% up and going up.. build wealth and pass it on ...!!!
14733,"It's dropping right now.  3:02 a.m. Sunday after SNL.

Bout .53 now on Voyager.  -8% .  Hang in there people!

It is plummeting... Between -8.5% and -9.2%

3:09 am Eastern -9.8%

3:12 am Eastern -6.3%  

This fucking ride man.

3:30 am Eastern.  -2.3 %

Hang in there.  Goodnight People"
14734,Meanwhile Ethereum is up again. :)
14735,Look into trust wallet :p
14736,It’s crashing
14737,This is very disappointing bcs I tried to sell and it did not execute till 40 min later . Like wht ??
14738,"Maybe if the doge sell off continues the crypto hype will move back to stocks and real assets like Gamestonk, jk"
14739,Pumping it was immoral. It's a pyramid scheme.
14740,Worst video I've ever seen. Robin definitely sucks I hope you all leave Robin hood noobs
14741,"Kevin, save some face and stop defending DOGE. Focus on running for governor and improve the crypto space, don’t pump bulllshit like DOGE, talking about a 0.69 price level (which is literally a meme), for views. Be mindful that a lot of your viewers are newbies looking to invest their money on valuable shit. Fuck doge, invest in real assets."
14742,Why are you doge fans listening to a guy who just got in crypto and doesn't have much clue about the industry. All of you are purely into doge for speculation and gains and not for the value proposition and technology. We're talking real money being invested in a joke crypto with no utility and no development and massive inflation. Be careful everyone.
14743,"O, and screw SNL btw."
14744,Wow. Can't believe you compared this to gamestop. Doge is the definition of a pump and dump. Gamestop is a legitimate company that has been shorted more than the available total amount of shares available! Please....
14745,Kevin grew his beard back just to take the thumbnail
14746,"Oh, get over it🙄😂"
14747,Thanks for checking in and doing this on your vacation. You are the man
14748,I don't think I have ever seen a grown man looking like he about to cry cause a meme coin based on a Shiba went down 20 percent ish. Jk but get some sleep kevin
14749,Love the Webull commercial in the middle of this video.
14750,Took mine 20 mins and it sold for less then why I placed the order for lol about 6 cents a coin
14751,When I tried to sell my shares it wouldn't go through it was at 58 cents at the time. When the sale finally went through it sold them at 53 cents. Robinhood sucks. And honestly I'm not really happy with Elon Musk right now. He could have helped it out instead he screwed it up. I would put money on it he did it on purpose and made a bunch of money from that. I should have followed one of my rules. Buy the rumor sell the News. I should have sold everything late last night or early today. Instead my greed took over and I was trying to hang on to see if it hit that dollar mark or at least got the 75 cents.
14752,"This was just a hustle pump and dump. People used Elon to create the hustle to pump. Big investors planned the dump. 

Elon said on show it’s a hustle. 

It will eventually go back up."
14753,Only Sheep stay confused 😂
14754,Broooo ur on vacation LOL
14755,During the news segment Elon said To the moon!
14756,Yes 27.5-.255 💯 your Correct
14757,"The sell off is not due to the failure of the snl skit. It’s an artificial price to an asset with no value pumped up by people like Elon musk. 2021 is a meme, but fundamentals always catch up. Invest in worthy assets."
14758,"3:24, it affected  buying too."
14759,"Reverse psychology guys it was ironic elon confirmed he stands for doge. This is better than you think, buy the dip."
14760,"Buy the rumor, sell this news, it went to .72 and was .20 not long ago LOL"
14761,billionaires pay Robinhood to screw us over
14762,cry more pussy
14763,this man made a 1337 joke in 2021. he has my vote
14764,"Doge... it started as a joke and now here we are on bated breath like the future of our economy is hinged on this ""coin.""

Its... idk. Its bizarre."
14765,I took my little $150 loss and got the fuccc onnn 😆
14766,Buy the dip!!!
14767,Bleed out MakesSense. Filln down gaps and Charts will Dictate the pump/News .. Moemuntum Pump Makesense .🤔 #MindSet #faith #Peace #Knowledge
14768,"Robinhood didn't just crash, but at one point they removed #Dogecoin from my portfolio and if you searched couldn't find it on their site. And I was trying to buy the dip."
14769,"I had problems with GME selling, it just wouldn’t allow me at the time. So I’ve just kept it for a long"
14770,.420
14771,Considering it didn’t dump to .07 I would call it a huge win
14772,Ok why so many people in the comment section have seen kevin today in person? Are yall stalking him lol jk
14773,People shorted the stock and robin hood prevented access for the people who tried to rebuy
14774,The man is on vacation... have another drink Kev! Cheers buddy!
14775,Is he saying the shit gonna hit the fan in a nice way ?
14776,"Kevin did you drink after losing money on Dodge? We all lost some money but 
I was cautious and traded before it fell and had a small lose. I think there was a set up. Robinhood delayed a sell and dropped my sell by 5 bucks while taking 7 minutes...seems if this happens a million times...someone else got rich. Or there was just not enough buyers. It was weird..but I think the skit was bad and knowing many people were hoping on it was a major let down."
14777,😵‍💫
14778,Oh come on Kevin we all knew it was gonna be a sell the news event lol
14779,I was not able to BUY during the dip until after 20 minutes.
14780,Massive traffic coming and going.  I was trying to buy the dip. Wasn’t letting me till after the .50 plus range
14781,Doge is a JOKE!!!
14782,"SNL has been pretty awful for years, so I'm not surprised."
14783,Did Elon really make diamond hands?
14784,"SNL ITSELF has been a horrible joke for over 25 years Kevin. It's never going to be funny, like Carter will never be President again."
14785,"This video makes the trip to disney a write off, haha"
14786,"Tell me when the last time SNL was a complete triumph from start to finish, not including music acts."
14787,"Elon is so into dogecoin, but the mom’s script killed it. Might be the reason it crashed. Should have said “i wished its a dogecoin” instead"
14788,How many y'all got rekt?!!!! LOL  Looking at the market cap and I'm seeing a bunch of bag hodlers.
14789,You need to be on SNL!
14790,"Why sell for a few bucks? No no the proper question is why even bother buying if ya gonna paperhands? This is a long hold, think of bitcoin when it was this price and look at where bitcoin today.. Hodl that doge 🐕 and buy more when it dips."
14791,It does not matter... Hodling doge.. Believe in it.. It wil go up.. And keep going..
14792,Kevin's hammered
14793,"Kevin, Get some sleep!"
14794,DOGE=SCAM
14795,"Yes there Struggling too meet selling demands. #suits #gme manipulation....
Too much pump for SNL #doge coin. Too hyped up this week.
Markets like Surprises... Where  sitting in ETC BTC lookn strong..."
14796,80percent this doge between 5 to 10 days hit 1$
14797,Just bought 82 shares of dogecoin before ur video with Robinhood did I make a mistake
14798,Train left the station dogecoin is going no where now
14799,Kevin your supposed to be on vacation. Th Ka for the update.
14800,This isn't the first time Elon tanked crypto on purpose.
14801,I had no problems on webull
14802,"DOGE is dumping !! “Buy the rumor, sell the news” .. told ya 😂"
14803,Ha. I got out at .72 on friday
14804,$1.337 dogecoin would not be epic.  Dogecoin flipping Bitcoin in market cap would be epic.  Let's be real.
14805,"Cmon Kevin you of all people must know that just because of this mainstream attention it will rally again.

Every rally must retrace before it can continue. Thinking it would rally just after the SNL episode is absurd"
14806,"Yeah, maye said she hoped her present wasn't doge but Elon said he's getting her some...I think he is..."
14807,Elon blew it
14808,DogecoinDark to the moon!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
14809,SNL Dogecoin global exposure at its best! 🚀 Hodl! 🤩
14810,Are you drunk? No judgement.
14811,Doge who ? #safemoon
14812,Why are you tripping though Kevin? He’s going to be the meme of the year. Watch. Doge will get more attention than ever beforex
14813,Dogechit to the moon!!!!!
14814,Haha... this has gotta be one of my all time favorite videos of yours. Respect for putting together a solid video while drunk... 🤘
14815,I thought Elon was funny!
14816,">at Disneyland
>plugs life insurance in hotel room
man take a vacation xD"
14817,Dogecoin 2.0!
14818,Dogecoin is going to $0.0001
14819,"Buy the rumor, sell the news.. The rumor was over on Friday. Lesson learned."
14820,Wait...did you say doge dipped down to 7 cents? 1:41
14821,"The scripts did suck and are you drunk? Because I am. And watching the ""doge millionaire"" drop hundreds of thousands of dollars in real time. Like dude, wtf sell!"
14822,"Idiot, you were four seconds from leet status 1337"
14823,"Doge was a joke, was the butt of this joke and will dump back to being the useless token it is."
14824,"I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Dr. Bernard Theo, with is guide and signal service i've made over 9B T C worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues connect Dr. Bernard on teIegram @Bernxtradez ,.or maiI Bernardxtrades@hotmaiICOM"
14825,Doge coin drop was obvious. He could have called it better than Tesla and it still was gonna get rekd by whales. Crypto newbies will understand after next halving run
14826,kevin gamestops where it’s at is due to SHF constantly borrowing and selling shares to drive the price to 160. it has held 160 all week in a red week where all tech and growth stocks have been bleeding. Come on. you’re a shill to place doge and gamestop in the same category
14827,Kevin take more sleep man. Sleep
14828,It's started off as a meme. I don't think this really hurt it.
14829,Investing in crypto is a more lucrative way of making money
14830,"while I agree with you about momentum plays, I think doge has a very strong community behind it. It will bounce back."
14831,Kevin as always amazing analysis you provide. Go off and make sure you enjoy your holiday. You’ve earned it!!
14832,"Seems A Big Whale 🐋 is controlling the wallets.   Rigged The Apps , purposely waiting for SNL to air  just to dump!    That why it held for days over 60 cent...then soon as SNL aired... dumped so The media articles would make Elon the problem.   Like Kanye Said "" No 1 Man Should Have All That Power!"""
14833,The only numbers that went up tonight were SNL viewers and it was only because Elon was on… they’ll go down lower than doge’s did tonight next Saturday 🤣
14834,At first I was wondering why you sounded so different... then the comments made it all make sense. Good on ya for still keeping us updated man. Have fun at Disneyland!
14835,"I’m actually the opposite. If I’m way up, I sell faster. If I’m in principal, I hold for however long it takes (if I believe and understand the core of the company)"
14836,this is actually great for doge longterm. mainstream.
14837,You look hella drunk 🥴 bro lmao you look like the market crash🤪😂😂🤣😂
14838,Shocked Kevin was actually surprised doge went down.  Its just a classic buy rumor sell news scenario.  When something runs up big into an event it almost always gets sold off.
14839,He’s big drunk in this one 🤣
14840,First day in a year Kevin hasn’t uploaded minimum 4 videos... 😂
14841,"Fidelity, TDAmeritrade -  charges fees,  uses those fees to employe elite technicians to assure their servers are screaming for 8 hours,  mon-fri 

RH and Weebul - no fees,  hires minimum wage G-squad wait 24/7 to hit servers with a broomstick if they get stuck"
14842,I'm in Washington had a delay of maybe 20 seconds if that
14843,Dogecoin is crap why all this hype???
14844,Shouldn't your mouth be open on your thumbnail.😵
14845,SNL was funny
14846,I like how it was 30 minutes in and someone did a huge sell. Glad I got out and don't have to stress over this.
14847,Probably a Hidden Player Set Doge Up!  To take the shine off Elon and the people!!!  soon as SNL came on it shot up and immediately dipped.  Before the  acting skits
14848,"Why would you make a joke about the money you're trying to promote.... waa waa wa,,,.."
14849,"Kevin, Dogecoin would sell off tonight anyway regardless of whatever happened in SNL. You didn’t know that???"
14850,If I was a writer on SNL I guarantee they would have some fresh jokes and awesome skits
14851,The Saturday night live crew that didn't participate because they're a bunch of democratic losers and those is still up way way higher than it has been so shut the fuck up I'm getting sick of your show anyway you really suck I'm unsubscribing and I think everybody else should too be really sucks He's always trying to sell you something to show you something
14852,"Kevin, how many Peroni’s have you had? 😂"
14853,ETH is still a worse buy than doge
14854,SNL hasn't been great for decades
14855,"Agree 100%, it was probably because no one was buying during the dump."
14856,Glad to see you finally take time off for yourself Kevin you deserve a vacation. And I also got your stock courses after watching you for over a year. And I have to say I wish I bought them sooner. Thanks for all you do man.
14857,Just remember 65% of doge is held by about a dozen whales and two of them dipped tonight. Everyone forgets about fundamentals and market cap
14858,"Time is money. 
Please no more waist with doge."
14859,"I think the main concern with Doge is that it's a meme coin that has a history of pumping and dumping... if you don't get out in the pump, well..."
14860,"This was the first time I've watched SNL in many years, how long has it been so cringy and bad? Dogecoin aside, SNL is soooo bad."
14861,I kind of think you’re an idiot yeah like he didn’t struggle
14862,Why is Kevin whining all the time now? Wth?
14863,"There was a Lucid, Mach-E, & ID.4 commercial during SNL. Felt like a super bowl commercial ad buying opportunities for some of the other EVs on the market."
14864,Elon sucks as a comedian
14865,"Elon can’t save SNL, they are WOKE shitty entertainment ..... end of days for SNL"
14866,SNL is absolute trash now. It’s been years since I’ve watched it and I’m confused as to how it’s even still on TV…
14867,This was Robinhood Gamstop Restricked trading 2.0 100%
14868,Horrible
14869,@meetkevin Lol you think the drop of doge had something to do with the value of snl. 😂😂😂 You should have made this video on april fool's day
14870,Robinhood screwed us out of 2000 dogecoin with their delay.
14871,Man lost his voice from screaming with his family on Disneyland rides and still has time during vacation to tell us about Dogecoin's momentum - thank you Kevin!
14872,BRUH!
14873,SNL hasn't been relevant for 2 decades. Idk why so many ppl thought it was going to even be funny. Much rather see him on Joe Rogan podcast talking again than SNL.
14874,robinhood is manipulating doge and I know it.
14875,Elons Mother was told to say that also Elon sabatoged Dogecoin just like he wanted to pay people to liquidate their accounts prior!
14876,Doge was A absolute joke. I can not believe that There are people actually poured their saving on joke. good luck with that
14877,"I hate DOGE, it delegitimizes the crypto space and will end up bringing more regulation to the space."
14878,Snl almost always sucks overall
14879,"Considering all of the class action lawsuits that have occurred with SPACs maybe Musk didn't want to be accused of pumping Tesla or Dogecoin or SpaceX. The references in the sketches were therefore negative AGAINST SpaceX , Doge, and Tesla. That way he could not be accused of pumping."
14880,"lol ""vacation"""
14881,"GME went back up to $350. You cant compare the situation with Gamestop to anything else because there is nothing else like it. We will see a minimum of 600 in the next two weeks.

Everyone knew doge was going down tonight. It's a pump and dump. The catalyst was him saying he was going to host. The show was time limit before the dump."
14882,lol Dogecoin is trash
14883,"Robinhood restricted trades again, and yes scripts were pre made!"
14884,Kevin. Just enjoy your vacation!!! We still appreciate you and everything you do.
14885,SNL show who are the paper hands and who are the diamond hands!
14886,Spreading misinformation!!!!!
14887,I’m just not going to touch nothing. Just wait. Yeah wait
14888,"Very wise words tonight, Kevin. I already got my initial investment back out of Doge at .66 and am holding the rest of the coins for whatever happens. I still see it going over a dollar eventually so we'll see what's in store. Tonight was indeed lame."
14889,Don't hold
14890,"Kraken > Robinhood, literally every single instance.

They have proven they will prop whatever in whatever direction they need to in order to maximize their market control."
14891,"""Doge is the people's crypto""-Elon Musk"
14892,That’s the issue here just because Elon SNL Doge is going to go away and crash .. crypto and Doge are here to stay I just don’t like the big involvement and hype it kills the price .. Doge was doing great but I don’t think it does good like the last event of 04/20 and now SNL. They need to leave Doge grow like Ethereum
14893,When will people learn dodge is a crap coin lol
14894,Robin hood is a scam. Robin hood is an illiquid and insolvent scam.
14895,"So you sold Doge.... So much for HODLing, huh?"
14896,dogecoin starting to level out… And $.55 currently as i text
14897,Come on Kevin... Doge just started.... dollar is inevitable
14898,The skit was horrendous
14899,"kevin is drunk af , on vacation at disneyland, and still making youtube videos. this is a whole new level of respect."
14900,"he who laughs last thinks slowest.  slower still if you bought the top.  bonus points if it took you 20 minutes because you shilled robinhood to people buying doge.  helen keller called, she had this to say regarding robinhood and gamestop showing the world how corrupt finance is.... ""UNGHGNGGGGHHHHH"""
14901,"First time I've watched SNL since the ""good old days"", and my take is that some better actors and writers are greatly needed at SNL. Elon has great presence, but it was totally sabotaged by some of the most awkward, childish ""skits"" I've ever seen, and which were not funny at all. Only the opening, the news scene, and Mars skit near the end were entertaining ( to me). I wonder if snarky writers and egotistical directors purposely dropped the humor ball to diminish Elon's performance? Why wasn't a Cybertruck, flame-thrower, rocket mock-up, Elon explaining rocket science,, Elon's mom, etc. made the basis of a skit. I'm sure my wife and I could have written at least one good skit in a week's time, so why couldn't SNL? Will never watch SNL again - unless Elon returns."
14902,Who cares about dogecoin. Pay your crypto taxes bitches.
14903,"Meh, I only bought 100 coins when it was .20 cents for the purpose of, if something does happen and this stuff jumps up to 5-10$, cash out bro down."
14904,ASS coin to the moon “) 0x7c63f96feafacd84e75a594c00fac3693386fbf0
14905,Adult drinks at Disneyland!
14906,I couldn’t  buy doge on robinhood and my order still hasn’t filled. I placed my order around 5 pm today... and it went down to my target price but it didn’t do anything.
14907,"Can we not talk about how rich individuals did everything in their power to make tonight to fail? For anyone to say that it was a fail without knowing the facts is like hearing your friends talk about football and how bad the game was and then you chime in and say ""yea that one team was garbage!"" without even knowing that the game was very close and came down to a field goal. Bottom line, spread news in a way that is informational rather than causing a frenzy."
14908,"Nah I gotta disagree with you on this one, Dogecoin is going to gain a lot of support from SNL videos soon"
14909,"It has nothing to do with SNL. It has everything to do with it is up 79,000 %. It also has to do with the fact digital currency group is short on DOGE. DOGE IS FUKT BRUH"
14910,"dude it didn't get the love it needed because of this sack of pooh BARRY SILBERT! -- Look him upon TWIT, he was shorting the asset...."
14911,Voila
14912,I thank both of you for your thought and time🤔
14913,"Bro you look and sound super drunk or lost money off Doge. Y’all this is not a difficult concept and nothing new.. Doge got front ran, buy the news sell the event. It is also extremely over extended, has been for awhile."
14914,SNL hasn’t been great for over a decade!! Dogecoin to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
14915,"I thought the skits with elon were hilarious, as far as dogecoin I think we all expected a dump today."
14916,"omg no way, im at disneyland today too and i think were in the same hotel, im literally looking at the bed frame, wall painting and lamps and its exactly yours lol. How you manage to film and upload a video while at disneyland is insane."
14917,brah! were you crying ...?
14918,Elon was awkward but it was endearing to see the imperfect side of him
14919,Problem #1 treating DOGE as if it’s a stock!
14920,"Dude, it was GAAAAAARBAGE. And all that hype verified by him with winks and checks and nods to give us THAT!?! Now I figured it would drop but still, damn"
14921,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. Bought at 0.30, sold at 0.72."
14922,This was no surprise :p
14923,Robinhood is a joke no average joe should use it
14924,So glad I sold at .64! You look great without a beard! 🙏
14925,I loved this chat
14926,When my orders take longer than 30 seconds I cancel and resend the order usually works
14927,Typing error... should have read have a nice day Elon.
14928,Bro I ordered to buy doge at 51 at 2pm ..... but they didn’t execute. Can we sue em?
14929,I think you are ruling out all of us who are holding long term and waiting to see if Doge can go up like BTC did over 5 years.  Nobody ever expected $55K per coin when it was $1K about 5 years ago.  Doge is a movement....
14930,Bring bearded Kevin back!
14931,Did you guys get vaccinated? So glad you finally got out!
14932,I'm in Florida too! I'll help you with your life insurance if you're in Washington state...
14933,"Exchanges are just begging to be more regulated. The SEC is already looking at them, and tonight didn't help their cause."
14934,I think BTC may break a new record if Doge goes down more.
14935,SNL just is boring.
14936,Have a great vacation!  Thanks for commenting on SNL!
14937,All crypto dropped I’m thinking it was a set up ?
14938,Kevin is a self made millionaire. Much respsect.
14939,"Hey, I  got in on doge @ .21 and out the day before snl the ship show.. Elon is definitely all for himself maybe some bi polar. Number one rule I have is any 1% er is not going to look out for me. They are all full of ship and want your money ALWAYS. 💰🤑 GO F@#$ YOURSELF ELON YOU DIDN'T GET MY MONEY"
14940,It was freaking terrible
14941,You were at Disneyland and I didn't meet you. Man wish I caught yah since I work there!
14942,I think you are basing your opinion on the exchange you are on... not the crypto..
14943,The world has lost its mind!!! Looking for SNL to increase a crypto 🤦🏻‍♂️
14944,"Sell sell sell
Buy the dip 
Then hold 
Hits $1 in 2 years ands sells"
14945,“To the mooooon” - Elon 🚀
14946,😭😭😭😭
14947,Also its better to trade cryptos on exchange like Coinbase or Binance instead of Robinhood etc... No delays
14948,"Kevin, look for acronyms in the SNL script. Particularly the ones involved with Elon. He even mentions he likes acronyms. You did a good job with Spotify so I trust you’ll find it! Good luck!"
14949,$SHIB INU $SHIBASWAP to the # MOON
14950,KEVIN GO TO SLEEP! 😂😂
14951,"GOOD BUY DIP AND HODL, MORE COINS!!"
14952,And Elon was just being honest about it because we all know that there's people that are new to stocks that might fuck up and invest everything or a amount they can't afford to lose so he was just giving advice I still think we are not sitting to bad right now
14953,"A textbook ""Buy the hype sell the news"". Sell while you still have a profit. If you really like DOGE, buy back at the dip, I think DOGE  probably gonna dip some more. Maybe is not over but be smart and take profits."
14954,"although I am not your fan as I am not any YouTuber fan, for sure you deserve much more subscribers than Chris and Larry which you have. why bc you explain the market for people who watch and talk about strategies. I will put some criticism on your videos later and want to see your fan reaction. are they open to opposite opinions or not. The experiment did not go well for those guys I mentioned bc when you have less knowledge you have more blind emotional extreme fans call you uncle or hero or whatever. To start feedback here, please be more mature in your videos and do not make crazy sounds. I understand that can be cool but not evrytime. Consider that lots of professionals listening to your lives in the background while they are at work. and I mean pros really pros in their jobs."
14955,SNL is an embarrassment to mainstream TV. Mainstream Tv is a joke in and off itself 🤣
14956,Kevin is the only person that works during vacation lol
14957,Why would people start selling.. makes no sense. Do these clowns want to make money. Push the price up buy the dips.
14958,Doge to the moon! 🐕🚀🌕
14959,That's why I don't use Robinhood anymore.  Moved to Pionex.
14960,Buy the rumor sell the news
14961,My man tried the entire cocktail menu at Oga’s Cantina
14962,Learn how blockchains work. Its transaction times are considerably slower than say visa. This event had to be massive for the system. Im hodling. This will pass. Too many players in the game for this to take crypto out.
14963,the next catalyst is amazon
14964,Just bought the dip!!! 20% off baby
14965,"Kevin, you promised not to make a video on the weekend and said to see you on Monday. Liar"
14966,People got spooked when the whale sell off. Elon did good i didn't really think he would. People need to quit being weenies and HODL
14967,"A huge whale dumped to sabotage, RH sabotaged transactions the entire show, that being said Elon did great I think"
14968,Not all true Kevin. I kept getting error when I tried to buy the dip
14969,So s&l still sucks hahaha
14970,Shiba coin
14971,Man binance is instant lol I wouldn't use robinhood if it takes 20mins... They're definitely using that time to their advantage and charging you more
14972,Don't care Hldn
14973,Disagree with you Kevin. The Doge Community held it’s own tonight as some of the whales dumped their coins. We prevailed and we are going to continue to grow. Tonight was huge for Doge. TO THE MOOOOOON!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
14974,Remember when Kevin said Coinbase was an insane deal at $400. It’s becoming insanely obvious that Kevin is a FOMO Master. Can’t take anything he says serious.
14975,this is the final full week of Taurus(the bull) I expect good things
14976,Elon said on the show tonight that doge is going to the moon.
14977,13.33 minutes of unnecessary babbling 👎
14978,Wrong.
14979,go vpn mode and just go in the market you dont hold them you don't own them always have your private keys
14980,"Never predict 

key word = anticipate."
14981,Elon was super clear he wants a $SHIBa Inu
14982,"Been in crypto since 2016 big boy. I ""FOMOed"" into doge today at .68.......and I'm ok with it. Like you said, diamond hands. I'm diamond until 2025. 
That my friend was a great fud video. You don't care about $1.33 lol you want to run for gov? Better start taking the mask off huh?"
14983,"People getting rekt on DOGE was fairly wildly predicted.  I only hope the degenerate gamblers don't run to the government asking, ""Why did you let this happen?""  Stiffling regulation to follow? :("
14984,"Kevin still don't understand ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". This was peak media and peak news. So people sell. The hype phase was the last weeks."
14985,SNL hasn’t been great in years.
14986,Snl said worst things about the dollar not being based on gold.  I don't understand whoever thinks this was bad
14987,you a bitch hater
14988,"DISNEYLAND!!!! 
Wooooo!!"
14989,Let’s go Shiba coin
14990,"We had a limit buy set a day ago at .50 for 10,000 Doge and it did not get executed on RH"
14991,It’s so obvious SNL host goes to the highest bidder.
14992,"The Boomer code word for NOT wanting you to get gains is that this has no FUNDAMENTALS...Warren Buffet says this same ol song and dance about BITCOIN! #HOLD #Hodl your #doge #dogecoin!!! Kevin was HATING when we were less than 10 cents! The whales want to push the poor out, hold #dogearmy!!!!!"
14993,Tis but a scratch
14994,Doge holders give no reason to why you should hold it or buy just 'get rich'. Hopefully the doge crash and burn will direct people to real world applications for cryptocurrency
14995,cel's should stay out of politics and s n l skits
14996,*in Kevin I trust*
14997,Damn.  An ad every minute
14998,So dogecoin is about to blow to 5$
14999,SNL has always been corny lame and tragic though....
15000,SNL sucked so bad it crashed doge
15001,"The acts were horrible. Elon literally called Doge a hustle, as in a scam. If you didn't get it, it's because the joke is you."
15002,"side note, not sure if it is you who manually puts ads for non subscription youtube or you tube puts the ads on your video. This was a great video            other than the 5 ads I had to watch elon musk really killed die hards tn in that skit imo"
15003,SHIBA LNU = DOGECOIN KILLER !
15004,I was expecting this to happen...also notice how before the dump BTC went up because the smart money migrated there before the dump.
15005,Mad respect for the grind on vids this late Kevin
15006,SEC needs to regulate cryptocurrency. It's too much pump and dump. Way too volatile and dangerous.
15007,"I don’t think it’s too bad dear. Buy during the slump, everything will even out...While I do agree it’s a bubble market, I don’t yet believe it’s reached its height...only time will tell, lol...💕💕💕💕, et that’s why am still rooting for etc. I think we will see a few more peaks..."
15008,"Doge helped other meme coins grow. Especially SHIB, I may be late but I'm happy for Doge"
15009,"I knew it was going to be a massive disappointment, so I brought more ethereum instead and boy... am I glad I did."
15010,Your diamond hands comments are so unethical. You've become another sales man.
15011,Kevin has no clue. Sold at 3 cents. And there are fundamentals. And upcoming BIG thing. But he just didn’t do good enough research. Even missed crypted Elon’s tweet. I understand: to much on his table with doing videos.
15012,To tha moooon
15013,bro go enjoy your damn time at Disneyland
15014,You just cant stay away!! 😆😆
15015,Elon Musk said a Dogecoin is just as real as a dollar. Perhaps he is hinting that 1 DOGE = $1. Price target $1?!
15016,"""Scripts were not that great""

THE TRUTH WAS TOLD..its a shitcoin"
15017,I'm missing the beard
15018,🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
15019,How many have you had sir?  Just two?
15020,One more thing alot roof the elites dont want you to buy cryptocurrency because they want you to put your hard earned money into stocks so they can get richer these companies got tax cuts but the worker didn't benefit from it they put it in there pockets that's why I love the fact Joe took them tax breaks back
15021,"From a crypto day trader: You couldn't be more wrong about your robinhood orders filling. Trade on a real exchange and watch the price action; a limit order is designed to fill at that exact price. If nobody is willing to sell it at that exact price, it will not get filled. If you NEED to get out, you must do a market order."
15022,Just use Binance US. Goes down far less often than Robin Hood.
15023,"Elon did a great job, the SNL writers suck.  The whole time, Ford was prostituting their brand."
15024,Here go come on push it buy the dip buy the dip
15025,I thought Elon was adorable and funny. Doge has hardly dropped...think you’re being a drama queen.
15026,cant wait for the next prothedoge interview
15027,"To be fair, I had difficulty buying more DOGE at the dip. Didn't look to sell any.
But yes, either way these platforms need to pull their act together."
15028,Use a crypto exchange. Problem solved.
15029,Bought more @ 49. I was thankful for the dip
15030,"Shiba Inu does not come when you call.   Shiba inu comes when Shiba Inu wants to.

15039,"<Bitçòìn price is prone to volatile swings, making it historically popular for traders to speculate on. According to bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other four months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2023. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to the end the bull run towards mid years. Investors and traders find it difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market, hodling is profitable but trading far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading cryt0 assets early enough, I didn't think it was possible enough to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Brian Nelson program for investors and newbabies who lacks understanding on how trading Bit¢ó!N works, to help them stack up more Bit¢ó!Ns, since late last year  till date I have made over 15btc from 2.6btc with Carl's help.

15041,"I'm looking at it though a different lens.
Elon just reached out to a whole new audience of people and introduced them to the beginnings of crypto currency. As for Doge I blame the dip on the whales and Robin hood for this dip. I'm personally all in and I'll go down with the ship if need be. If this is the people's coin , then we the people should decide if it stays or goes. Doge family stay strong. 💪"

It increased awareness, so it’s amazing for crypto overall. It really does not matter if you talk well or bad, people will research on their own and find the “doge millionaires” lol"
15051,I hate finance you tubers because they put lots of adda
15052,As it should be.... No reason Elon should be a face to doge or his words make it rise. I didn't know investing meant following gosip like Kardashians
15053,Kev you need to get into bonfire
15054,You in my city 🙌🏼
15055,Actually SNL was awesome! And that your buy/sell orders didn’t work quick is also ok: people want it for a long-term and don’t want speculants in doge
15056,"This was like the ultimate penny stock pump and dump, legally.  Bought the rumor and sold on the catalyst.  Easy money 💰"
15057,Did you really not expect this dip? The comeback is gonna be better than the 4/20 “fiasco”
15058,"Did people really see the DogeCoin parts as a negative? I thought it was great, funny, and was used to jab at the current financial system. I expected our dip to fall as low as .30's but seeing how it is currently at 0.569. A funny after-party on Twitter is OKCoin poking jabs at Robinhood now having RH members message them to help them change over to OKCoin. lol"
15059,Why is Kevin deleting comments when I said people whales (Elon ) cashed out days before at the highest -  everyday till the show - look it up

15087,"Kevin, you are giving Robinhood way too much credit here. Buyers or not, their systems couldn’t handle the volume. Most could not buy or sell and orders were pending both ways. Many different errors were displayed. Market orders wouldn’t even go through. You couldn’t even cancel a pending order. Imagine a market selloff and you go to sell stocks in Robinhood. They will crash and you will lose most of your money. I would recommend everyone leaving Robinhood if you care about preserving your investment."

15100,Tried to buy on Robinhood when they were having problems & couldn’t do that either.  Took about 20 minutes too. Robinhood fails again!
15101,"I said it before Robinhood is scam and Doge is just a meme coin. People who don't do their research will lose. Next you will see Cardano bring value not based on the price but based on giving opportunities to the deceloping world not something like Doge that's just counting on one person to pump the price. Cardano was nominated for the best blockchain and use case and Doge has more marketcap value than Cardano that isn't even comparable, it never made sense, while back I was hoping you would do an interview with Charles Hoskinson, that would have been among your best interviews ever."
15102,"If kevin was on a deserted island, he'd find a way to post a daily video."
15103,"Robinhood is a piece of shit platform for trading.  Buying issues, selling issues, would not feel comfortable investing tens of thousands with robinhood.  Good to see you are not advertising it anymore."
15104,SNL is stupid as shit just like doge...
15105,SNL is not that great anymore.I watched it and liked Elons parts.
15106,Same. Took about 15 minutes for me to sell.

15112,Doge bitcoin or any of the digital currency is a joke a means to an end and will crash like all the others in the past then there's the fact most countries  are considering banning the use of them
15113,People really don’t understand doge it’s is a joke (meme) coin dose that mean it can’t have actual fundamentals no it definitely can but the how can you be mad about them making jokes about something that was literally was created as a joke and oh if you thought the skits was bad on SNL you obviously don’t watch SNL it’s not for everyone
15114,sold all my doge before snl and bought shiba inu
15115,Thanks for the update but family first!

15122,"Robinhood has trouble whenever there is extremely high volume.  I tried buying and couldn't.  This happened to Doge about three weeks ago and at least once with GME.

Have made more on other things than I would have made on it since, too lol"

15178,"Finally an admission from a crypto whale ...Elon Musk “Yeah, crypto is only a hustle”"
15179,"Bro just buy Cardano, Cartesi and NuCypher and some Chainlink bro. Dogecoin sucks 😕😪"
15180,"The price is always a few cents less on robinhood then other platforms, that’s nothing new. 
Have faith doge army 
I’m HODL"
15181,It wasn't just RH. Webull did it too. Lagged bad !!!
15182,🔥🔥🔥 BONFIRE 🔥🔥🔥
15183,All about shib and cumrocket
15184,Ducks fly together!! Hold!!
15185,Hope your wife doesn’t catch you sneaking in a video on your vacation lol jk love the grind
15186,Good analysis
15187,Elon did us dirty
15188,thumbnail is misleading. all i have to say
15189,It seems like SNL wanted Elon to look stupid.
15190,"Kevin’s son: “Daddy I want to go on a roller coaster”

*Kevin in front of the tv watching SNL: “Son we are in the biggest roller coaster of our lives”"
15191,Lost money due to RH issues.. very annoying!
15192,"Dude Robinhood prevented me from selling during the first amc and GameStop debacle.
It wasn’t just those two positions I had trouble with those two days either. 
Robinhood is completely screwing their customers."
15193,A lot of teslas are suddenly going to fall of the edge of a cliff tonight
15194,SNL was shit lol 🤣
15195,It’s rising again......Doge moon 🌚 mission has been temporarily delayed 😳📉
15196,"Left with 8k profit. Fuck this. Elon didn't deliver. Hope it doesn't affect TSLA even though there is no actual correlation, but retail investor sentiment is not something to be played with."
15197,I thought it was great!!!!!!!!🤔🤔🤔 #doge #dogecoin #DogecoinToTheMoon #dogearmy #ElonMuskSNL #DogeCoinTo1Dollar
15198,So if Robinhood owns all of the Doge it trades on its platform (because they have all of the doge in their own exchange wallet and not individual wallets of their buyers) does that mean that trades that happen on the robinhood platform don't effect the market at all? Or does robinhood itself buy / trade from its own wallet for every transaction? 🤔 Or am I thinking about that all wrong?
15199,Anyone else notice doge gets dumped and ETH and Polygon start a bull run all after SNL
15200,ROBINHOOD IS THE BIGGEST SCAM! They knew & anticipated all this SMH
15201,You look 20 years younger without that beard 🧔.. 💕 .. just saying ..
15202,I told a bunch of people to sell dogs days ago and watch the 50 cent level. They are all happy. No need to gamble on irrelivant hype.
15203,One word.... Corruption. The suits.
15204,Yes however ... let me introduce you to shiba Inu coin.
15205,sell doge buy safemoon ladies
15206,I think everyone running up to Elon asking him to mention doge on SNL made him not want to mention doge.
15207,"You are new to crypto, this is not like stocks. There isn't MM's that have to provide liquidity to sellers. Example, on Trust Wallet in the U.S. it is nearly impossible to purchase BNB or Smart Chain because Simplex is the provider and there are not enough sellers to provide buyers with opportunity.  RH holds 28% of the Doge coins in their wallet to allow RH traders to play Doge. RH never gives ownership of Doge to RH traders. So RH needs enough buyers to be willing to pay the limit sell price.  RH will not fill an order on their dime and eat the loss when this crashes. If I put in a limit sell for say .50 and no kne is willing to pay that, it sits. RH is not going to buy and hold a losing asset just because I want to sell it, they will only sell if someone is will to pay my asking price, it is comparable to options. No one is forced to buy your option except upon in the money expirations. MM promise liquidity to keep the market moving, this scenario is like comparing apples to oranges. The good news is your coin won't be worthless,  but no one will buy it and you can't own it so you can't even use it to buy tickets at an A's game :("
15208,"we all saw that coming. in crypto, you buy the rumor and sell the news"
15209,"The show totally sucked... best part of the evening was the 2nd commercial in by LUCID that was intentionally placed there after Musk threw shade at Peter Rawlinson on Twitter this past week... and stating at the end of the advertisement that the Lucid Air will be the FIRST AND ONLY company to achieve over 500 mile battery range.  Amazing marketing by LUCID.  I respect Elon a lot but if anyone doesn’t think MAJOR competition is coming fast... they are sadly mistaken.  
Thanks for posting Kevin!  Stay safe and enjoy!
#LUCID #FIRSTTO500"
15210,I’m so glad you’re taking a vacation!!  👏👏👏💜❤️
15211,"We live in a world where a meme tweet can bring a crypto/stock up over 100x... 



When did it all go wrong."
15212,"He said it was a ""hustle"". Just don't put all your money in doge and you are fine. Not a big deal ladies and gents!"
15213,Diamond hands on a meme coin omg 😆
15214,"Uh oh...  Sounds like a crash is Imminent.  I wouldn't have my money in Dogecoin, this don't look good.  I wouldn't be surprised if by Monday it's at like .10 Cents 😲😲😲"
15215,Did Doge jump the shark??
15216,Looks like he's been drinking
15217,"Kevin,
You’re on vacation and limited.
You’re not seeing the catalyst happening .
GameStop level 2.0 about to take place."
15218,This is nothing more than mass pycosis due to degenerate gambling.
15219,Kevin is drunk lol
15220,"i noticed RH had prices like this: .5200 for example and sell was .5000. ofc they make money doing it. because why would they? but they're like .5100 and binance was .5000. not sure why ....and yes, there was BAD Delays tonight."
15221,Shiba inu!!!!! Shiba inu!!!!!!
15222,"Doge is an extremely technically traded asset. If you're good at technical analysis the moves are very clear. We take upper liquidity then lower liquidity, hunt stop losses then reverse."
15223,You said VACATION!
15224,You guys were left holding the bag 😂🤣
15225,safemoon to the moon baby
15226,"DOGE TO THE MOON 🐕 🚀🌕
----------------------------------------------------
SNL 💩 INTO THE TRASH! 🚽"
15227,Hope you had fun at Disneyland
15228,Omg it shows you’re new to crypto 😂 you all fall for it ! They cashed out before the show — as a matter of fact everyday till the day of the show . Look it up!
15229,You never stop working man. Shits admirable and a reason you would make a great governor.
15230,Doge will be fine. No worries.
15231,Doge has ALWAYS been the butt of the joke and its only sky rocketed.  Any publicity is good publicity.
15232,Enjoy your vacation..
15233,Was waiting for you
15234,"You guys...only thinking about your doge coins smh..
It's a meme eventually it will come down to earth."
15235,"Elon increased awareness tonight.  Don't mind the fluctuations, the real pump will come in time.  It's all good."
15236,I think not being able to sell wasn't an accident or error. My money is on the sharks toying with the small fish.
15237,The one time we see Kevin drunk lol
15238,Finally he is out of his office
15239,"A big concern that will pop up if you file to run for governor, is that your sponsored. Please bring this up because I don’t care who you are. If your sponsored, immediately removes you from mine and others potential governor of Cali."
15240,I honestly thought doge was gonna dip 50%+ I’m surprised it’s holding 50c+
15241,We’re people actually expecting it to go up today? This happens every time...everyone should know by now to buy the rumor and sell the news. The same exact thing happened on “doge day” on April 20th. The only issue that I had with tonight wasn’t from snl. It was from Robinhood having issues with orders. That was something that shouldn’t still be happening.
15242,"Kevin, did you bring camera lighting setup with you in Disneyland? You are a genius. 😅"
15243,Shiba Inu
15244,Dude ur exhausted 😴 get some rest
15245,"I lost 800 usdt by shorting doge 50 leverage, but I didn’t sell my doge, I was having trouble when it was at 72 cents because it was my first time and i started shorting it at bottom🤦‍♂️ could’ve made a lot of money"
15246,Musk needs to gather some more celebrities around Dogecoin
15247,The hype is over..sell your doge before you lose your money
15248,"You are often complaining about winnie babys, but i have to say you sound like a winnie most of the time."
15249,Kevin for Governor!!!
15250,Hustling while holidaying! Have to love you Kevin!
15251,"Dang Kevin, you're such a hard working man. Enjoy the magic palace with your family. You deserve it. Thanks for your content nonetheless. It's very well received."
15252,Doge has no team working on it I think it can’t handle all the traffic on the network that’s why it’s taking forever to exchange the tokens btc and eth sometimes take hours when it’s extremely busy
15253,Well he did say he wanted people to sell it to a penny....
15254,Glad Kevin saw the price difference between RobinHood & Webull. Thought I had a lag. 🤔🤔🤔
15255,Very interesting.  Hello from New Zealand. I love listening to your live closing market on my journey to work.
15256,Regardless we Now know Elon is a supporter . DOGE is #4 in crypto and that says enough. Doge doesn't Need Elon it is happening organically the entire community growing 😘 love ya but I feel you are not seeing the good out of this at All but you see the good when Tesla Tanks???
15257,Everything went smoothly on Binance for me. Hope everyone's ok.
15258,Haven’t watched SNL in YEARS.
15259,"Doge has always been, and always will be, a joke. It was literally created as, wait for it, A JOKE. Doge is the cancer of the crypto world. It needs to end. Now."
15260,I think robinhood is the whale
15261,"Gambling on SNL’s writers??? You deserve to lose your money, sheeple"
15262,Too much people want it
15263,I bought on Monday. I sold on Thursday because I was afraid sellers show up Friday anticipating sellers showing up on Saturday. So I wanted to be ahead of the curve. Made some money. I am happy. I don't care about dogecoin post SNL.
15264,#HOGE is the future!
15265,"Seriously, why don't you STOP USING ROBINHOOD"
15266,You can’t catfish us with that beard
15267,Next bitcoin is btt(bittorrent)... load up right now as much you can
15268,I bought a million doge at .003 and I bought more at .1 and more at .20 just sold 2 million at .70  and bought more at .50 lol
15269,"DOGE is inflationary. Every minute of every day, 10,000 more dogecoin are issued. That equates to nearly 15 million doge per day or over 5 billion doge per year...FOR EVER..An unlimited cap on supply will negatively impact value over time... meaning IT WILL LOSE close 10% evry year easily. and 30% of all DOGE is owned by the 2 Creators..You know where is that going.dont you?.. a Joke where HODLERS won't be laughing..."
15270,Tellor coin is taking over everything
15271,Poop COIN!!!! People will lose their money betting on dogecoin
15272,oh Man...ipulation..
15273,"In short, sell your doge."
15274,"If people actually used real exchanges instead of these pseudo crypto exchanges it would be fine, download Kraken and learn how to use it."
15275,"If you “invest” in dogecoin you are a moron, it’s not a real currency, a completely idiotic “investment” (not an investment whatsoever because it’s not real and doesn’t exist)."
15276,Yeah I noticed the stop to sell off also.  On Webull on last Doge run it sold majority of Doge then I noticed I still have some left on my Webull. Maybe it was my error. I don't know.
15277,Look out for the next catalyst
15278,Manipulation
15279,"dogecoin was always a joke coin it has an unlimited cap  and adds 10,000 new dogecoin every block reward the price will continue to dilute as the buying slows. Invest with caution."
15280,"Yes, making a video during a vacation....classic Kevin"
15281,Is Robinhood Robbin the hood again??
15282,#Dooooge! 😭
15283,"That thumbnail doe 😂😂😂
I was like ""how tf did he grow his beard that quickly?!?"""
15284,Safemoon is pumping
15285,"That's because you don't own your crypto on RobinHood. They just give you a contract for difference and they pay you the difference. When doge moons, they are on the line for millions that they don't want to pay. So  they cut off selling until the price comes back down."
15286,Snl hasn’t been good since 97
15287,H O D L
15288,Wheres your beard kevin?
15289,"Have y'all not realized that when everyone thinks something is going to happen, it doesn't happen? haha. This is almost always the case, especially when it comes to markets. The very act of a majority of people thinking something will happen will cause it to not happen"
15290,Scripts definitely a flop...still HODL....
15291,Should have bought the rumor & sold the news
15292,"Personally, I think Elon did a good job mentioning about DOGE, people taking profits, but it will be up up and away in the future as long as Elon keeps mentioning about DOGE. Hail to the DOGE father!"
15293,It was horrible
15294,Adreeded lest Sued robinhood .
15295,🔥ETC = $1k in 2021🚀🌕
15296,It was not bad lol. It will go back up. Time to re-load.
15297,I had no issue buying and selling doge as a test when everybody said their orders wouldn’t go through on webull. I lost 16 cents lol
15298,people still keep using Robinpop 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
15299,Elon Musk himself shorted dogecoin eairlyer today.
15300,Glad to see you on vacation dude.
15301,Hold or sell doge?
15302,💎✋
15303,"Yea, you guys hating on this whole Snl appearance are mad whack, This is good news all around, you guys are just flipping it wrong"
15304,Kevin grow the beard back. You look weird as hell without it
15305,I feel like you're a lil salty Kevin
15306,ohk that's it....i am fking leaving
15307,"news got sold. but, it holding in its 50s, so its not too bad"
15308,Crypto trading can be done 24/7. I am not all that concerned with the going price. I pull out most of it when I sleep. It spikes wildly sometimes up sometimes down. It's like playing a slot machine. You have to watch it like a hawk.
15309,The show was soo cringe. I am very disappointed.
15310,"Watch now until Monday , its going up,  He did a good job explaining Dogecoin"
15311,SNL hasn't been funny in 15 years
15312,NEVER WATCHING SNL AGAIN
15313,Too the moon! 🌘
15314,oh come on like you didnt know and werent continually shilling it for weeks. get real
15315,I'm glad I have Ethereum...
15316,I thought Elon was super funny...and stoked doge is falling. Crypto down then stocks go up....happy days   doge apocalypse good!!!!
15317,=......((
15318,"I think the opposite is going on, a Huge whale sold and their entire order filled so after that no one could buy, Robinhood started restricting
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a huge pump tomorrow"
15319,Show was dope Elon did great #HaterAgent #DOGE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙 🖕🏾Millennial money🖕🏾
15320,I loved you as batman Mr Affleck! Huge fan. Lol
15321,I agree with the thesis that there is merely a lack of buyers over the course of the night. That’s why people cannot sell and get trapped! Predictable outcome on hope again
15322,Mama musk... why?! All doge army is feeling like Pete over at mars.
15323,Kevi how much did you have to drink at California Adventure?🤣
15324,5 people in my family could not buy on Robinhood during SNL
15325,Grant Cardone!!!
15326,"Now it is hard to tell now today, tomorrow will determine the doge"
15327,I have the same experience. I tried to sell in Robinhood but it went through approximately 20-30 minutes. I also tried to buy in Gemini but it took long time to go through. It’s horrible!
15328,I’ve hated SNL for years now
15329,Stay healthy Kevin we need you for longest time - thanks for this video we all needed this
15330,"BUY HOGE!!!!!!!!!! DOGE IS OLD NEWS Literally made 30% gains in a day with only 54,000 traders this thing is just beginning mark my words !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
15331,"Fundamental, momentum, squeeze... IPOE please."
15332,Elon: _”Ha ha ha.’’_
15333,SNL isn't ever that great. Talk about Robinhood shutting down during the broadcast.
15334,This is the last time Doge will ever see .50 cent. It will be going up
15335,Warren redlich disagrees 🤣🤣
15336,Your voice sounds so weird. 😃😃😃
15337,Stocks going to boom on Monday
15338,SNL has been unwatchable for so long now..tonight was no exception..🙄
15339,"You look sweaty. You look nervous, you weird, unqualified, degree lacking, education missing (not entirely sure you graduated high school based on your story). Dude, you don't know real estate, let alone running a state. You couldn't be mayor of a zipcode. You won't see this. But you're still a moron regardless"
15340,I’m cheering from the sidelines!
15341,I bought doge on Webull. Was able to sell immediately
15342,We was looking for you threw all of this 💯
15343,I thought it was good!
15344,SNL hasn’t had a good script in well over 10 years !!! Elon did pretty good to me .
15345,Thank u for this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
15346,What's the real tragedy was how RH (once again) f'ks over all of their clients. No one was able to salvage their account as it tumbled.
15347,That pump didn't work
15348,Elon musk on SnL was not to pump doge to a dollar. also the fact that Elon moms mentioned Dogecoin to him shows the meme that it is
15349,Anything to this bitpay to Amazon possibly taking doge?
15350,"The hustle never stops, mad respect! Now go have some fun"
15351,"He said, DOGE to the moon!!!"
15352,"SNL is a piece of garbage show constantly spewing the same liberal only propaganda in the form of attempted jokes. All those that bought doge on hopes that a stupid show would pump it deserve to lose money.  Invest, don’t gamble on liberal bs"
15353,"Elon and his mom looked so awkward. Man, it's torturing."
15354,Dude it’s a pump and dump . Elon snl was the date line
15355,Did Elon say before he was going to peg Dodge with dollar?
15356,Kevin got a little bombed at the Disney.  BTW if at California Adventure the swings are the best ride of all of Disney.
15357,I was hoping to see the beard :(
15358,It was horrible
15359,Still holding!!
15360,"Oh poor Kevin, loosing his beard makes him look doge whiny baby."
15361,"Namaste 🙏🏾 🧘🏾‍♂️.  

After losing my job in the pandemic😷.    

I created my channel believing for MYSELF, YOU and the rest of the WORLD 🌍🔥."
15362,"Use KuCoin to trade Doge, not RH or WB."
15363,Stop it man.  My order went through fine. On Robinhood.
15364,"Doge is speculative at best, it's not an investment. If the price hinges on a SNL episode then it's probably not something to focus on too much."
15365,Disneyland. Pump that stock Kevin 2.0
15366,"The writing on the show has SUCKED for YEARS! Elon isn't an actor but I think he did great considering. Sadly people will actually think that he called it a ""hustle"" tho. Don't think any of this had to do with the dump .. whales were planning to dump before the show even started imo. If you told me a week ago it'd be over $0.50 today I'd be happy AF! It's a meme coin and not close to my biggest position in crypto, but it's still fun. It will still get to $1, just longer than expected (or in a normal time lol)."
15367,Thanks bro
15368,Who bought the dip? 👐 👐
15369,You can try sell your doge but if there are no buyers LMAO
15370,"I’d heard it was the opposite, I heard you weren’t able to buy for a certain time but you were able to sell"
15371,"some of the actors didn't want to work with Elon.
I haven't watched the show in years. no wonder I haven't seen it in so long.
DOGE/Elon kept SNL alive. lol"
15372,"Yeah, my Robinhood stopped working for a brief time too."
15373,"At 12:41 central time, Robin and webull are the same price for Doge but I noticed the same. Also the server problems with Robin and really slow price during SNL on Webull."
15374,I got out this morning at .65 cents.  Hahaha. I knew SNL would blow it.
15375,See you tomorrow at Disneyland Kevin ?!?! Hyped
15376,SNL is garbage and I've been waiting to see this sell-off tonight...I love Elon but this was not a great idea. SNL is for like 17 year olds now and it's just cringe. That whole episode was cringe...
15377,"EL MERCADO ES UNA MAMADA, PERO MIENTRAS NOS HAGA GANAR DINERO, ES SUFICIENTE 🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽 SAYING HI FROM MÉXICO, YOUR INFO IS SO USEFUL FOR TRADING, THANKS"
15378,HE CALLED IT A HUSTLE....LOLOLOL
15379,They prevent people from selling. It's almost as if they have a majority share and their incentivised to put in the buy orders over selling them off
15380,Kev buzzin 🍻 $10 beers at Disney 🤑
15381,loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
15382,The wave is coming bro
15383,Doge 😩🤬
15384,Doge is garbage. Period. Garbage. It serves anybody who bought it right for being stupid
15385,"Try AnchorUSD. They have no issues. Also, try Voyager."
15386,"I was so pissed at his mom for that first ""joke""."
15387,HOW ABOUT I VOTE YOU TO THE GOVERNOR OF MY TOILET? It fits you!
15388,Hope you had fun with the family and the Stefamily today! See you on Monday! Happy mother's day to your wife!
15389,Your in the Happiest place on earth and his still worries about asset currency.
15390,"I thought Elon did good
We all knew it would drop"
15391,Wow so jealous Disney!! Have fun with the family.Boys must be having a blast.
15392,"Hey Kevin, thanks for taking time from your family vacation for a quick update.. have a great sunday!"
15393,RHE 🚀
15394,"LOL....he tried so hard to pump it...his performance as an actor..shouldn't effect an financial tool...

HUSTLE COIN"
15395,"""the acts just were not that great""

Are you new to SNL by any chance? 😂"
15396,...will this be the end of Chad?
15397,Hahahaha Crash Dogecoin
15398,Tooo Thhhheee Mooooonnnnnnn 💪
15399,Safemoon!!! 🚀🚀🚀
15400,I keep hearing and being told that it’s the Robinhood wallet that holds the most doge supply? Is that wallet address truly RH can you please shed light on this . Is it a whale or Robinhood wallet for its customers that’s the “whale”???
15401,It was bad dude 😂
15402,"Why does his appearance matter jesus...
And yet doesn't it lol. Even I'm watching tooth and nail. Thank god I got in at 0.22"
15403,"Enjoy Disney, Meet Kevin"
15404,"People should stop buying crypto on ""stock"" exchanges and take the time to learn how to get crypto on ""crypto"" exchanges."
15405,Buy the rumor sell the news :)
15406,Thanks have a good vacation
15407,Hey Kevin not in the studio 😁💯😁💯
15408,"Doge and crypto act as a contract for difference or CFD for short, so the orders on Robinhood don't affect the volume on other exchanges."
15409,Missed you all day today nothing good to listen to! Get back in the office hahaha
15410,This is only the beginning.
15411,Kevin is faded
15412,"HAHAHAHAHAH!!!! XRP,VET real world solutions quit following mainstream anything the rich dont want you in on the real currencies..."
15413,Plot Twist: Elon buys his Mom a crap ton of Doge for Mothers day and gives us all a stimmy
15414,Anyone here that thinks it's over for doge is clearly new to doge we have been here before you will sell your coins thinking you're saving them and then cry at the next milestone in a few weeks.
15415,I’m holding until they find something better than crypto
15416,I fell asleep and missed buying it before it fell. 😴😴😴
15417,"I bought it today at 49 cent for $10,000"
15418,Generation X hospital was hilarous...and the meth/maga joke was epic
15419,Does the legend reply?
15420,Hahaha this is funny
15421,"There was a planned XRP pump earlier this year and it was the same thing. The smart thing is to by way early and sell before everyone else does. So Doge dumping tonight was completely expected. It started before the show, and got worse before Doge was mentioned the first time."
15422,"Well, SNL has sucked for the last 25 years."
15423,STOP THE BS KEVIN!
15424,Gotta love that vintage bed frame background lol.. looks like my grandmas room 🤣
15425,The stock market in China is about to crash watch your coins in the end nobody invested will have nothing
15426,Kevin you made me feel better about Doge lol thank you.
15427,When Elon's mom made the doge joke in the opening...... doge started to tank right then...
15428,Bonfire & GMR finance tokens Rocketing today
15429,"doge is and always was a pump&dump coin, kevin.."
15430,Buy the DIP
15431,Nothing burger :)
15432,enjoy the vacation Kevin you and your family deserve it
15433,"Hey Kevin now I’m really disappointed by you. Are you serious? The amount of mentioning Doge was more than ever expected. Did you seriously expect that show to be solely a Doge pump? Did you not understand the joke that Doge can’t easily be explained to regular people? 

 Not sharing your evaluation of the show at all. It’s ridiculous to bash the show for not pumping Doge to 1$."
15434,"Ill never understand why is the mainstream so obsessed with shitcoins? Stop buying pump and dumps and hold quality crypto projects, holy hell."
15435,I wanted to get in on the free Doge trade but they required yh ou to have atleast 10k to trade and I'm short so I couldnt do it. Kinda broke my little heart lol
15436,Sold my dogecoin
15437,Dogecoin 🚀🚀🚀
15438,"But doge is a joke, right?
Seems like a repeat of 4/20 but less so. We'll see!"
15439,I couldn’t sell Doge either on Robinhood!!! WTF!!
15440,Did the same on 420. The paper hands can keep selling. Us Dimond hands will profit.
15441,"Buy the rumor, sell the news, as always 😁"
15442,It’s crazy how fictional TV actually effects the way people view reality.
15443,Elon has terrible humor.
15444,thanks for the update governor.
15445,oh my god wut's happening. I am here with. buy the dip !!!
15446,Come on KEVIN he did say that it’s the future currency.🤔
15447,doge is a joke... it has no value....everyone who knows anything about crypto networks knows that.... its gonna end ugly eventually.  If you're in doge you're gambling not investing.
15448,Welcome to OC
15449,"No Kevin, this is simply ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"". Also, why are you trading crypto on Robinhood 🤦🏻‍♂️"
15450,Those assholes are probably bought by the wealthy wallets to crash Dogecoin because it definitely threatens all the other crypto and the dollar itself.
15451,7 DAYS AGO IT WAS 38 CENTS LOL UP %50 THIS WEEK. SELL THE DOGEARMY YOUR COIN THANNKS.
15452,"It wasn’t just doge that they ridiculed, but elon also.....aaaand Kevin is drunk 😂"
15453,The SNL scripts were lame.
15454,"Have none of you kids ever heard ""sell the news""? LMAO..smh"
15455,"Kevin, you’re a brilliant man, I love your content and valuable information. 

I’m just going to say this, it’s best not to over analyze this. 

It is just meant to be an opportunity for him to connect with his more human nature side and have the ability to interact with people on a large scale for the sake of easy going and down to earth fun.

It wasn’t intended for him to give an authentic analysis of any crypto or alt-coin. 

It was just to poke some fun brother, much love and respect ✊"
15456,Just sell
15457,Still holding. Buy the dip. Diamond hands
15458,You knew it was going to dump during the show.
15459,Dogcoin to the moon.
15460,I bailed out of doge at. 72 glad I did.
15461,Cant sell so that the FED (whales) can dump on the little guys.
15462,"Elon said literally,  TO THE MOON!🚀🚀🚀"
15463,Actually I thought SNL was great but of course I haven’t watched that show in YEARS!  I had some good laughs 😂.  All I heard was Elon talk about crypto and mention BTC and ETH first then of course doge.  I’m a BTC and ETH investor.  I Think tonight was good PR for crypto in general and BTC and ETH.  Cheers!
15464,"Idk mayne but a lot of people had the same mentality about doge tonight, but the hype sell the news. I was expecting a bigger dip, to see doge recover the way it is rn is surprising tbh. I’m glad it’s doing this. Idk mayne I’m not agreeing with u on that specific topic"
15465,you better believe I bought that dip
15466,omg drunk meat
15467,It's going up man
15468,"Mother’s Day joke to make it drop, news skit to make it rise! Coincidence?"
15469,Or cancel my limit order I bought at 9am too 35 mins. And just to cancel a sell order. Ugh.
15470,O come on come push it! Buy the dip. Buy the dip! Oooo my god whats happening. 💯🦍🕺🐕🚀🚀🚀
15471,Is Disneyland reopened in Anaheim?
15472,"This was speculated and it dipped...all good. Robinhood and Coinbase crashed. It will continue up again. Hodl the line. Regardless of #Elon, crypto will continue!"
15473,The scripts were awful... also didn't help RH kept crashing.
15474,I know I was so disappointed
15475,"The Scripts were bad, but guys you have to know that Show TV Business is always Rushed to do a Episode. It was a Rush!!!"
15476,Was pretty clear imo that Doge will fall in the long run or at least for now...
15477,Doge has gone from .003 to .70 in less than 6 months 😂 I made more money just holding 300 bucks at .004 to .60 than I did with most of my stocks lol. People getting in now are way late and just chasing and FOMOing in
15478,I thought it was great episode! The only thing was Robin Hood breaking down
15479,That’s why you don’t buy crypto on a centralized exchange.
15480,"But...
But Elon Musk was supposed to be the chosen one!"
15481,HAHAHAHAHAHA I think it was actually great!!!!! If the hype of an investment comes down to comedy show comment and crash a coin by 20-40% then you're really taking massive gambling bet with your money! Which is FINE if you're ok with all the risk you took. [Risk management 101]
15482,How is this SNLs fault????
15483,The dip was a blessing I used it to pump another 20k in
15484,I hope your time off is going well. I loved SNL was great.  I still loved it and had fun swing trading it . Loved it.  Had a bunch of fun.  It was a Doge roast
15485,DOGE🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
15486,Did he glue a beard on!?🤣🤣🤣🤣
15487,"Please guys get real crypto projects! ETH, SOL, LINK, EGLD, VET, MATIC these can change people’s lives. 14,400,000 new DOGE are created every day. That’s 10,000 new coins per minute! Guys please move on. DOGE is not the answer. We can do this together without the nonsense meme coins."
15488,Lol it was something else. Scripts could've been better but I'm a simple man... Dogecoin will stay stagnant for now.
15489,bought the dip at 0.49 not upset at this moment ✌️keep holding
15490,Knew it.  Ethereum to the MOOOOONNNN
15491,"I expected a bunch of people to sell anyway. Bought the dip, now I’m in a better position. This is not over!"
15492,Robinhood and webull going offline through the whole thing didn’t help...
15493,Buy that shiba baby
15494,All they did was shook off all the coal hands. All that's left is 💎 🧤
15495,SNL needed the Hype...
15496,I am skeptical of doge. BTC and ETH is great. I don't own any doge.
15497,Much wow
15498,"Damn, Kevin! Your work ethic, productivity, and efficiency is unreal. You’re at Disneyland and you still deliver. Like how. Just wow!"
15499,I will keep doge just to keep the pump up. For the love of meme.
15500,"Woooooo, bag holders! Let’s go"
15501,It took me so long to sell
15502,"Great on point info and I agree with your assessment 100 percent 
."
15503,SNL isn’t funny and Elon isn’t funny. A lot of clowns got Rekt. Whales sold at 11:35pm EST. right when the show started.
15504,Yay on focus on your wife and family today
15505,"Hey, Doge is holding pretty well. It wasn't a good night; neither was it a bad one."
15506,Kevin why did his mother say that
15507,Why are you guys still using Robinhood??????? That's a better question.
15508,First
15509,dip for everybody else to get it!💪🏻🚀🚀🚀
15510,"Kevin, it was awesome meeting you at Disneyland today!"
15511,SNL has always been trash. buy SingularityNet AGI who’s integrating their ai into Cardano art contracts with their partnership.
15512,Doge is really a big joke
15513,I don’t get why people expected DOGE to be the main show? Just cuz ? I wouldn’t have found that funny or entertaining as an SNL episode
15514,Sold all of mine at .65
15515,Just enjoy the vacation man. its okay to take a day off when at Disney land haha.
15516,You are breaking up badly
15517,"$SHIB stole $DOGE's puppy chow....

15527,You couldn’t stay away.... haha
15528,Tanked
15529,Got nothing to do with the show it was buy the rumor and sell the news!
15530,Pumpers creating a lot of bagholders in doge that are going to lose big when reality sets in.
15531,Doge at 56 cents currently...
15532,Really? I thought the skits were great! I don’t think if they were funnier it would of made a difference. I do agree the Mother’s Day joke didn’t help but the news skit was great and went way further than I thought! And it’s climbing again!
15533,Kevin you’re an idiot lmao
15534,#SafeMoon #SafeMoonArmy

15582,"Guys, people in the real world out there don’t see the vision yet, to the majority of humans cryptocurrency is still a whole new thing, and are going to bring them down and hide them from becoming the thing they are going to be, remember the vision, remember the long term vision, remember why you started investing, because of the future. In 10 years from now you’ll wish you had invested in them this early."

15775,"important points made and it's all great, in my opinion when it comes to the  mother of all coins < B  TC >, B!tcoin is getting interesting every day by day. Alt, Xrp, Link are still lucrative in the market.."" In this case, the Majority are finding it difficult on which coin to HODL better. Right now bitcoin it's in the greatest shape and we are all expecting more of it, I'm currently a HODler but still, I'm using a working system that provides me 80% correct signal which helps me increases my portfolio, now I have less bother about the speculation of the market. I'm still winning by applying the same method in every trad e, you can also become a winner today, I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn’t mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of Technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market ."" so to be on a safer side i advise that we all follow a less talked about way, which is trad!ng. I have been able to generate 9.2b tc with my initial 1.5.Y'all in search of a profitable system can reach out to Mr carruthers on TEIEGRAM(carruthers2) for more insights."""
