I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) .

211,"WHAT IS BITCOIN !!!

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[ Nakamoto's identity remains unknown..

With the leading cryptocurrency by market cap having no clear resistance above it, it has now entered price discovery mode, and where to next is anyone’s guess. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I’m not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 17BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s!gnals from Gavin of cyberhackinggenius. He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market , stack up more bitcoin and he also helped recover my stolen Bitcoin plus an active private key. You make 50% profit as return on investment for every amount invested in exactly 24 hours. He can be reached via gmail (cyberhackinggenius) and What's-- application (+19256795146) for his assistance. Lets be positive and remain winning."

452,"have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience, I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people, One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticising bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset, there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook, line and sinker and of course, those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing.  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) . Persistence and commitment and love for success is what you need in the crypto space and we all can.             cryptoforex60@gmail. Com"

507,"For most investors who entered late last year, the recent historical highs were extremely attractive profit-taking targets. It is the consequences of such profit-taking decisions that we are now witnessing in the crypto market. There is no trend reversal because there is no panic selling. Active asset purchases immediately after the plunge below $30K indicates the preservation of the pool of investors who are still willing to believe in the continued upward BTC dynamics. Market participants are still undecided about the relationship between Bitcoin and the traditional market. On the one hand, the asset has become part of it, as buying by traditional funds ramp up. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the decentralized digital code will ever fit into the market framework, which began working long before the advent of the Internet and computers in general. Investors are looking to make a bullish move so as to earn from hoarding, while traders are earning from price movements. Trading has always been a more profitable means of earning, this has been a major step for me, I have found a crypto guide in Burwell Coleman and his signals are top notch. I must say, I haven’t seen any service as his, I made over 12 BTC within 4 weeks, and this was done solely from my daily trade sessions on my live trading account, trading from my experience is the most lucrative opportunity crypto offers yet, every crypto trader should learn the art and utilize its gains. Burwell Coleman can be reached on gmail at (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom) and teleqram (burwellcoleman) . Buy the dip!"

798,"Have you been scammed by a website, have late payments due, lost payments, and so on? There is a very good chance CRYPTORECOVERYX can recover this money for you. CRYPTORECOVERYX refers to the task of recovery of assets that have been wrongfully taken either stolen, fraudulently misappropriated or otherwise disposed of to remove them from their rightful owner. CRYPTORECOVERYX has three main elements—identification, redeployment, and divestment.

What they need from you:

The company name and web address, as well as any other information you can provide about the company.

Any information that identifies you as an account owner. Email address, phone number, home address, and any other person information used during sign up, as well as your username and complete name used to sign up for the service. If you have an account number or membership number this is needed as well. All emails you have received from this company in any regard, shape, or manner. The total amount owed to you, along with any proof of such. Invoices, screen shots, emailed admissions from them with promises to pay and so on. Proof of what they owe you is of extreme importance, BUT this does NOT mean they still cannot recover your money for you even with lack of proof. You may not have these records...they do!

They will do a complete investigation on the company. Background check, company status (if they are a licensed company), as well as financial paper work filed with their local agencies. Once they have evidence exposing them as a scam or fraud involved in illegal activity, they will contact them on your behalf. They will discuss your case with them, while also pointing out proof of illegal activity. Once they know they have them, it is usually enough to recover your funds fairly quickly. Here is their email address: CRYPTORECOVERYX @ CONSULTANT. COM"

820,"Investment scam is all over the place in recent times and due to greediness people fall victim daily to bogus promises. May i tell you that  out of 100% of people or companies advertising investment, just like 2% can guarantee the outcome. The rest are mere scorn artists who just want to take your money. Thread with caution!

This is also a signal to all regulatory authorities to buckle up. You must know that if cryptocurrency is prohibited in your jurisdiction you do not have business with it. The reason being that when there is a problem or abuse, the investor lacks government protection.

If you sense that you are being defrauded by an investment company there are few steps listed below which could help you to recover them if you have all your proof of investment and conversation history. The following are the process:

Firstly, if cryptocurrency is regulated in your jurisdiction like in the United States, File your complaint with the SEC. Why file with the SEC? Some of these companies are registered and it is the duty of the SEC to regulate them. Filing will make the SEC investigate and bring down the company. This is usually not the case as we have experienced in our quest to recover money for victims of fraud. Virtually all the companies are unregistered and are usually operated by fake individuals with fake identities. So reporting to the SEC may not really do justice.

File a report with any Law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction, like the FBI in the US. The essence of this is for investigation but this usually is not an easy one since most of them operate with fake identities and FBI’s investigation is usually very slow. Making it that before the investigations concluded the scorn would have emptied the wallet.

The next is that if the amount lost is what you can bear, please bear it and invest no more.

The last option is that you should try using virtual asset recovery companies. However, i must strongly advise you to thread with caution because most of these investment companies now pose to be recovery companies and they are out there to steal from you. This is owing to our experience in the recovery industry.

Some people have been defrauded twice because they went to the wrong place to seek help. Do not be desperate. When you send your complaint to contact@activebonorum.com the firm will review your claim to ensure that you really invested with these companies and if the same turns out to be successful, the firm would proceed from there.

Finally, I must advise you to inform www.activebonorum.com you that you have been defrauded due to the trauma that comes with this. Also, inform your therapist if need be."

As we all know the world is evolved already and crypto currency is on a speedy rise regardless. I attended a business submit months back held by Mrs Anabelle in the United Kingdom. I never had any knowledge about how it is being done, until Expert Mrs Anabelle gave some speeches and broke each stage in details. I was able to learn strongly underperformed bitcoin processes during BTC's move to $18, 000... In fact the most recent rise from $13,000 to $18,850. I decided to invest with $5,000 and in interval of 14 days business trading with Expert Anabelle I was able to earn a benefiting profit of $19,820. 
I got this idea from a friend who is a beneficiary and a witness of Expert Mrs Anabelle Trading techniques and this worked for me countless times.
... I steady invest again after every 7days interval in her platform which was held late 2018.

910,"I have traded with this 24option and I can tell you categorically that I was/am unimpressed by their performance. Having lost almost $150000 to them I decided to withdraw the remaining balance to meet a pressing need but they have found it difficult to release my money. I paid through Liberty reserve and they got my money instantly but when I wanted to have my balance back they said it would take 5-7 days and it's exactly a week today yet I have not been paid. They lied to me that he has processed my money and that it's on its way to my account but it is now 3 days after without any money. I have sent emails to him and he has refused to reply to me and this is somebody that has been disturbing me with calls and emails to make a deposit and trade and now it's their turn to release my money they have not responded. When you check through their website you could notice they don't have details about the withdrawal of funds as expected. I got my money back a few days ago with the help of ACTIVE BONORUM financial builder (www.activebonorum.com)  , the Leading Recovery Intelligence Firm.

1063,"Well I will also say this here... Talking from my own experience as a cryptocurrency trader mostly BITCOIN TRADING as the leading asset, so far I have come to realize that the crypto market is of two sides. As some people will hold and wait for bitcoin to skyrocket so they can sell-off, while others will wait for bitcoin to fall so they can buy at a cheaper rate. However, I see all this worries baseless if they can't yield good profits, my advice still stands on involving in day trading by finding an accurate strategy/daily signals in other to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio. For me, it's been so successful for over 7 months because I was smart enough to find working daily signals which are being provided by a pro trader known as Mr. James Carlson during the first 2 weeks I accumulated and grew my portfolio from 2btc to a total of 8.4btc which you will agree is a very good profit, James can be reach on Telegram (@ JamesC51 ) and whatsapp +447476717980 for more profitable system."

1174,"It now appears that Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have been able to gain the upper hand over bears in the time following the intense volatility that the asset incurred early this week during its sudden “flash crash” that caught investors off guard. Because BTC is now slowly climbing back up towards the coveted five-figure price region, it does appear that it is shaping up to once again see a sharp upward movement that leads it past the resistance it faces at $10,000. In the near-term, analysts believe that the crypto’s defense of key support may be a bullish sign, leading one top trader to anticipate the ongoing BTC uptrend to continue strong in the near-term.

As the price of Bitcoin continues to rush forward and its demand for cracking forgotten passwords increases, services have come up to assist people in recovering their Bitcoin wallets. However, these options are limited. There are also a number of tutorials to recover bitcoins in cases of technical difficulties. Get in touch with MICHAEL @ BTC-RECOVERY .COM to recover your lost funds to binary options and fake hackers. “Presumably the rate of losing coins will go down because people are very much careful about how they are stored,” says Schvey. “People are investing so much money into mining Bitcoin, they’ll take proper practices.” He adds."

Now as I have memorized my passphrase, I could not throw it out even if I wanted to; I can merely throw out the paper version of it. Storing bitcoin on a hard drive used to involve storing tens of gigabytes of data (and growing by ~10 GB per year). The cost of storing bitcoin could be then higher than the value of 7000 bitcoin. (Unless he chose to extract the key to store it on a floppy disk and later download the bitcoin history from scratch). I wonder if he still has his address (public key), though. He could then check whether somebody else has found the hard drive."

$Bepro, previously Bet Protocol provide the base tech for other companies to build applications such as prediction markets, games and gambling platforms on top of - that is their product/use case.

Look up ‘code-as-service’ this explains it. 

The value of the coin comes from the need to hold and stake the coin in order to access the Bepro network, access to the network allows you to make the applications.

Staking of the token also incentivises people to hold it for monetary reward.

They are trusted by well known players such as Moonbeam, Chainlink, Elrond and more.

They share a founder with Polkamarkets and have just Partnered with Kylin.

They have just announced a code base offering for NFT factories (Non fungible tokens are HUGE right now).

Also, they offer multi chain functionally - you can set up applications on either Ethereum, Polkadot or Binance Chain.

Some of their customers include 
Current customers include @Polkamarkets & @Exeedme

By  the beginning  of this weeks trade session, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that tradlng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Martin Sawyer program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2.6 Btc with Martin's  help.

Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newb!es whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of trad n. I wept deeply and prayed after the last time i had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to Expt.

2143,"Bitcoin isn't really decentralized. It has no actual value at all. It has no real use. It's not really scarce. Funds terrorism. It's extremely inefficient. It's extremely risky. It's a bubble. There are millions and millions of cryptos. Anyone can create a crypto. It's a ponzi scheme. It's a scam. And the worst sin of it: it's helping destroy our planet aggravating the climate change as mining unnecessarily and artificially consumes (wastes) as much electricity as countries like Argentina. Bitcoin can make 5-7 transactions per second, while the Visa network can perform 24,000 - with the energy of one Bitcoin transaction, Visa can make 500,000 transactions.

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Raymond who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months.

2259,"some say the market is crashing, I say that crypto is going on sale...   You don't lose anything until you sell, so don't pay attention to your portfolio value unless you are planning to sell.   So many people say they want to ""buy low/sell high"", but they get scared when it is low and sell their coins, and get greedy when it is high and buy more.  Learning that is when you start to make money.   ""be greedy when everyone else is fearful, be fearful when everyone else is greedy"" truly is the most important concept in trading/investing."

I hold many cryptos and every one of them dumped, I cut my losses on most of them and sold only to see them pump the next day but they never hit the price I bought at. I don't think we will see a 530$ aave anytime soon so I cut my losses on that and sold at around 320 bucks. Eth I got in at 1860 and sold at 1300, that did eventually crawl back up but it didn't show any signs of life until after I sold."

2382,"Nice content you put up always👌.BTChits a new bullish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see how the market is very unstable, the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just holding and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket. Indeed it's a tough decision for both old and newb!es whose intentions are just to hold and sell but rather the potentials of trading.I wept deeply and prayed after the last time I had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to Expt. Brock Pierce. who I started trading with since late last year, I've covered up and made over 21 B T c even with the ups and downs since the journey.

2454,"OK I 'm a newbie, I get supply and demand, as well as a stock price.  Help me explain- If a stock starts at 1 dollar, and there's high demand, then who is the one saying "" ok now that everybody wants this stock im going to raise it to 2 dollars? why doesn't the stock just 'run out' at its in initial dollar value when its listed for sale.  There must be an actual formula or something that automatically raise the price from a dollar as people buy. Who is it that's actually observing the pool, and calculating the new price, as more people enter?  Is it a computer algorithm? I mean it's got to be a person or something that raises the price, up or down? I don't know if I am making since? From my point of view, little digits move up or down on my screen faster then any of us can predict, based on volume. I'm thinking there's a fearful/greedy man on the other side of my screen (they, we, wall street, computer robot?) changing the price. You mention the social diversity and perception is unique about the Market, but that's the public now who is the referee for the price changing, because buyers don't want the price to go up, unless they become sellers. Thus a feedback loop is created, due to the fact I can't predict what john doe is going to do with his stock, and the companies reputation.  Ultimately something is determining the price base on several factors, I get the public, and the apparatus, but not the formula and how its used and implemented, as I see market inhale and exhale as it lives and dies."

2490,"I sold my ETH, not out of fear it wont pump. it very well may. But even if it 10x im not mad to have sold. Ethereums fundamentals are pretty pretty bad compared to other projects right now. But i feel like people who were around for the 2017 bullrun are massively blinded by experience. Back then there was nothing to pump except ETH, so i feel like people now expect it to do the same. But why would it? We have loads of better alternatives to invest in compared to 2017, and the market caps are way lower than ETH too. Maybe im an ""ETH hater"" but im pretty sure this is an emotional investment at this point, rationally, i dont see it making any sense compared to alternatives."

Price prediction for that alt coin is ten dollars this year, if it hits the mark, that 4,000 dollar investment a year ago would be 1 million at the 10 dollar mark. If someone would have gave a bit coin worth 40,000 a year ago they could have cashed out at 3 million yesterday. 10 million if they held for the 10 dollar mark. I think enjin can do it.

2525,As an Indian let me update everyone - The finance minister confirmed a few days back that they will not be banning Crypto. The only institution which wants a complete ban is the central bank of the Country (RBI) but the government wants to take a more pragmatic approach.
2526,"At the point when bitcoin hits sixty thousand , which has for some time been probably the biggest position , changed over piece of its monetary record money into bitcoin recently . Different organizations have additionally progressively embraced digital currency , either by supporting installments and moves or really purchasing the assets . The Bull run has begun an it is simply shrewd to focus available . As hard as it is trading Crypto , it sure is much more rewarding and is very sensible on the off chance that you simply learn and focus on what's happening , I'm not a genius trad er but rather I was sufficiently fortunate to make 29BTC since toward the end of last year following the instructlons and signals from Garric Norman .

2528,Bitcoin will drop 40k
2529,BitBoy sit down and take notes mate!!😉😂
2530,We are looking at an extended bull run. The first peak of several may be September but the amount of capital yet to flow into the space is massive. Scales of magnitude higher. Which will take years for the capital pool to fill up. When you see bitcoin being posted all over Facebook or your local bank offering “bitcoin savings accounts” is when it is peaking. I suspect it may be around 2025 when the bull run really cools off.

2636,no joke my grandmother has the same haircut. verrry niiiice.
2637,Everyone's bearish all of a sudden. I'm adding till the end of time.
2638,"Sheldon, I have been around since early 2018 for crypto and have sunk all of my extra cash into Crypto since then. Your videos are so great and give me a great perspective of the market and crypto projects. Keep up the good work."
2639,"to be honest, I would welcome a BTC pull-back. I feel like I have not bought enough and that would be an opportunity to buy at a discount"
2640,"March is also a bearish month for the stock market (last year was way worse, this year turned out to not be as bad as we thought, so far). Crypto tends to act like stocks as opposed to bonds (obviously), so it isn’t surprising that March would be rough. I thought March would be a lot worse tbh, despite the huge red in my stock brokerage account this month. It came back well recently.

I’m green on half of my stocks now again (all the big ones are looking amazing), got great prices in the huge dip, and also I got ETH (first crypto buy ever), so I’m pretty hopeful right now. I’m up on ETH even during this local low."
2641,Hey Sheldon you are the man great advise. You cant panic and I appreciate your honesty and confidence.  I look forward to your videos and thoughts Thanks and so much respect for you.
2642,U are the best
2643,"On the weekly,  I noticed volume and RSI declining.   Coupled with price rising, isn't that bearish?"
2644,This is a quality over quantity channel 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
2645,BEPRO doing big things!! Team and project as solid as they come
2646,"Dear Evans, please review about DREP for small investor...."
2647,Matic/Polygon is sorting the gas fee issues no?
2648,"Bitcoin has just hit a new all time high of 61,844 a few hours ago and now it is correcting a little bit.  I hardly think that it's ""dumping"" lol.  Such an alarmist title  smh."
2649,what a good looking guy and know crypto language (hot).  If I were single I would have travel there and knock on his door. (saddened)
2650,"When you scale out, do you move it into USD? Do you then wait for the dips or better yet, the bear market to buy back in?"
2651,"thanks Sheldon, very informative video!"
2652,"Sheldon, what can I use to keep track of all my crypto.  I am using 3 different exchanges and I need a way to follow all of  p&l together.  Please advise.  Thank you for your good work!  Appreciate you!"
2653,What are your thoughts on the Flexa network?
2654,GRT
2655,This guy kinda looks like a greyhound
2656,"Can you make a video on Voyager and VGX? Great platform and app with a lot of utility, backed by an experienced team (former CEO of E*TRADE) and already publicly traded. It will be like the Robin Hood or E*TRADE of crypto and offers high interest rates to hold coins. A ton going for it but doesn’t seem to get a lot of attention, feels like a hidden gem"
2657,Why are people called sheldon always so damn clever
2658,20:07 Girls hate this trick.
2659,"If you use Satoshily Exchange you can get USD for your BTC the same day, no ID needed."
2660,New to this should i buy £1000 worth of Bitcoin now and will i be in profit by late June?
2661,thank you for this calm video on a train wreck of a day lol
2662,what you think will happen with xrp?
2663,Love your videos bro keep up the good work!
2664,Great analysis thanks Sheldon ☺️ I have learnt a lot from you!
2665,Measured outlook as always Sheldon. Would like to hear your thoughts on Dego Finance next time you do a video on low cap coins. Thanks for the content
2666,"Hi Sheldon please give us more information about your standard Patreon.  Eg how often you put out content, interaction with clients, tips etc."
2667,16:16 What's that breathing in the background? Sheldon's boyfriend?
2668,Thank you sheldon.
2669,Great vid.  The psychology you mention is alot less stressful and usually pays out.

2672,"The concept of buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Daniel Wright services. , although i have been into numerous services but Daniel Wright stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Daniel it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel- gram ( @Danielwrightfx )."
2673,Well you take your profit in fiat?
2674,Thank you Sheldon!! Very informative 🙌
2675,Favorite YouTube channel
2676,I'm cashing out in September 😎
2677,If you want to cash out look for a P2P exchange like Satoshily - those traders will usually give a better price.
2678,He's calling our BitBoy
2679,Bitboy subscribers should watch this video instead of wasting their time in such a useless gambling addict channel
2680,"I am from india ,  really disappointed by this move of banning cryptos by this govt. Hope they come around sooner rather than later!"
2681,Can someone summarize what he said? I'm not trying to watch the whole video. What do I buy that simple?
2682,🐂🚀🍾🤑👍
2683,I’m buying!!!
2684,Always  great to listen to your wisdom and truth.. thanks
2685,"Love your Videos
You are just so calm and chill"
2686,Could you please review AVAX? Seems like it has already solved the problems ETH is struggling.
2687,"Hey Sheldon

Any videos on XRP ?"
2688,why would you sit on the side line watch btc go up or down wtf. atleast hold some long-term.
2689,SHELDON........WHEN YOU WILL DO A VIDEO ABOUT YOUR EXIT PLAN????
2690,Support the algo :)
2691,do we really still have to explain to people that the market has corrections?? lol
2692,"Thanks for the educative video.  I'm exceptionally interested at the rate BTc, has played out this year, yet on the other hand I'm dispirited by the rate at which a couple if generally scarcely any Invts. are buying the dive and makin mishap from it. I can say I have had something sensible of loses all through the drawn out I made loses to the extent that I for all intents and purposes quit. Until at the finish of a year ago I was familiar with an Expt. prof Ryan jackson, with his assist I with having disguised and made 9+Btc, paying little mind to the differences what not. with Prof Ryan Jackson asistance I now don't have to worry about the great and terrible of btc, you can without a doubt get to him on Tє Iєɠram@Ryantrading5501."
2693,Bird Money!!!!
2694,Can you please do a video about ADA? Where is it headed?
2695,Student coin ICO happening right now. It looks possibly promising.
2696,Great advice as always. Moar content please

2698,This month i joined your patreon and i am quite satisfied! Keep up the great work
2699,What about holochain (hot) ?
2700,Lost me when looking at past performance as an indicator of the future.....
2701,serious question- Stimulus check on ETH or bitcoin? I'm new to this sorry 😞
2702,"One of the better crypto channels on YT, in my opinion ..."
2703,"With your videos I am under my investment. Your patreon is over-rated. You’re a nice guy, but you are not totally honest on what you do."
2704,Coinbase's BTC price dumped Exchange is still offering $ per BTC and almost $1800 for ETH.
2705,"The most legit crypto channel , i love your calm, your logic in words , i love you😍😍❤❤god bless you"
2706,"Dude, you are the best of them all. Simple, accurated and calm. Thanks for supporting us. Greetings from Brazil!"
2707,"Finally a YouTuber with a common sense, no drama and no clickbait headlines! Love your videos and how much calm and sense you are bringing! 
When you mentioned the products that are being developed you should definitely check Zenfuse platform for trading. When it’s live it will be a total game changer :)"
2708,Mantra DAO is going to the MOON right now! Completely underrated gem.
2709,Bnb too
2710,Wondering to close my ETH long
2711,I agree with most things you said. But I still struggle to believe that none can stop crypto. A government like the US does not need BTC. IF they say the party is over BTC will be some whatever thing for the rest of the country .... and most likely it won't just be the US. I agree you can create immense returns ... probably for the next 3-7 years. But at some point the party will be over.
2712,"This guy speaks only facts, very good content appreciate it !"
2713,Opinion on chz?
2714,"I have a question concerning patreon.. is it possible to make a custom pledge? Or does one only get the bonuses if you pick the availible package?

2718,"Bird didnt pump out of nowhere, mainnet lending and borrowing launched today"
2719,how can you say price predictions are silly when you said eth will go up to 50k?
2720,time to buy
2721,OMI !!!!
2722,What technical analysis tools do you use on trading view ?
2723,"THANK YOU. Everytime I hear all these widespread ""predictions"" I smh people lack the intelligence to see how they are pushing themselves for this to happen (self fulfilling prophecy). I also believe this includes 90%+ of the ""correct predicting"" TA. Many people/whales see the same ""signs"" and move according to it, realizing the prediction which might have not even happened had it not been their actions."
2724,"$BEPRO guys, grab your tickets for Altseason, we goin to mars! Sheldon already talked about it 3 weeks ago, still very small cap, long way to go, don't miss it!"
2725,The only reason somethings has value is because there is someone willing to pay the price . If people think BTC will hit 200k then people will buy up to 150k -180k . That's how I know 100k is guarenteed this bull run . Because EVERYONE IS SAYING 100K MINIMUM
2726,CME gap.
2727,It's possible to get a better price if you hunt for payment methods like local bank transfers on
2728,1inch is coming very stronge!!!

2731,"Nailed it Buddy... By  the beginning  of this weeks trade session, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that tradlng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Aaden Jones program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2.6 Btc with Aaden's  help. You can easily get to him on ᴛᴇʟᴇɢʀᴀᴍ @Ajonestrade   αρρ_+1 407 630 7115"
2732,One of your best videos. nothing but the truth! I like!
2733,Thank you for this information
2734,"The bitcoin cycles can be predicted based on history. I understand you will not get an exact date, but a good window is perfectly logical. It has been so for the past decade. Why would you not assume there will be the same phases in the cycle as before? We're definitely going to reach a peak some time this year (potentially early next year) and after the parabolic there will be a bear market. Industry investment will simply dampen the the volatility and/or lengthen the cycles but this is typical of a maturing asset. The low at the tail-end of the market might only be a 50-60% price reduction from peak and that bear market correction will reduce progressively after each cycle until sometime in the long term, the bitcoin volatility will be more or less stable compared to current."
2735,Thoughts on Hoge?
2736,Dude seriously you’ve been away for a while.... ive been waiting for a video to drop... please try to make videos a bit more often... i really benefit from ur content...✊🏽 peace

2743,"The law of attraction applied to the price of a certain coin, with the self-fulfilling idea ahah
we can keep the bullish momentum if we want then. 

I had a question in my mind yesterday. If a shitcoin is in a bullish momentum, it makes it a bullishitcoin? if you think this is true, like and we'll make it happen. The universe is with us!"
2744,Glad you’re back Sheldon!

2762,I can understand to sell a portion to be able to buy back in later for more BTC/ETH but selling everything goes agains what i believe. My final goal is that i dont have to sell anything and use my crypto as money. I hate banks and fiat money so that is the end goal.

2784,"ETH has been following BTC for last several months or so and doesn't look like anything has changed since. ""Broken"" ETH sounds funny to me as there're so many bullish updates like EIP 1559 and plan to move to to POS sooner than planned. It looks like ETH being suppressed by some forces and this is not just only my opinion."

2913,"I think it should be a criminal offence to pump and dump and other naforious methods obtaining crypto at the expense of genuine taders.
How on other can the vast majority of society have confidence investing in crypto when it is so manipulated. 
Today #btc is hovering yet again been 55k - 60k but as the weekend approached you can garentee the price will fall sharply only for it next week to retrace to current level.
My last point the whales swindle millions of people out of profits for greed. Surely crypto was developed as alternative to the greed and corruption in the main stream financial institutions."
2914,Excellent vid. Thanks
2915,The whales in XLM just did this today. So I bought a bunch.
2916,Thank you. This was helpful education.
2917,"Yeah. Dimon calling the kettle black. He’s such a shameless thieving liar. Always running from his guilt, making him always more guilty. Just another reason to like BTC."

2919,"Talking about market manipulation, I believe one example is the XVG/BTC coin in Binance, where you see a normal behavior to the time frame of the 1D, 1W, 4H, but when you switch to the 1H, 15M time frame you see a complete regulated movement."
2920,"Dont' do day trade.. just sell it, after 1 month..
but must buy at the low Price.

LOW PRICE is the KEY to get the MONEY OUT..!!!! And sell it High!! Once you make 300% That is the KEY!!!
Once you getting into day trade you will lose and win.."

2925,"Informative, and well presented. thank you!!! Guy."
2926,"I've heard others saying that the markets are being manipulated. Patterns and trends that fall apart when trading using analysis that should turn out a certain way... but way outside the normal scope of the varied success that any TA would generally produce. I just watched 14 minutes (3/6/2021; 20:45PST to 20:58PST) where the high ended up at 49,500.00 or 49,499.99 with only couple deviating by 50 cents or so. With an open market, I just see this as impossible. Am I seeing this correctly?"

2948,"Another point for pump and dump- shitcoin may be promoted by Influencers who know nothing about crypto. I was a naive, newbie and got burned. Also, telegram groups who suck people in, don't tell them name of pumped coin until the second they say to buy, so followers have no chance to research. Newbies don't realize the scam is illegal."
2949,"I was day trading fine on Binance, until I started to invest in SNGLS. The recent pump and dump really got me, even though I bought it after the first big dump.
Also there's a lot of manipulated coins you should avoid on Kucoin. Once you buy them, the price will drop and you will have a hard time selling them even at the price of the day. for example CSP and TOKO. Once you sell them the price will go up. It's as if I was the only one who had some."

2954,Helpful contribution. I never thought that we youngsters could be affected. Would be good if we could outsmart the thieves.

2961,"thanks, insightful video"
2962,Great topic. I've learned a lot from you. Thank you!
2963,"oh, shortly... it is about Binance."
2964,I think best way to avoid manipulation is to buy small amounts of bitcoin (only bitcoin)  regularly.  For example if you buy $100 bitcoin once a week rather than buying $10.000 bitcoin at once you don't rekt in long run.
2965,Another way to lose all your cryptocurrency is to fall for that (send me $25 in Bitcoin and I'll send you 1 Bitcoin) yeah ok only a dummy would fall for that bullshit cause there's no such thing as a Bitcoin Generator
2966,Is bittrex a good exchange?

2974,"when Stop price on a Stop-Limit order is hit it turns into a Limit order of a lower price than the stop. it will get filled at the limit price or better anyway, so how does it give you any room to confirm its a capitulation point?"
2975,"Thanks Guy, another great video.
Do you have any views on Tether and whether government intervention could affect the crypto market?
In these unusual times, the central banks are going to extraordinary lengths to keep markets inflated - if there appears to be a flight to bitcoin or crypto in general, it is not inconceivable that they would take measures to prevent this and taking out tether (frequently the token with the highest daily volume) would potentially have a devastating impact."

2989,Long waited for this video man. The community really needs you. Thank you very much 🙏
2990,"Great educational video as always. 
I have a few suggestions for future videos. 
1 - I recently came across BiDao which is Binance's version of Maker. I like the idea of using BNB as collateral and using a trustless stable coin on the platform. 
2 - Also in regards to Defi, I would love to see a video on keyless crypto wallets such as ZenGo or Argent as I feel these are needed to onboard more users into the crypto space.
3 - Finally, in regards to NFTs and gaming I have been following a project called Ultra (UOS) which I consider to soon be an industry game changer. I would like your opinion.
Kindest regards,
Craig"

2996,your my hero !
2997,Love your video but binance is really bad as well and cant be trusted
2998,Nice
2999,"Great vid tonight, Guy.  Very informative.  Everyone new to the cryptoverse should watch it for their financial health.   The SEC, though, is a joke.  Remember the MF Global scam?  An ordinary guy smelled something wrong, gathered up tons of data and took it to the SEC.  Nothing happened.  He sent the same package to them a second time, still ignored.  When the Ponzi scheme tanked thousands of people lost their hard-earned retirement savings.  THAN the SEC closed it down and the CEO got jail time.


Jamie Dimon is the Hillary Clinton of the banking world.  JP Morgue has been manipulating the PM market and stocks for years.  The Feds show up and make a big deal about their trades, fine them $25,000,000 and tell him not to do it again.  It's a joke -  they pay the fine out of the billion dollars made on the illegal trades like paying $10 fine for robbing a bank of millions.  It's a lucrative venture he's got going there."
3000,Please do a review of DOVU’s DOV token.
3001,Awesome and informative video as always! I learned a lot :)
3002,"It's pretty simple to avoid all of these:

1. Don't day trade!
2. Do you own research on the project, team, CEO...
3. Do not think of it as buying coins/tokens, think of it as buying part of companies...Warren Buffet style (BTC included)
4. After you made your research buy coins/tokens it and make a plan (hold for #years,  hold till that price...) and follow the progres of project
5. Store coins/tokens of exchange on hard/paper wallet
 
That way you won't even notice all these market manipulations, because you'll know why you invested your money and what is your plan."
3003,Good Content 👍
3004,Don't trust coinbase They're just like a bank. I spent over $1500 last week with my tax money and they slowly keep taking all of my crypto back saying they never received any of my payments But my bank account is showing that they received the payments. Can anyone help me?
3005,"Save your btc? I used changeangel to swap btc for ltc a while back, i copied and pasted the send btc address. When i sent my btc to that address it got suspended and has remained there untouched.
My advice is to double and triple check each and every key and address. Your cryptos depend on it."
3006,"Great video! I'm new on crypto, and those are really important topics to listen to.
I have subscribed...offcourse!! Thank you so much."
3007,Good video. Thanks!! But I think your VALUABLE information is missing to refer leverage trading and how this casino approach makes greedy exchanges to manipulate massively the markets. Specially places like bybit and the many ‘shutdowns’ of binance.
3008,Brilliant.... thanks so much!
3009,"Very good topic to explain , 👍"
3010,"Another great vid. I know you did a review of Kucoin, but how do you feel about it now? Do you still feel it is a strong decentralized alternative?"
3011,"Good content as always.  Given your interest in DEFI, perhaps a video on the VIGOR stable coin which will be launched on EOS will be in the works?"

3061,btw cellframe has a presale on trustswap. trustswap tokens are now cheaper then ever. down to 3 from 4usd. You need to stake 4000 or 2500 SWAPS for 2 months in order to participate in presales. But it's well worthwhile. I have a swapscore of 4000 which gives me a 1k USD allocation for presales. So far many of the presales have gone up 10x to 20x. The worst did 2x. So I got my money back many times by now. It's all true. Check it for yourself. Gonna get 500 cellframes for 0.1$ I hope. Just saying this for some good karma.

3098,Bitcoin might fluctuate from time to time and that can lead you to losing your crypto if it goes bearish or lower than you bought. Rather than holding just invest your crypto and work with experts. As for me my crypto has been on steady increases working with Susan Bossman.

I bought it between 7k and 10k and I'll be gobsmacked if it goes less than that ever again so It makes sense   to hold a small portion of it at each part of the bear market because in a decade or two, the ""potential"" of btc being 1 mil per coin when it's nearly all mined is very high.

3356,"Bticoin wont be worth anything in the next 5 years because the gov will make their own and ban all others. They don't like competition and at the end of the day they make the laws and they enforce them. They will use the blockchain to enslave us further make no mistake. Either way Silver has held its value over centuries, what you can buy with silver today you could buy decades ago but compare that to us dollars not even close.

3364,"Those pullbacks arenormal for Bitcoin. We haven't even seen yet a pullback as the major ones in 2017. 
It's normal for bitcoin to correct to the 21 EMA(currently at around 45K) on the weekly multiple times in a bull run. We have not done that for a very long time.

In fact, THE;TA was one of the few alts to behave this way since a majority of the altcoin market was heading north in early April. THETA had broken out of its sideways pattern, with the crypt0 breaking south on the back of market-wide corrections. THE;TA was down by almost 24% in a matter of days. What’s more, while MACD line was diverging away from the S!gnal line, the Awesome Oscillator’s histogram continued to picture a fall in market momentum.  I was able to understand the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of techn!cal understanding of how to an@lyse the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Bryant Miller made use of his trde s!gnal services.

3373,"When you mix stuff up and say ""this technology is overvalued"" in reference to.bitcoin, it seems like you're a bit confused. 

I would understand if you would have said altcoin are overvalued, because there isn't a real product just like you said. But although bitcoin is blockchain based too, it is a working product, and already works as intended (to be gold 2.0), and therefore is massively UNDERvalued. 

Plus, if the situation will be as grave as yiu say and tesla will.lose billion, this 3.5 b in projif won't be worth using if you acknowledge that it can 20x in 10 years."

The pr;ce was currently close to the $31.54 support as it traded at $31.75. The convergence of Bollinger Bands indicated that volatility has escaped UNI market; the signal line crossing over the candlesticks indicated a bearish market.

3420,you my friend are indeed the most woke youtuber
3421,"I trust Visa, Mastercard, PayPal but never a new name for it called crypto currency. Invest in gold not a cloud form of it. Bitcoin did sound like it was involved in e money laundering. FBI will have a field day. This is international so they might just ban crypto from other places."

3423,You’re not seeing the bigger picture
3424,"People that lost money on bitcoin,  just didn't hold for long enough..."
3425,Yeah because btc ain't  going to make it. Just wait till the dollar follows! Both imaginary money. America is about to change in a very quick painful way.

Do not pump your stim checks that are meant to stimulate your OWN economy into hot air. These crypto currencies are directly linked to black market drug dealers, rogue nation states, child endangerment and above all a lack of education. Why on earth would you want to devalue your own currency in favor of a digital fiat that will be pumped and dumped the next day. Have some pride in yourself and your country sheeple."
3429,"How did they lose “all of their money?” They must’ve sold. If they would’ve held through the bear market they would’ve more than doubled their money, even if they bought at the previous ATH."
3430,"Just a theory: TESLA and institution already accumulate Bitcoin for along time secretly, but, publicly pump it as collaborate effort, especially now when people are frustrated with 9 to 5 jobs, government, etc., and ready to put in all their money in Bitcoin hoping for changing their life. One day, when the price is at peak, those big whales decide to pull the rug, cause FEAR in the market, people panic sell, it crashed, they bought more, and drive it back up again. Just like they pump DOGE. The more optimistic the market is, the scarier it gets. The more cautious, the less likely the crash happen, because the peak is delayed. The rich got richer either way."

3432,Alex I'm glad I came across your Bitcoin video. I totally agree with you. TY

That is arguably the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life."
3434,"It crashed today, great forecast !!!"
3435,Haha this guy has been in crypto for how long?? What a joke
3436,"This what keeping it 💯 looks like...
Nice video 👍"
3437,"if you dont go for weekly charts (alex is a shortterm trader as far as i know. Correct me if i'm wrong), yeah, bitcoin is on a downtrend.

But if you check out the monthly pattern, its actually absolutely normal. In fact, between 51000-53000$ is THE best entry point right now.
BUT. If bitcoin falls under 50305$, then bitcoin is likely to go into a longterm downtrend.

Its simple. Higher highs and higher lows = uptrend.
If you think, you're in a downtrend, just zoom out.
In the monthly pattern you can clearly see that its still absolutely cool. In fact, since it went down so fast, I can imagine the rise will come even faster. (no financial advice of course.) And I'm not even in bitcoin or any crypto yet. I'm just a guy who did a LOT of chart pattern analysis in the last year (of course, bitcoin is very volatile so it doesnt apply 1:1 and of course even with analysis you are never 100% right). But the chances right now to enter bitcoin are actually quite phenomenal.
But if it falls under said support line, then I wouldnt trust bitcoin anymore for the next weeks.

Simple as that.

If you dont trust me (well, you actually shouldnt trust me since you dont know me), check out rayner teo for chart pattern analysis videos.
The dude explains a lot. But he is more for longterm 1% gains. Still, the theory can be very much applied on weekly or even daily trades as well. its the same logic behind it"
3438,HE IS THE MESSIAH
3439,Ok so you mean like what happened today ?
3440,Wow. You hit the nail on the head. I lost all my gains. Jeez.

3469,"Some interesting points. Institutions that enter now are long term, I don’t think they will go through all of this work and change internally to just sell this year even if its red because they can’t risk it. Sure The early guys Saylor etc can afford to pull out but we are not talking your average pension fund. Second is not the intention of BTC and commodities to hedge against the stock market? I respect and thank you for your views but I believe the narrative could be the contrary. Happy trading, great vid!"

3497,Just read all these idiots comments.  Their blinded by hopes.  Wait until they realize this isn’t a dip and I shouldn’t be buying it
3498,Couldn’t have said it any better.  4 years is a long time to bleed.  I’m loving that all these uneducated people can’t see this.  Sorry just is what it is.  I’m already cost averaging out
3499,"You are right. But. World crisis has been predicted many years ago before the pandemic pressure. We were expecting it without covid too.  Too many countries print money now and there is too many manipulations in fiat leads to a world crisis again and again. If we want to survive without world war III we have to scale into something that can't be inflated this easy.  There will be huge dumps but in the end we have to agree in 1 currency worldwide. Maybe not bitcoin (it will be the digital gold) but an other that's not that volatile. I guess after covid we'll have 5-15 years to change the world totally, throwing our whole previous economic arrangement to the garbage or prepare for a war."

3506,Thanks Alex ;)
3507,Let’s see!!!
3508,I called both bubbles (2017 & 2021) and predicted the coming crash. I love it because when it starts everyone will be clamoring to sell. This will cause a panic crash to lows we haven't seen since 2014.
3509,Wow thank you for be honest with people! I think your correct and I'm already doing and going to do what your saying!!! 👍👍
3510,The people who think this time is different will b making me my money

3513,I got in about a week earlier than this view came out. I messed on the 10-20x so I'm just hoping to catch a 2-3x.

3515,"Boooooo, nothing new here"
3516,"I agree and have pulled my profits after being in it since early in the 2017 bull run.   It's a ticking time bomb of the nuclear variety.  What triggered me to sell is that I had people calling me and asking for advice about it but these were non technical investors, the kind of people that will never understand the technology and how to secure their crypto so it can't be stolen.  I tell them all to diversify half into precious metals so they don't get stung too badly when it happens."
3517,"If history repeats, it will do a massive correction early June. Make now, and jump before then. I like the way you talk about this Alex. It truly is a sober look at the situation."
3518,I think people like you make these vids and then folks see this mess and get scared. Folks like you seem to want this thing to crash so bad. All these big business folks are not willing to let this fail. There are things going on with bitcoin that folks can't even grasp yet but everyone hollering CRASH all the time.
3519,"Well it’s at all time high right now 🤷🏽‍♂️. Also, when you invest it’s money you are willing to loose. Cardano n other cryptos have a lot of potential n ppl are investing in the tech. Crypto solves many problems. You r looking at Bitcoin from a money maker and not in the technology. This way you will loose. Example, those that invested in Tesla did because of the tech, Tesla just started many money."

3533,Called it wrong? 🤔
3534,"The only thing he said that has any merit is if the stock market crashes it will pull crypto down. For the reasons he cited. However he’s wrong on the size of the dip. With the level of usage on the rise, and the new use cases being developed and launched you will not be able to simply sell crypto into dust. It’s currently being woven into are everyday lives and that is what’s driving the prices. 

Yes there will be a pull back but in my opinion I think it will be in the 20-30% range not a huge 50% plus like the past. Btw institutions don’t need to sell anything. If the dollar is being printed like funny money and the price of crypto dips then they just buy more crypto. Because they are basically getting value for no value. 

Never sell unless it’s to enrich your life. Otherwise hold fast."
3535,"The truth is, Bitcoin isn’t stable.  Its value is derived off of the $.  So lets say the economy tanks again, ppl will go to the most liquid source of cash, they will frantically start selling bitcoin for safety to pay their bills.  Right now, we have some big players in bitcoin that are manipulating the price (unethically), to rip the poor small traders off.  That’s how I see it, being in the banking industry for over 13 years..."

Even if it possibly survives,  since nobody actually ""knows"" how it will react when the market cooks,  the IMF is hot on their ass with a currency that has zero backing and they structure alone that will be the new ""currency"" you heard it here first"
3553,"So if you think its going to see over a million a coin, why not just hold?"

3556,"Zero Bitcoin experience, but if everything is suffering and these companies are doing well with Bitcoin, and they sell to fix their profits, then that would just be a standard correction even built on the strength of Bitcoin. Just a thought, what I worry about is major electrical infrastructure problems in the USA. I’m thinking about starting to invest weekly In Bitcoin. But I’m a total noob lolz and know nothing."
3557,Really there’s no way to know what will happen. Lolz
3558,Elon will cash out btc or loan from it?
3559,I hope it’s a catastrophic crash...so I can buy more cheaper!!!!
3560,lol
3561,"Sure all the crypto coins will crash  this been happen over and over for the past 12 years already the end of the 4th year, I be ready when that happen to buy for the next 3 years and be ready for the next bull run , this is normal not to be scare"
3562,They only lost cos they sold. If they didn't sell they would be way up now wouldn't they. More about patience.
3563,Anyone who sell their bitcoin for fiat don't understand how the economic machine works or the fundamental of bitcoin...just remember there is a shortage of bitcoin....this is FUD

3566,"Money is money, doesnt matter if its ""house money"" or your bank money. A loss is a loss... don't pretend its ok to take risky bets with house money and dumb to take risky bets with your bank money. 

Thats like buying a stock high then watching it dump then buying lower so ""i got a lower average price so its okay"". No the first buy at a high price will forever be a shit decision."
3567,"hi alex, do you think bitcoin or another crypto is somehow involved in the 'war of the next reserve currency'? do you think us dollar has come to an end as the leading world currency? is that stupid panic and complete nonsens?"
3568,LOL what is coming??? CRASH??? what do you smoke???
3569,Tesla's are cheaper...
3570,Investing in crypto now is very cool especially with the current rise in the market now
3571,Wrong
3572,So accurate dude I subscribed. Btc losing dominance to altcoins now which is a sign of incoming crash exact same cycle as 2017 (after altcoin like pancakeswap increase abit)
3573,I guess he hasn't heard about Vechain(VET)
3574,Click Bait for sure
3575,"Completely agree mate, this could be the best time to pull out, being greedy never works"
3576,You must be clueless if you think Tesla would need to sell their 1.5billion investment for 5billion to stay afloat or to please their shareholders. Elon musks personal account could easily cover that sort of loss if push comes to shove so they will not undermine their position like that.
3577,So in the video you say you don't think Tesla is selling. So the title is clickbait
3578,I hope they pull I missed it when BTC was a few cents I wanna get in :)
3579,But how do you measure if btc is overvalued? Its not like with stocks where there is p/e ratio and stuff
3580,Alex great rant about the reality and egocentric crypto mania. Will have to see if your crystal ball come to fruition.
3581,"New solid state battery tech could make electric cars technically cheaper than gas vehicles. Some are talking early 2022. Check out ""glass battery"",  it's looking to be a game changer!"

3583,"Another dude with an opinion and a microphone.  I heard btc is going to a million dollars.  None of you have anything to back your opinions up, so why waste time talking about it?"
3584,Lol dude you have no clue. Nothing but conjecture.
3585,Folks remember btc has been moving upwards from last year so  correction is necessary
3586,"People have been predicting the crash of crypto since it was created. Every month a new theory emerges. But all of these theories are based on traditional financial models, which are ultimately based on traditional currencies. We are in completely new territory the laws that apply to fiat does not apply to crypto. I think prices may dip, but those dips don't last as long as in other financial instruments, and even less so now we have Dex and DeFi. So I think you're soothsaying is gonna backfire."
3587,"Wow !!  I just got my bitcoin and working on cc's from *Dumpsmill* on telegram, he is honest, reliable, and trustworthy.  Thanks man"
3588,"Wait why would they sell all their Bitcoin, when they could just borrow against it and dont pay any taxes on their profits?"
3589,Deluded person 😂😂
3590,Whatever mate 😁
3591,you think you're bigger than the game.
3592,"I watched “The Movie Titanic” last weekend on a whim and for some reason the conversation during the scene where the great architects, engineers, investors, and captains of that time discussed the unsinkable ship made of steel because they were so sure and also believed in the structural settings of the ship. The iceberg slicing through the side of that big steel ship came to mind when the steel analogy was made, a steel boat with an unexpected hole in it gliding pertinaciously across a big ocean fills up fast with water and can most definitely sink fast. it’s ironic that in that scenario there was only enough off ramping for the wealthy to do passengers, most of the average everyday passengers with a dream were stuck on a sinking ship drowning them, I’m hoping there isn’t an iceberg in these crypt0 waters and at the same time taking safety precautions through tra:dlng with the aid of expe:ts and pr0 tra:ders.

3597,Nice verbal diarrea
3598,His hands are clean
3599,*RESPECT
3600,This dude sounds so stupid 😂
3601,Dollar average saved me so much as a new investor I never got the best gains but it saved me from not winning anything or losing when I sat there for a whole day waiting to win. However I soon got better and my dollar averages got better
3602,Writing has been on the wall for the last month... You get warned technically long before it happens. The length between the  consolidation and breakout lengths is getting smaller and smaller and smaller ... Now we are curling around a peak... It needs to break a new ATH or else this IS the top..
3603,"I don't think they're gona sell it. I think that Tesla and many others bought BTC because they realized it will be future currency in a matter of 10-20 years. Soon there will be no dollar, euro or korona and there will be one currency that will not lose value. There will be only so many btc on the market, a pint of beer will cost 0.0000000001 btc and never go down in price (as a cause of inflation or deflation as it is now with those shit currencies). THat's why they won't sell it. When (as you said) btc will reach something like 2 to 5 million dollars, people will no longer hold fiat money. Goods already are being sold in btc and soon we will see plane ticket prices in btc. More and more companies will be accepting btc until all central banks will crash and all those manipulators will lose power. That's what's internet about. This is new technology, people were afraid of electricity at the beginning, even in some countries people would use sickle instead of scythe for many decades to cut wheat because they thought it was a blasphemy or something stupid like this. Tesla is not selling, chill out. Of course there is risk, that's why Musk and others don't put 100% of their wealth to btc, only something like 5%, and that's reasonable for everyone to do. I am more afraid of those snakeface bankers like the boss of european central bank who couple of months ago announced they want to regulate btc and it crashed like crazy. Most people are feeble and stupid and they'll sell as soon as they hear some bad news, but unless governments will ban it totally, it will not die off."
3604,“You silly goose”
3605,"You are so wrong it hurts. You have no idea what bitcoin is and it is about to go to 300k and the it will probably drop to 70-100k and you will say '' I TOLD YOU SO''. but no you did not, you said it will drop now in the upcoming time and you will be proven as a loser."
3606,"Lol, If Saylor pulls, he'll be lynched."
3607,"I hold ethereum since 100 usd , so my narrative is wrong? Don be a pussy , eth won top 10% passing last ath , you must be newbie , for people to even watch this video mean we re still far away from the top, every bull market end up with all people being genius ,not all people being caution , simple phycology,we either in disbelief or optimistic ,not even excitement or euphoria to say the least"

3611,"Hey Man,  it is great to see someone with independent thinking, not afraid of thinking out loud.  You earned my subscribe :)"
3612,Momentum has dried up from BTC. Either it pumps hard now or it dumps haaard
3613,It’s the wrong way at looking at cryptocurrency. You’re one of those who don’t get it unfortunately. You said so yourself in the beginning of the vid. You ought to tell people that throughout the vid. Investing in crypto now most certainly is investing in a piece of a very disruptive network
3614,"I make huge profits on my investment since i started trading with mrs Reina Ben, her trading strategies are top notch  coupled with the little commission she charges on her trade."

3617,"Why would Tesla build 6 nodes and submit code revisions to improve the open source Bitcoin code? I ask myself will we be shipping nickels and dimes to Mars? I can't say Bitcoin is the permanent solution, but it looks like we are heading down this path, regardless."
3618,This is a very fair take.
3619,Tesla bought Bitcoin as a hedge. Elon Musk knows Tesla Stock will correct to $45 a share. Tesla will buy Gold and Silver soon to.. Elon isnt a genius but he is smart and has foresight.

3623,AND IT CONCLUDED YOU WERE CLICKBAIT. IT HASNT CRASH SO NOW WHAT.
3624,I agree 100% with this analysis 🧐

3628,"Very nice and educative video i must say . From a technical point of view of crytocurrency , the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls, as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time, the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens, it might assist the market in reaching higher highs. Lots of folks will do so well in the next bull market but you shouldn't be of the mindset to only hodl, can be very dangerous.

3646,Fuck this will be epic once Saylor and Musk sell
3647,They only lost if they sold.
3648,"Well, if it happens, it won't be the first time bitcoin crashes, and its definitely on the cards again. I wonder why people are so optimistic about it this time, is it just because tesla or other institutions bought some. Never trust this market, learn from its history and plz don't get in when most of the coins are like 1000-10000% up. If you are really dying to invest than wait for btc to dip and when it stop dipping further, buy a good altcoin and make quick profit. Do not hold long term."

The bank can freeze your money for any reason. Or you see people paypal etc frozen for political views crypto is the way around all that. We all need to use it this way and take back control. If your in crypto just to make money please reconsider and get rid of the fiat currency system that your a slave to because the banks just print the big guys out of trouble and our kids kids kids kids, are the ones who have to pay for it. Let the fuckers fail so we don't have to bail them out working our assess off"
3667,The whole point of a crypto *CURRENCY* is that it is supposed to be a medium of exchange. You don't buy BTC or any other crypto IMO in case you intend to sell it at a later stage. That is a greater fools theory type of investment strategy. You buy BTC because more and more people are starting to recognize it as an accepted currency and means of payment.

3672,"Depends if you classify projects as tech start ups or stores of value. 
Overvalued now, if you're directly relating the products to their application. Undervalued now, beyond measure, in light of their future use case. 
And to say there isn't working products is a bit far fetched imo. I'm 100 percent in for crypto as a solution to closing a wealth gap in a global economy,  and smart contracts are revolutionary in so many cases. That's why my money is there, I see a genuine solution to a genuine problem."
3673,"""Cardano doesn't have a working product"". Yeah, they do. IOHK released their Mary protocol on March 1st, enabling multiasset support. They also just became the first proof-of-stake fully decentralized crypto. That's a huge deal, because they just made DeFi platforms viable and cost-effective. Not to mention they created software for using their protocol, ie Daedalus and not to mention the developer tools they offer. That is a fungible product. Not to mention the fiat of Ethiopia will soon be replaced by a Cardano PEG token. In addition, there are quite a few other cryptos with real-world products. For example, stormx offers a cashback program, like a credit card. Their product is active and released. I'm not saying I support it in particular, just pointing out that crypto is not vaporware. There are real applications. 

It's important to offer criticism, but your work is clearly not very researched. I've never seen this channel before, but I see there is quite a large audience being exposed to these ideologies that there is no use real utility in consensus technology, which I find kind of absurd."

3677,Settling up an investment that would benefit you is something one would be aiming towards. I wasn’t really a fan of online business because I have actually been doubting this all my life because I have been taken before by several scammers. But after my encounter with AUSTIN my prospective of online trade changes and I I’m now a millionaire from bitcoin.
3678,So if it's all about what crypto gives you in FIAT...THE USD RULES...then..
3679,"Exactly that's another good point...I got in around June of 2020, so I have a buffer, which is why I downplay the crash possibility (cause whatever, if bitcoin goes in 24 hours from 56k to 36k....it would suck but whatever)...but I'd someone got in in like December, they ate still in good profit but they may not have time to react once they realize the runs over...gotta be paranoid"
3680,"The fact that you said this is gonna get you a lot of hate...but i got destroyed in 2017...this isn't how it works...you need to be PARANOID...every pump you gotta take profits and you gotta learn to be happy with what you got...if you watch your tokens moon and ur out, show gratitude that you won and many others did not...nothing goes up forever, you WILL get a new entry point...how many times have you ever perfectly held and had it work perfectly to the moon on some big uptrend (almost never), likewise how many times have you sold after a huge dump and had it never go back up (again, probably never)...be paranoid and you'll be fine, you should be more scared on pumps for what will hsppen in 24 hrs"
3681,if you think bitcoin is overvalued (in the long term) you dont understand it

If you sold after the crash of 2018 then yeah, you missed out the crazy gains this year (three years later)"

3689,"Very Insightful content 👍🏻 However personally I feel, those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in crypto currency world in general or probably just naive, crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions. I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, they loose their investment. I'd strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst of Aaron Addison. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 6.4 btc in just 5 weeks.

3693,gpu back now?
3694,I hear you man. My level of risk aversion doesn't allow me to feel comfortable trying to sell right at the top. 😳

3701,I sold in 2018 bull run. If I held longer term I would have had over a million. When I try day trading or short term holds I always lose. This time I'm in for 80k and I'm not selling.
3702,$235k is what your 1 Bitcoin would be worth today 04.07.2021 instead of $58k had you happened to swap your 1 BTC for THETA on 01.01.2021. Wow a $177k gain in 96 days and Theta hasn’t even got going yet!!
3703,If you can’t predict when it’s gonna happen what’s the point of this video. I can keep yelling it’s gonna crash it’s gonna crash. And it doesnt happen and doesnt happen. And when you say it enough and at some point you can be right. But anyone can do that..... Because everything eventually goes up and down... pointless video!!

3712,"All I hear is ""they lost all their money"". If you wouldve bought BTC at the peak 2017 you would've tripled your money till now if you're not a leverage trader.
And if you had lost millions of dollars cause of selling in the bear market. How TF did you get these millions with this trading strategy.. 🙄"
3713,"Case in point, a lot of people flooding in right now who have been following crypto for 5 minutes."
3714,great video! I lost my ASS in 2017-18!
3715,"I think those people make that kind of video to let people sell and lose money there is no crash ,bitcoin is going to 1 million $ bitcoin is the future"
3716,I was wondering if you were a fraud. This video proves it.
3717,good video. I think people needed this.
3718,"Just the same way I saw testimony of how Austin helped a man make -$50,000 weekly Profit I tried now am also sharing my testimony with over,$10,000 from the company  thanks for the good did he has done for me for this short period of time."
3719,no one like to hear that btc will crash but it will sooner than we think
3720,CHARLIE LEE did not miss the top!!! He sold PERFECTLY!!!
3721,On Point. Thank You pulled out just in time. Thanks for your videos!
3722,Tesla makes most of its money on large industrial solar accounts. Tesla will be fine.

3724,I only mine and convert to fiat weekly but i hope i can still mine for some time
3725,"Yeah, you're not a great crypto advisor. We're not even on 10% of this Bull run.

Also, nobody lost anything except for the ones that sold"
3726,Talking about AUSTIN he is someone anyone shouldn’t doubt or been afraid about settling up his/her investment with him.i too I I’m trading with his broker service.
3727,"Simple analysis but not trustworthy. If Elon would announce that Tesla changed its mind and it sold BTC, then probably Elons reputation would fall faster than BTC's price after this announcement."
3728,Finally someone with eyes and good logic
3729,"I'm waiting for bitcoin to go to $500 again so that I can buy them for cheap, I'm getting 6 altogether. It will be in a year, started saving $$ now already. Then in 5 years when it goes to $130.00, SELLING!"
3730,"Correct I agree with you, Bitcoin is going to collapse, because the USD is greater and more trustworthy."
3731,"When the average transaction fee is 28,000 satoshi and you buy or hold BTC and not BCH your a quack and a total moron who deserves to pay $57 transaction fees to the blockchainm"
3732,The institutions don't understand what they're investing in?
3733,"You are the best bro, I believe you are bro thanks for the information."
3734,Fomo fools.
3735,Only invest what you can afford... hold for ten years... expect the crashes... they should not phase you. You can take a small amount and trade the bubbles but take the long approach. Also remember what’s different compared to 2017... institutional players... the weak hands in retail will sell to savvy long term institutional investors... each cycle evolves
3736,love ur vid bro. very informative and insightful. thanks so much for this!
3737,"Great video,keep it up!💰🙈💰"
3738,Talking about AUSTIN he is someone anyone shouldn’t doubt or been afraid about settling up his/her investment with him.i too I I’m trading with his broker service..
3739,SO what timeline is this crash incoming
3740,😂This won't age well hahahaha... talk about looking for clicks.😂
3741,"Crypto currency is the future, investing in it will be the wisest thing to do especially with the current rise."
3742,Been thinking the same thing for awhile and glad to finally get my confirmation bias.
3743,"There is a lot of true about what you are saying, but there is also a lot people thinking about the same strategy as you, start pulling out before the peak, take profits, to then come back in 1 or 2 year, but you don't really know what is that peak, neither when, that drawing show's how you are trying to time market, that's extremely difficult as you might know, bold predictions will fail"
3744,"Totally disagree that BTC and crypto is a zero sum game where someone has to lose for someone else can be able to win. Crypto is eating gold, stocks, FIAT even real estate, basically outperforming any known asset class in the world, and money will keep flowing in from these assets for decades to come. BTC's store of value is also very real despite its volatility, outperforming gold X100 in the last 10 years, so sure we will continue seeing dips and profits being taken off the table, but BTC overvalued? I say it is undervalued and the reason why banks are predicting a 300-600.000$ BTC soon. Finally FIAT being printed like crazy and instituions realising what BTC has become and what if offers compared to the inflation of FIAT, makes this a very different beast. Appreciate your courage to share your thoughts though, no doubt unpopular and being considered FUD, but a relevant reminder that there will be a top and a bottom, and to prepare for that journey."
3745,Thanks for giving a different POV on the market. It's good to hear some other advice/opinion then all the bullish news and videos you see anywhere else on the net. It keeps my feet on the ground and my eyes open. And like you said: sometimes it's better to think pessimistic then optimistic especially in crypto.
3746,"You’re a 100% right !!!!! There was institutions going in last time in 2017 too nothings different this time, just more people investing simply cuz it’s the second time it’s a bull run more people are trusting it. It’s a forever hold or take profits while u can."
3747,It will go up or down! BRAWO!
3748,Buy Safe moon befor its to late🚀🚀🚀
3749,1:09—1:16 <=== this is all you need to watch
3750,Cardano & Holochain will replace Bitcoin!
3751,"When you say that ""for you to win money there need to be somebody who loose money"", I think you don't understand that it is not a zero sum game. Tipically, if BTC goes up there is a creation of value, so you could imagine that everybody would win. Of course it won't be the case and some people will buy the top, but I think the argument is just false when you suppose you took your gains from somebody else."
3752,Tesla won't sell...
3753,God this gulpy dude...
3754,Let's not. Next.
3755,you sold
3756,"The only thing governments have left in this recession is to PRINT MONEY, that is all they have.   Guess what, the economy will not right itself if we just print print print.  Bitcoin adoption is not even close to where it should be, not even close to gold, or silver, nowhere near...when institutions really start panicking about a crashing stock market and constant printing (and its not just the USA doing it, the whole world is) they will jump on BTC LIKE Lion on a Gazelle, then you really will be scared because it will go parabolic X2.   I don't think you want to be in the market because you shit all over yourself."
3757,Click fucking bait!!!
3758,"So you think that all this printing of the USD dollar, and printing by other countries to pull their economies out of the gutter due to this COVID crisis, will destroy bitcoin which has finite supply?   So all this cash that businesses are sitting on, and many are, will become worth many times more in one of the worst economies we have seen in the world?    I think your entire stance is based on FEAR, you can't believe that BTC could have risen this fast, but that has always been predicted that it will go here based on past trends, in fact it has been predicted to go much higher than 60K, but you are panicking?      So take your money out, and stop putting up content based on fear.    Why would Saylor pull when he is worried about inflation and money printing??   YOUR SCARED.    This is not poker, if BTC gets adopted by the banks like it has been, this is precisely where the price should be going in fact it should be going higher.  VISA is big, Paypal is big, Coinbase is big.... so you are saying forget what everyone else is doing rationally to invest in this space, be scared.... okay.   Fine, pull your money out and don't post this sort of content unless you have some actual substance besides oh shit.... I am quaking in my boots, I never thought this would happen.    This is exactly what many have predicted will happen just before the dollars collapse, and yes if countries keep printing fiat, the economy will collapse... people and banks and institutions will go to systems like bitcoin.       There is another guy that told everyone that they should wait till bitcoin goes to 12K before they buy some, it was at 30K... and I knew, based on BTC inventories at the exchanges, it was not going to see 20K ever again....   bro jump, do yourself a favour, go back to that fiat if it helps you sleep but don't pull this chicken little shit on the community because you think this was never going to happen.   Many predicted this is EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN, and we are NOT EVEN CLOSE to where it will go when stock market crashes."
3759,"Already subscribed, bro, don’t worry haha
Btw I think you have already been asked a million of questions about CVR. PolkaCover is my treasure in the insurance space. Many partnerships and a convenient marketplace with great rewards. So when are you posting a video about them??"
3760,"The price didn’t go up when Tesla bought Bitcoin. It went up when Tesla told everyone they had bought Bitcoin. And even then the pump was only around 10% and it corrected after. 
If Tesla don’t tell us when they sell the price won’t go down"
3761,Cool edgy contrarian opinion bro
3762,You're Truuuuuuuuuuuuue
3763,Mr Nasser is one of the greatest traders i know and i wish to be like him some day!! he's a man of honesty and integrity and is also knowledgeable.
3764,What do you mean hypothetical lol bro look at some of the legislation out there.. I agree with you but all this is is a shake out
3765,Immediately called the clickbait 😂
3766,Dude you have no idea what you are talking about
3767,"I'll keep it very simple here:  I will never listen to traders with ""rock star wannabe"" tattoos."
3768,"duh...... what is bitcoin outside a tonne of PCs in backyards and no open way of spending it.... add to that there is NO office, NO CEO, NO Bricks, mortar or assets of any kind, No Direction, NO lending, NO fundamental backing. Just a balloon overinflated by people with false hope - how its worth trillions is just a OMFG"
3769,"Thanks Alex, this makes a lot of sense."
3770,hay quá vậy ta
3771,If Bitcoin or Litecoin drops to all time lows. I will assure you I'm putting all my cash from every type of account I have because I like what bitcoin and Litecoin can do and offer. I like Litecoin more though!! So please God let it drop. 🙏 people would have to be crazy not to take advantage of this opportunity.
3772,Bitcoin doesnt Need elon musk 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
3773,Wait. Aren't you that dude trying to get me to sell mini sewing machines?!
3774,"Two facts are true. The US dollar is never going away. Second, Bitcoin and crypto is never going away. What does this mean long term? They all merge together in some form. There may be crashes but not dissolution. Be prepared to watch Bitcoin and the dollar valuations merge and ups and downs of crypto diminish over time. Today we are riding waves of digital currency valuations and risk that will be a calm pool in the decades to come."
3775,Verbal  Diarrhoea!! 🤮
3776,You think it’s going to $2 million but you are trying to figure out when to sell??
3777,They know they cant stop it at this point. Who wants to hold their dollar in the bank when you can get into defi and make 12.5% on your dollar or stake coins. That is the different this time around. Will there be bear markets of course but we have another 6-8 months. Dont forget history every 4 years
3778,not with ETFs that will be passed.....only big dip is if they outlaw it and that wont happen
3779,I was thinking that but we looked at a few records and this bull run will see the summer. Too early to call. Some coins may start fading but do your research and your helfy
3780,"Unless you are check to check, why tf would you sell the best asset of all time?"
3781,This could likely happen. Nice video Alex! Crazy nobody wanted BTC when it was under 4k forever after the last crash. lol
3782,"I was at a retirement seminar and the speaker spoke on how he quit his job after he made well over $450,000 PROFIT within 3months he invested $120,000. I just began investing and i will really appreciate any tips or helpful guide."
3783,"Very rational, and I like the way you have simplified your logic. Thanks for sharing !"
3784,"They can borrow against it and that’s what they’ll do... I don’t see why it would be smart for anybody to sell it makes no sense. They’re not looking for that quick game like us...they’re looking long-term longevity and protection for their business. Don’t forget about COVID + stimulus checks, Coinbase Stock, NFT markets are flying and have a mind of their own! Im missing so much more, don’t think anybody truly knows but this video is off....mass adoption is here and happening, what else do you expect?"
3785,"Most experts are saying Blockchain technology is taking over and your saying the opposite?!?!?

I don't believe BTC is going to crash."
3786,looks like you don't believe a lot in crypto and his technology... :(
3787,Let it crash! I’m $ ready
3788,Yes to everything but it’s gonna be a double bubble
3789,Douche
3790,You don't like your grandma
3791,"That would be great! I am just planning to get into bitcoin, and it would be great to enter at a lower price."
3792,"The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde,has recently called on all countries, G7 , G20 nations, to impose more regulations on bitcoin. She said bitcoin was “a highly speculative asset"
3793,All your videos are hate towards BTC your just one nut sack wanting to get views since your no one anymore with your drop shipping stores
3794,They would of never lost of HODL even multiple big time you only loose if you sell ☺️
3795,So sell ☺️
3796,"Great view of the market.
Spot on"
3797,"If Max Keiser of Michael Sailor sees this video BOY your in a lot off trouble..!! ;-) But Bro, for real... You always keep it real, and make us aware of stuff that is still important... The thing that you are doing is keeping us sharp..!! thanks bro keep those vids coming..!"
3798,I feel like this time might be different. More companies are taking it as payment now so now the currency has real value. The other thing is it is a global currency. You can spend it anywhere in the world  without exchanging currency.
3799,BTT 🚀🚀🚀
3800,"No one in 2017 knew how to time the top, so it's dumb to try to time the top this time, right? But you want to get out NEAR the top because you think that's easier somehow. It's not. Also, hedge funds don't sell winners to pay for losers. They double down on winners. I agree institutions will sell the crash, but your theory WHY is wrong. Their bots will tell them their pot odds are beyond a predetermined threshold, and a majority of them will take profits. They won't react to the crash. They'll cause the crash."
3801,Get out the game then
3802,Crypto always proves people wrong
3803,"Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. The market goes up and down. Buy and hold. You want to learn about Bitcoin, watch another channel."
3804,"I think the exactly same, is just a matter of time."
3805,"First, teslas are going to be as cheap as civics very soon. Second, the market is not going to crash. We just had the fastest 30% decline in history. Very unlikely we crash any time soon. Third, whether it’s different this time or not, bitcoin has increased in value since existence. It’s better to have it than to not."
3806,"Aren't LTC, BCH, and BSV all better than BTC?"
3807,Its awesome. I hope it crashes!!!!!
3808,Somber and realistic video. Lots of people definitely need a splash of cold water into their faces right now.
3809,If there is anything on the horizon that will affect markets that badly that the Tesla stock price amongst the rest of the stock market drop where do you think they're all gonna go? They're going to do a Michael Saylor and turn to Bitcoin. Elon knows this he knows the insiders so Elon's Bitcoin is staying right where it is  I think it's more likely that he'll buy more.
3810,A crash is a buying opportunity for the people who got in late. It’s all good
3811,What a waste of time. Says he knows everything - says hukin nuthin. Goon. He is the guy who clearly will get hacked soon.
3812,"It's kind of like a ticking time bomb, we are all nervously watching our money going up, hoping that others are thinking the same thing unti the storm hits."
3813,"Undervalued is TRX.
Trading volume is greater than market cap. Tether is the only.other token doing this. Look at transaction volume and number of wallets too. Alex - stop buying the hype and look in the blockchain son."
3814,the only question answered is; how do tatted d-bags make money? Bullshit vids on youtube. WASTE OF TIME.
3815,Alright. This didnt age well. You dont understand Tesla at all. I agre with the Bitcoin crash but for very different reasons. You shouldnt talk about Tesla.
3816,This is the most ignorant crypto video I have ever seen.
3817,Wish i could block channels
3818,Are you saying pestimistic
3819,"Every one is entitled to their own opinion, every trader knows that you have bull markets, bear markets, market crashes. As for the over valuation of crypto, I've been telling my trading friends that since last year, the market has tripled since then, that does not mean you can't make good money, but you must risk manage your investments, the same as any other investment. Make no mistake, the crypto market is hugely overvalued, most of the 8000+ token/coins /projects in  crypto have no use case at all. Pure speculation. Your basically buying a piece of code, they are not tangible.
Best advice for new investors, put in your stop loss, raise your stop loss with increments when your crypto rise in price."
3820,"Nothing that I tell you is the truth, but it may be useful. Useful musings."
3821,"What the fck do you know about btc, I remember when you said it was dead, just before it pumped to 20k.go back to your make money line videos."
3822,"Great to hear another perspective, because all the experts called for a eth to be on the moon as of now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3823,"you said it was going to be worth around 1 million or 100K I forgot what price, but then you say its over priced? So who cares if it crashes, if you sell then you lose the money, if you don't then you haven't lost anything. You said it yourself, its a good 10-20 year market, so who cares if it goes to 1k tomorrow. It will go back up."
3824,I think my man is underestimating what Elon will be worth after star link I activated he’ll foot the 5billion dollar bill for the people he is the revolution
3825,"Alex:  Institutions sell their Bitcoin (for USD) because they don't care about Bitcoin and want more dollars.
Also Alex: ""Institutions bought Bitcoin as a bet against the dollar.""
Hellloooo McFlyyyyy. . . . how do you not see the contradiction in your own Premises and conclusions???"
3826,Is this guy serious? Lmfao. I remember when this guy was running ads three years ago selling courses on how to drop ship wolf mugs from Aliexpress.😂

3828,Whelp.... this video didn't age well.
3829,Nice fud loser

3834,TSLA makes most of its money selling carbon credits.
3835,"Lemme give Alex a little lesson. Everything is worth exactly what someone will pay for it. No such thing as over or undervalued. Prices fluctuate regardless of how ridiculous it seems. Every asset in the world is ""overvalued"" if anything is.

3867,When bitcoin crash will be?
3868,I do think btc will come back to 25-30k to get the big boys in. They are just now starting to mingle into it. They won’t buy it at new highs. Goldman sachs just opened up their crypto acces to big investors which wasn’t even possible before. The smart ones will probably short it before they buy it at the dip. Just be aware to sit in cash when it starts crashing and load up when the bottom is in. This will likely be the last bottom.
3869,"Hello from Scotland, bro!
What do you recommend to hold now? Just managed to buy some CVR. They provide staking rewards and free enter to insurance products. Looks like a pearl to me. So is this best investing?"
3870,"First you say your friends lost all their money, then 4 million down to 300k.  But 3-4 years later today BTC is worth 3x more than 2017 ATH.  So worst case scenario they have 12 milly now?  Unless they listened to you and sold"
3871,Is there someone who bought Tesla ?
3872,Loved the video -- clicked dislike because I don't want people to see it
3873,"Lmao chill, take a few drinks sit back and think. If u know the market and compare the source of Tesla’s valuation to other car companies this HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION is possible. Some of you sound like biased reporters, its an opinion. Like everything on youtube, take it with a grain of salt."
3874,"ok, so obviously the biggest crash in history is coming. everything is only going to get bigger and bigger from now on. guess what- the biggest run up is coming too. but the crash isn't going to happen soon. that said, what is the literal point of this video? to spread FUD? obviously TSLA will cash out one day from time to time, and obviously the huge crash will come, but is it imminent? this is legit a stupid video... why not go be useful and tell us about the crash if it's a month away so we can prepare? instead you're telling us 6 months in advance and when it happens, you'll try to claim credit for ""predicting the crash"" wtf?! and guess what, people will follow you just for hope. all those that lose their life savings from the crash that you didn't help them prep for!"
3875,"Safemoon people! Safemoon is similar to ETH, however more valuable. It is cheaper with transactions, faster, more functional. It is currently worth one millionth of a dollar (severely undervalued). 10% of all transactions get burnt which increases the value of the holder. But not only this, 4% of the transactions go to the holders, increasing the amount of tokens they hold. And the best part, not on any exchanges yet, as it is new. They aim to have it on exchanges by August of this year (2021). Beat the crowd and buy early. I bought a week ago and not only has my investment doubled, i've received more tokens at the same time. Safemoon People!!!!!"
3876,Elon literally said the day this was uploaded that he’s not selling even a single percent of his crypto......
3877,This guy always talks about BTC crashing. I’m waiting
3878,20 minute for that shit
3879,I think bitcoin or cryptocurrency is just like a gamble. Because not everyone who invest in it acually profits. Some may loose big time. There is no such thing as everybody gaining profit when they invest. It is just crazy that everybody is talking about crypto and bitcoin and urging you that it is great. So I researched how it works. Some people lose some gain
3880,"Did you just say the biggest crash ever in bitcoin history is coming and everyone is gonna lose their money, but its going to go to 1.5 million in the next ten years no problem? I am pretty sure you did. WTF?"
3881,Biggest Crypto FUD channel on YT. Let’s stop giving this guy attention!
3882,Huh? If you held you would have 5x in a year.
3883,Put your satoshis where your mouth is and get out. Have fun staying poor
3884,yeah.. its true.. if you are a pro trader you will know what will happened.. just look at 1week chart..there is a massive value for downtrend..market is a math solving..just remember that..the massive downtrend it will start next week or maybe this month..im with you Alex..if im not mistaken its going to 4k or maybe 3k..

3890,"March wasn’t the best month for Iltec0in after its valuation fell by over 33 percent. Over the last 7 days, while the alt did go on a recovery run, its prlce was still 18% lower than the prlce range it occupied. That being said, bullish sentiment has built up well over the past few days and over the coming week, the aItc0ln may head towards the $243-prlce range once again. The past week saw the coln’s prlce surge by over 13 percent and if this trend continues, the immediate resistance may soon be overcome. L'T'C will continue to try and breach the $209-prlce level. With strong bullish momentum building up in the L'T'C’s m@rket, it is likely that this level may be flipped to a support in the coming 24-48 hours. In such a scenario, L'T'C may head towards its $243-prlce target and register a 100 percent recovery since its fall in the second week of March. Presently, the m@rket is all about prlce volatlIity and I will recommend new !nvestors and newbies to take advantage of Mr. Vincente Sanz's tr@de s!gnal services. He's a pro tr@der who is helping !nvestors and newbies gather more CRYPT0CURRENCY through his amazing trad s!gnals and str@tegy, with his s!gnals being copied in my trads I was about to gather alot of crypto asset within a short period of time.

My guess is the cash he's holding currently is the most he'll ever hold, essentially an all time high,  from here on out Elon stack's sats indefinitely and at most all he'll ever do with it is operate his business with it used as collateral until the dollars so faded he's forced to stop using it and start spending his crypto.  By 2030 at latest they deal strictly with crypto except when evening up with the Gov on taxes."
4006,"correct me if i'm wrong....

if elon musk owned every bitcoin, will it ever rise in price... no

so how much is bitcoin worth if elon buys 1.5 billion dollars worth, 
 answer is more, from the very minute he buys it the price will climb... and he knows this, so does dick smith, koch and keiser... and this is why they will tell you about this ""gold mine"".  Now ask yourself, how many bought after these nice rich guys did, because this is the true value of bitcoin, everyone buying in a frenzy to get in on the act,  they are counting on it... as if we are all going to be millionaire buddies together.... ""um! is there another scheme like this that's happened over and over again""...   ""Gold"" i think not, if you find gold, the last thing you do is tell everyone...and now that a bucket load of people have done exactly what they predicted, ar'nt they rubbing their hands with glee...But the real question is, when will ""they"" sell, like they told you when to buy, will they tell you when to sell...i think not....ask, why will you never actually see or hold a bitcoin, answer, because it would be counterfeit... the government stands watching, because its total worth is about 20 billion, which is a drop in the commercial ocean...so they are loosing 200 million in taxes... (taxes that is used to run the country) but consider what will happen if it hits a trillion, will they be happy to watch, loosing 200 billion in taxes...  so what will happen the 

minute they find a way to control it (tax it)... capital gains is as much as 50%.. more importantly, who will know one day before, you! me! or the nice rich people... there is one guarantee... when losses occur, it will be mum's and dad's again that will suffer the greatest losses... want a worse case scenario, what if the government suddenly deem it illegal and turns off the connection to bitcoin... you loose the lot...

He even finds a way to spew hate and show disdain towards the imaginary fool falling prey to the “narrative”. We definitely needed a messiah who can enlighten us and show us the path.

4062,"Let’s say a large company like Tesla sells their BTC and takes profit. What are they going to do with the cash they get for it then? Just keep it as cash on their balance sheet and see its value get eroded 20% per annum due to inflation caused by all the fiat money printing that’s been happening? Or hold it long term and add to it through any market cycle, dollar cost averaging all the time? Remember Tesla only put a small % of its cash into BTC, and they have announced they have no plans to sell any BTC that customers pay them to buy Tesla electric cars. They are running a full node. I think the Tesla example is a poor one - Elon did his due diligence, he understands the market cycles of BTC and Tesla will keep HODLing and adding to their BTC through the next cycle, not panic sell at the first sign of trouble. That’s what a retail investor who put their entire life savings into BTC would do, not a major corporation like Tesla that sees their BTC exposure as a strategic asset and a hedge."

4073,"Extremely point by point video 🚀 Well I will also say this here,  Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is great, although trading is far more profit able. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when I encou ntered Eric Clark services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Eric John Clark that has made me over 20ʙᴛᴄ. This is his details on ᴛᴇʟᴇɢʀᴀᴍ ( @ericclark01 ) for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related plans."

4077,"I actually do agree with your statement about being overly optimistic. The point you miss though, is that you are giving value to crypto in terms of fiat currency, but right now a lot of people and companies actually are done with fiat and just want to store this value in deflationary cryptocurrencies. So Cardano being at 35 million market cap does not mean it's overvalued. It means that people are starting to prefer having Cardano or Bitcoin than Euros or Dollars."

4120,"There will be an increase and explosion in the next few weeks that will push the BTC up to $73K  increases. If this is the case, this means EXIT for traders , because we then expect a correction of up to 60 percent. Those who are long invested can sit it out with peace of mind ... Because technically, after the sharp correction, the price will then level off at 57 to 63 and then attack the 90s. This scenario can last for a period of 7 to 15 months. As I said ... long positions, lean back confidently and just don't look at the daily rates. Traders should stay awake from 70 onwards ... A setback of 30 percent in a few hours is normal and the next day is minus 30 Percent in your pocket. I have made over 21BTC profits since October not just by buying the dip but implementing trades with  signals supplied  by  Benjamin Jackson.

4130,"This guy is talking out of both sides of his mouth.  He says one thing and then the opposite in the same sentence (bitcoin is going to crash hard, bitcoin is the best thing ever) Companies who are buying bitcoin are buying bitcoin bc they know the value of money is being devalued by more than 10% each year.  That makes the cash a melting ice cube.  Why would you sell an appreciating asset for a depreciating asset?  Sell your house money bitcoin bro.  If you're that confident.

4150,"Yes, yes and yes.  This is the most sensible analysis I've seen in months.  The last time it crashed, the world economy was going ok.  This time, the world economy will take it down with everything else.  The crash is inevitable.
You might hear people like Pompliano say it's a great store of value, inflation hedge, etc etc, but in reality, btc has NEVER been through a world economic crisis.  Even gold will take a hit when this happens, but it'll probably do a lot better than any crypto."

Once it drops below a certain % point from the ath they'll be a pack of institutions ready to jump in.

4171,Also the fact that you're speaking about it in terms of trade and profit. Meaning you're referring to selling bitcoin for fiat currency profit is evidence that you have no idea about the debasement of the dollar. Why would you trade the scarcest asset for a currency that is loosing purchasing power everyday 😂
4172,"You lose money if you sell, don't fucking sell your bitcoin."
4173,This makes a lot of sense and 100% agree

I like how you are at least transparent and honest in your thinking, and saying cryptos is a world of deception created for the wealthy to suck money out of us little guys. I feel I have been suckered in; in fact, I feel like selling off my itty-bitty amount of Bitcoin ($2,000 worth) and spending some of it on a decent end-of-year pizza party for the classes I sub teach in. Apparently you aren't going to pitch in, even though, as you claimed in a recent video,  you got a stimulus check(s) and gave it away (to promote your channel, no doubt,  which is a great strategy because you can make money off us viewers and use that money to gamble in crypto slot machines).

4260,"Safemoon is looking pretty solid. 10% trade fee. 5% goes to investors based on how much they hold. The other 5% goes to a locked liquidity pool DE inflating the value driving the price up. A bunch of whales not realizing the 10% trading fee, traded in an out multiple times making the liquidity pool so big that there will always be value to the coin with 100s of BNB. The devs don't have enough coins to pull the rug and have come out into the spotlight willingly doxxing themselves. They gained over 140k+ unique bag holders in 2 weeks. Its breaking crypto records. its been going viral on tik tok and massive youtubers like Jake Paul and Ben Phillips have gotten on board. Amazing community. Will be getting into charities. NFTS are in the future with gaming partnerships. Will be on Whitebit and Bitmart soon. We've crashed the BNB network on Binance multiple times, so Binance knows about us. This is no longer a shit coin but a community coin with great tokenomics thats everyone is copyin right now and a dev team thats risking its reputation. When this coin hits .000005 ill be making 1000$ a day in just interest. This coin has earned a mention."

4269,"Great video, very educative, the best risk management strategy for trad!ng is one percent rule that limits your loss to minimum amount. Having a risk management strategy is extremely important for trad!ng, and without a proper risk management strategy, losses can't be avoided. Risk management in Cryp to, Forex, Stock Mar:ket, Options and any other financiaI market is extremely important, and to become a successful trad:er, you must have a proper risk management strategy for trad!ng in financiaI mar:kets. After all, the more you’re willing to risk, the greater the potential reward. I’m not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 8.5’B’T’C since late last year following the instructions and s!gnals from Brad Mayon.

4270,"Extremely point by point video 🚀 Well I will also say this here,  Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is great, although trading is far more profit able. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Eric Clark services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Eric John Clark that has made me over 20ʙᴛᴄ. This is his details on ᴛᴇʟᴇɢʀᴀᴍ ( @ericclark01 ) for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related plans."

4310,"You said yourself you see BTC going to 1 or 1.5 million. The reason people buy and hold is so they don't sell out and never get back in. Most people are bad investors, most people will fail to time the market, OH and let's not forget, you are realizing a pile of taxes when you cash out. I see BTC back to 20k in the not so distant future but if you believe in it, nothing wrong with buy and hold."
4311,why would tesla sell their btc when they are taking btc payments when buying teslas 🤷‍♂️
4312,All bullshit
4313,Quite possibly the worst video I’ve ever endured.

4320,investing in crypto currency (bitcoin) is the most best profitable business or investment anyone can ever think of due to how lucrative it is in the world today.
4321,"#1 Amazon does not pay dividends lol. #2 Tesla doesn't pay dividends either. Also Elon Musk has already raised billions of dollars from investors late last year. They have a ""war chest"" of cash that can keep them going. Right now their biggest problem is trying to meet demand with production lol. Even if people stopped buying Tesla, they are back ordered many many years. Dawg, respect what you are trying to do, but please don't spread misinformation about stuff you know nothing about or even did any type of due diligence on. It is easy to trick your viewers that may not know much about this type of stuff,  but anyone who is heavily in the market or has a fund, these are the types of videos we send to each other to laugh at. People who think they are smart and have done no research or any due diligence on the subject they talk about. I know you make revenue from this video, but you should delete it as in the long run your viewers will lose trust for you as they start actually doing their own research and realize you are actually dumb."
4322,"I wanted to listen and I find some logic mixed with confusion in your story.
[Ur story] I made house 💰 but don't trust the 🏠. Ok Ok. People lost money in 2017. Ok Ok
BTC probably going up to 1M?? Just like the stock market if u believe in the ""company"" & that the stock will eventually go up, you won't lose unless you sell while it's under you're purchase price. It might take years but the price will eventually go up is what YOU said.
Is that the basic picture you're teaching?"
4323,"Unsubscribed, don’t like this clickbait"
4324,Elon Musk: Right
4325,lol you dont know wtf you are talking about when it comes to Bitcoin. Stick to your stonks and bonds bro. I'll stick with Michael Saylor and Bitcoin.
4326,that is trash what you tell there !!
4327,I was agreeing with the video and then I heard him say Saylor is gonna pull out.  Saylor is not pulling out lol wtf he's planting his seed balls deep
4328,"People forget that the only reason it went up so fast is because Elon had a bitcoin party , and companies started buying it"
4329,This guy needs to better understand how Bitcoin can be presented in company financial reports. You'll soon learn they wouldn't need to sell off all their bitcoin for cash.
4330,What a drama queen
4331,Turd
4332,It’s all about trust.
4333,I guess this is where everyone who lost money in crypto and is bitter af is at 🤣

4339,spot on Alex
4340,What are your thought on $UBX? They are doing pretty good and are just entering their marketing phase
4341,2017 is nothing like 2021. Tesla won't sell. The pullbacks are getting smaller and smaller. Institutions are buying the dips. You are wrong on so many levels. ADA has just annouced it will allow dapps to get into the DeFi sector. You are so under educated
4342,"Bitcoin = grand fraud of century, created by CIA and peddled by fools."
4343,Sounds like a video from 2017...lets talk 2025 again
4344,20 mins of nothing but senseless ranting
4345,TESLA IS NOT SELLING 🤦🏻‍♂️
4346,"Funny how suddenly, when $BTC is up, 'media' report bullish articles citing 'executives', 'influencers', 'analysts'. And when $BTC is going down, the news that comes out of these sites is all negative...with negative citations (or FUD). Divorcing the media and accumulating more assets in my Atomic Wallet has been one of my most profitable decisions."
4347,Here is the problem with institutions. They will pump and dump to force you out and take your money. That's what they do. They use AI to beat your charts so if you count on charts 100% your screwed. By November I say everything will be 50 to 80%  less and within 2 years 95% of these crypto will be gone.
4348,I plan to be 80% out of crypto my late September. Hopefully XRP will moon prior to the bear market.

BTC price is in a precarious location, the asset set a new all-time high just as the days goes on but analysts suggest that the latest rally above $ 50,000 could have been triggered by aggressive buying from institution investors on coin base as suggested by the large premium of about $ 350 compared to the price in Binance... The shifting momentum is now presenting in technical indicators supplying bearish movement, adding to the double top narrative that's been building since failing to break $ 45,000. ?? This being taken into a note, it can't be more obvious that trading Bitcoin is way more profitable than just holding and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn't think it was possible to make a constant win from trading until I came across Dr Margaret Chatto program for investors/newbies who understand how trading on crypto works, to help them recover the loss from the crash of stocks, financial markets. She provided me with % 100 signal and with her strategy I was able to increase my portfolio from $ 3000 to $ 7600 in just a week, I was convinced to say she is an expert, with Dr Margaret Chatto help. You can easily get to her with her contact when you call her mobile number, WhatsApp or Telegram with... *+ 1 7 4 7 3 3 4 2 1 4 0*. She will guide and advise you on trading strategies."
4457,when bitcoin is done being mined and it hits its cap i feel like the price will stabilize and then will just remain stagnant and become a safe investment like gold or silver is but imo i dont see it skyrocketing or crashing

4464,Are you from the future? How do you know? Lol nobody knows whats going to happen
4465,This guy must be smoking weed when he's speaking. One sided narrative. Institutions would have done extensive research and market forecast for 1 to 5 years before making a big commitment. You think they would buy btc just to sell out within 2 months? Dont you think they have experts working with them and studied the charts more than you? Maybe you should sell out first.
4466,"I mean he's not wrong. Crash is expected. But I really believe that it all depends how institutions playground with crypto will turn out. If you don't have enough interest in people buying cars with BTC from Tesla, or with other banking institutions not getting enough traffic with BTC - sooner or later expect a big ass dump on the market. It's not about holding and not spending, it's all about adoption - and it's a thin string holding this thing up for now. People don't realise that crypto is still in its infancy stage and are just in it to turn a profit short term with a complete lack of vision of what DeFi actually is and should be."
4467,"Tesla has a bigger cash balance sheet than in Bitcoin. Their bitcoin investment was ~10% of their cash reserves. I wish you had more data points to back up all the stuff you said. 
Also people lost money in 2017 if they sold or they bought shitcoins. It's not really a pessimistic argument."

And it's clear that despite what the FED says, the USD IS going down.  The US is in for a hyperinflationary crisis.  It's a matter of time, and that time is rapidly approaching. More and more people can see it now.  Get out while you can, and start moving your capital (even if it's a few hundred dollars) into bitcoin.  They printed trillions of dollars in 2020, and still request that you pay tax.  ARE you KIDDING? How long is this joke going to last for? Do you know how many Bitcoin will be created? Only 21M. EVER. And roughly 5 million have already been lost forever.  You can either sit in petro-dollars (and by the way, China, Russia and India are now trading in oil without using the USD), or you can sit in the only hard money that truly exists. Your call."

4528,The longer you listen the sweeter the pitch. Enjoy.
4529,So then let's short
4530,Investing in crypto is one of the best investments in life
4531,"I’ll summarize this 20 min long clickbait video to save our viewers some time -

1) You can’t predict the top of the market. No shit. 

2) Tesla will sell their Bitcoin to offset poor earnings after a market correction.

It’s ironic how he hammers home item 1, yet seems so confident in item 2. He also clearly doesn’t understand the value of Bitcoin. All of his arguments are some equivalent form of “number go up, number go down”. The only thing he has right in this video is the fact that he’s not an expert trader."
4532,An honest view on crypto prices 🤯
4533,How much does it have to drop to be considered a crash?
4534,Cardano is safe. 😁😁
4535,Totally agree. I told my friends to buy Bitcoin years ago now all of them are getting in at the wrong time
4536,Great video and solid advice
4537,Your shit is laughable at this point. 🤣
4538,Crypto investment is still the best I know how much I have earn from it and I will keep investing and earn more profit daily with bitcoin
4539,Click bait
4540,"When the Stock Market is down BTC will be down as well, the hedge theory does not make over the fact of BTC being a volatile asset tehrefore the first to dip in a market crisis is BTC."
4541,"Coming soon, Beckers alerts/pumpNDump group"
4542,I don't like the way he treats all crypto like a company. Sometimes just remember its also a currency and being overvalued as a currency really helps the deflation take place help stabilize the currency. Yes a fast overvaluation is bad but over time we need to have currency that aren't government ran but could still handle that kind of load
4543,You were right. I was thinking. The economy will go down and people will go into bitcoin. That bitcoin is going down. How low I don’t know maybe you do. Mr. Becker.
4544,trading right now will be at the of every wise individual’s list. In 2years you’ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today
4545,"who cares if BTC crashes , its a buying opportunity, thats how it works DAH!"
4546,I don't trust this guy !
4547,"Your input is very interesting, thank you."
4548,"For those saying “this aged well”, wait and see... He has a point, and yes you could hodl through the crash... but wouldn’t you want some money to invest when the prices are way down? Hopium is a dangerous drug..."
4549,"thanks for put the subs bro, greetings from Chile!"
4550,"People have a memory of a gold fish. Every single last Friday in a month is the same, futures crap then after it everything gets back to green. And yeah right, Tesla will sell btc after he just made one more foundation for btc as a stored value. YT become no.1 FUDing tool in crypto space and videos like this proves it. 👎"
4551,Crack is wack
4552,TSLA and ETF’s won’t be selling. Elon is a long term visionary. He has already made more profit on Bitcoin than TSLA has made since the inception of TSLA. Why hasn’t he sold already? And funds have already pulled their profits on tech stocks. They switched to oil and shorted tech. They won’t give a shit about the 1-5% of their portfolios that is in crypto (as a dollar hedge mind you).
4553,ok Alex sell your btc
4554,You can smell the crash around the corner
4555,Elon is the one pulling out so he can swoop in and make billions entering later at 42k
4556,Yeah and this guy making the video will be right there to buy up your bitcoin at a discount after he finishes his fake video. Ask him where he bought his crystal ball or does God talk to him personally or maybe he has a time machine and talks to Dr Brown or Marty McFly from “Back to the Future”. If it does crash it always comes back if you are a long term investor! Don’t listen to him or his Crystal Ball.🤔

4563,Aren’t you one of those bs drop shipping guys that sells “courses”. Suddenly your an trading expert now? Gtfo lol
4564,this guy clearly doesn’t understand crypto   what a zeek
4565,"""What if I told you...institutions selling then buying it back would actually keep bitcoin at the same price...."""
4566,Is it even worth listening to this? How embarrassing. This guy is a shorter and was hoping to get people to dump.
4567,The institutions want to fear monger you into selling so they can buy your discounted crypto and better control the market. This dude is doing the same thing on a smaller level. He wants to drive the price down so he can get more. That’s what all these YouTube crypto gurus do. They pull your strings from their platform to manipulate the market.
4568,When you join a cult you can never quit!

4580,"What I don’t understand is why would someone cash out BTC, pay taxes on capital gains,  then use the cash to buy a Tesla?  Also, with Bitcoin price fluctuations,  they could be losing money during the transaction to buy a car.  Can someone explain why anyone would do this?"
4581,Cap

4594,Buy gold n silver Alex .Do you need any ?
4595,"I think he's totally wrong on buying electric cars after a stock market crash. Does he think people who buy Teslas are taking money out of their 401k to do it? Out of their investment accounts? No. People who can afford to have a luxury electric car are likely paying for it out of their monthly income, and that monthly income won't necessarily change just because their retirement accounts took a dive. People may become more defensive with their spending when their nest egg is minimized, but I don't think all of a sudden Tesla sales will go to nothing...

I do agree that people will sell their stock, and I wouldn't put it past Elon to sell Bitcoin if they need to cover losses. Great points on funds selling to offset losses to bring in more investors."
4596,Doge won't crash

You say your sure bitcoin will hit $1.5m-$2m  per coin in 10 years.. quote  'no problem' 

Yet your friend said he is going to start buying amd selling coins, if they go down no problem he will just hodl and you mock him.

So if you actually believe what you are saying, surely you would be advising that BTC is a safe bet to play around with, take what profits you can along the way, if it drops no problem it will be $1.5m-$2m in 10 years anyway, basically advising it would be a solid LTI from which you can also take profits and buy dips as and when."

4638,Elon musk literally watched this video 2 nights ago and said hold my beer 😂. I wake up and this is the first video I watch then I turn on the TV and see the tesla news...about tesla launching a bitcoin node!!!!....most people missed that part of the news

4640,"l recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get person who invested with her

let's gooooo"
4641,Well lot of people don't understand how bitcoin goes and they wouldn't want to learn from others and see how it goes and works. Last week I met a trader with an awesome strategy Mrs Maria Jones
4642,Saylor won't sell
4643,"🤔🤔🤔 well number one if you knew a lot about Tesla you would know they can hold that $5 billion and lose that 5 billion and write it off on taxes and they would still come out ahead think about the taxes the billions and tens of billions of dollars a year they have to pay and Bitcoin would be a write-off if they lost it so that's the win-win situation either way.  You didn't think that one through...
   However I'm with you on the rest of it you know I don't think people are loyal to bitcoin I don't think none of us are I think it's all about money.  but you have to ask yourself when are you going to pull out and how would you think that you could see it coming how are you know when grandma's coming? We watched to hit almost $60,000 and overnight lost 25% and a flash crash you didn't see everybody panic and throw everything out and everybody go running that's 25% that's huge overnight that didn't even happen before that happened within an hour's so think about that. It is a little bit different this time.  do I think it will crash? Of course it's going to crash but I don't think nobody will see it coming I think it'll all happen within 2 or 3 hours it'll go from $88,000 give or take 20 grand. down to four or five K"

4662,Thank you LEGENTHACKESS for saving my family from poverty you’re a Gôd sent
4663,Do all alt coins fall with bitcoin?
4664,"They dont loose money first they pump btc and in a flip they changed it in xrp .
""Normal people"" will be broke."
4665,The title isnt clickbait lol wtf
4666,"Don't worry. Fret not. I'll take all the hard work in order to maintain the BTC stable. If in a year, the BTC is alright, then you can thank me with some goodies."
4667,1.4k people dont like the true!
4668,This man on !!G is my life saver and I can’t imagine my life without him Legenthackess on !!G thanks a lot
4669,"Well well well, how the turntables"
4670,"Flawed thinking. Who would be dumb enough to sell crypto for fiat? Crypto does everything better, faster, cheaper, quicker. Most ain't going back to fiat once the benefits are realized. The only argument is that it is volatile, but if we never go back to fiat does it matter how volatile the  USD/BTC pair is? Young people will be paid in crypto buy things in crypto and will never need to have an account denominated in USD. Inflation, Debt, money printing, low interest rates, govt regulated, centralized, counterfeitable... No thanks. Given a choice, adoption is inevitable."
4671,This was probably the realest take I’ve heard so far
4672,"So, Tesla is selling????? 

Hahaha, could've fooled me. They are doing exactly the opposite. 

Where do you get your fake news from???? 

Your arrogance gets the best of you at times. 

Money does not = intelligence. 

This bull market is in its early infancy. 

Do your homework before you make erroneous statements. 

Tests is selling, unbelievable!!!!!"
4673,You know you're in a bull run when this guy makes videos about it
4674,I Invested in Crypto and stocks but believe me crypto is better than stocks 💯
4675,If this doesn't prove you've been full of shit nothing will.
4676,Feels like there is too many adds...
4677,You just earned another sub! Great video
4678,"No, and no."
4679,King of click bait
4680,"I agree with you -  this video is what I’ve been saying for over 6 months now.

Here let me be clear-  when the FOMO hype is gone Bitcoin will fall to its Fundamental value (trust me it doesn’t have much uniqueness USP unique Selling Proposition). 

Bitcoin price is currently 80% FOMO Fumes/. 20% Fundamentals/ 90% Ignorant Investors sheep ready for the slaughterhouse"
4681,How about ppl will measure their profit with bitcoin because of too much money printing? Who what’s to convert to bad currency to good currency
4682,This video is so pointless and lacks any real concrete evidence. Such a shitty baseless take. I hope no one listens to u seriously
4683,"You’re missing a little bit of information the people who started PayPal we’re looking to make and alternative currency. Both of people sold PayPal .  All the people at the partners surrounding Pay pal are now bitcoin enthusiast. Do you really think the only guy that didn’t get on board Was Elon. When asked what it feels like to be the richest man in the world now he replied “I thought I already was”. If you think he just got in at 40,000 I might rethink that if I were you."
4684,thank you MR 100 shitcoins what will Kill Bitcoin for your advice
4685,Companies gonna flip sell this bitcoin/ crypto like fucking no tomorrow. Everyone’s in it for the money 💰 people are getting so fazed from reality
4686,"Great video. It ’s a must to build multiple streams of income especially in this period of the pandemic. Also, have in mind we don’t know if or when another pandemic can happen. So now is really the best time to start pushing a side hustle because no one can fire you from your own business and well your 9-5 we all know how quick they can get rid of you. If you have to work to pay bills by all means do what you have to do but make sure you get your priorities together. I've been doing that by investing in the stocks, bitcoin and financial market and I'm grateful to say I've earned a lot so far this month working with Shaun Ames  through his registered investment company. Just do something that will make you money while you sleep, no matter how little. The pandemic has been a perfect eye-opener for us all to really see how life can be without your usual income stream. You can reach him on te legrm ( @Shaunamesfx ) ...."
4687,Why are u so negative?😭
4688,BTC crashing (a correction) but Tesla only buying.
4689,Yes yo momma incomming
4690,he just bought 1.5billion worth of btc
4691,I think he wants our btc
4692,"7:10 "" This is not an accurate chart of it"" ROFLAMO"
4693,"Utterly agree. Thank god you're here for newbies this cycle. We needed you in 2017 man.
Elon cares about space faring, period. He will use whatever overvalued movements to get there.. as he ethically should.

Tax though dude, remember to mention tax next time. 40% CGT for sub 12months in Australia. Ya betting on a crash and correct reentry in the face of that"
4694,"I'm a holy one, I hold while you sell on my $50 guru G :)"
4695,"Well haters, he's probably right."
4696,"They have 15 Billion in USD on their books already, you think they are worried about 1.5 Billion of Bitcoin?  Dude they bought bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a weakening USD DXY,,,"
4697,"They Will just buy the dips
They Don't think the way we do"
4698,"Sailor Musk won't sell that would incur short term capital gains taxes,,,"
4699,This guy is talking waffles lol what the heck is this tripe
4700,Why does he keep Making that wet shitfart noise with his mouth?
4701,"well at least one video thats realistic.. i am in this from 2017 and my nbr rule now is take initial and some profits before too late , waited for more than 2 years for .3x portfolio now *x .."
4702,"Elon Musk Tesla barely used 1%of the Capital to buy Bitcoin so they are more likely to spread FUD without actually selling and then DCA the dips,,,"
4703,Bitcoin will never hit a million. Wtf? lmao
4704,"I think you are very wrong, I am a strong believer in Bitcoin and don't think it will drop below $52,000. It is around $200 above at this minute and should be bought around this price point."
4705,"If your up 20 x,  sell it."
4706,Looks like Tesla is gonna hold their bitcoin bud
4707,FUD
4708,That's why Tesla has now started accepting Btc and will be keep it!!!
4709,"Guy gets involved for 12 months thinks he knows what he us talking about... the brightest minds in the world are in this space , they aren’t marketing, sales you tubers running a website flogging sales funnels for Facebook ads..."
4710,52000
4711,"""WRONG...!!"" Again....as ALWAYS~~~lol"
4712,Bet you feel awfully dumb right now
4713,"Stop the FUD. But great post. I do think like this myself. But I don't believe institutions going to sell. If retail do, they'll buy all of it. If they wanted they cud simultaneously dump when F2P dumping n crash the market. Also all the btc ETF wud be a joke."
4714,"Did this guy actually make money without his family? Just wondering, I like being surprised."
4715,You do not understand Tesla and it is no luxury and most people will not want gas in a crash. Electric is the future both ways.  As for the stock yeah it will crash lol
4716,Yes....Time to load more
4717,Lol there are so many investors in Europe buying several K Bitcoin. The price will pump up to 100k by end of this year. One of Europe’s biggest investors bought couple K BTC. It went main stream on the news.
4718,They didn't lose their Money though did they if they HODL they mad bank
4719,I'd never ever buy BTC when it's just had a parabolic fast pump. People encouraging others to buy now probably bought it under $10K at least. Probably a lot less. They need noob buyers to keep the price up whilst simultaneously off-loading theirs. Whales easily manipulate it. BTC tech is hugely gas guzzling & woefully inadequate. 5-12 transactions a second globally max. Longer term I can see a new competitor taking the crown.
4720,"I agree with you, despite I am bullish, taking the safer pessimistic approach is better. We might not get the too, but atleast we made good gains and not get wrecked"
4721,Wish I saw this video when it dropped. Someone who's willing to speak the unpopular narrative is what we need to hear. Are we talking about what is happening right now though or are we talking down the road.
4722,"What was the point of this video? You say sell TSLA then contradict yourself literally in the next sentence. Also evaluating Tesla as just a luxury car company is miss-information overvalued or not.
Bitcoin is a 5% or less portion of most people’s portfolio, it’s not something that would be horrible if it crashed.
This guy is trying to be on both sides of his viewers mindsets, he’s a yes man. Life’s to short for b*llsh*tters. Looool good things will happen to good people."
4723,this aged well
4724,You don’t lose anything if you just hold your shares and weather the storm.
4725,4:15 he explains what he is doing in the video.
4726,I totally agree with you and noone wanted to listen to me recently. People are greedy and all they want is fake news about how demanded btc is.
4727,Very nice video. Everyone hating is just retarded.
4728,"Man, you are not following the news, are ya!?"
4729,Fvck yes baby bear season
4730,Absolute clown!
4731,so far  bitcoin down and tesla down... he may be right lol
4732,Idiot.. Talking about crush and have no freaking idea why and how?
4733,elon will trade bitcoin to cdbc coin
4734,"Love seeing the TESLA fanboys in denial of what will absolutely happen. Of course Tesla and Musk will tell you that they aren't going to sell, what are you, stupid? They obviously won't tell you that they'll do a rugpull. That's how a pump and dump works.
BTC will pump to 300k and then will go down to 30k."
4735,"for everyone mad at the “clickbait”
8:52"
4736,100% true
4737,"Just subscribed, 
You must just got short aqueezed with 175x leverage"
4738,"Well, I like the way you think about financial market but we are getting sick of gas car. I don’t know about expensive Tesla car lol, I think it’s cheaper than paying for gas car with gas. This is one point I don’t agree with you"
4739,This didn’t age well
4740,Alex is literally only person talking truth. He’s right I was here 2017 when everyone said HODL. I was one of them. I   Done what the you tubers said to do and lost. Alex isn’t looking to be the last person out. Wish ppl was like this in 2017 because I got burned! Need more real youtubers not shilling
4741,"Oh I see big companies and banks will sell off BTC to counter losses in the falling dollar, tanking BTC, then buy it bk at the low low"
4742,how are people disliking this video? this is the most real talk ive heard anybody talk on crypto in a long time
4743,Great video.  At long last someone looking at Bitcoin with a bit of common sense. Here’s my thought for the day. Elton musk/ Tesla will sell Bitcoin  but will announce that they are going to buy a more echo- friendly crypto................. Watch this space. 😉🍾
4744,Fraud
4745,Wake up with zero dollars 💵 will be crazy
4746,Big crash 💥 crypto currency cash 💰 out 📉
4747,"Tesla just annouced today that will be accepting bitcoin as payment for theirs cars, you pretty much make me laugh with this title (Tesla is Selling)"
4748,"So your channel started going viral again... 
🔥🔥👏🏼"
4749,Nothin is happening! Next month will be beautiful. No crash ! No massive crash. This is not 2017. Please use SMART model with facts and data . No Picasso drawing ! peace .
4750,1.9 trillion dollars of stimulus money has been injected into the market crypto is going to explode
4751,Clickbait
4752,The difference now is all the money being printed all the inflation we are going to see. I don’t see people going back into cash.
4753,Always good to approach this space with a pragmatic view but the market didn't respond when Tesla bought it. If we see a prolonged correction it won't have a damn thing to do with opinions or perspectives.
4754,Is it happening today? This dip is looking pretty nasty today
4755,dont ever recommend this bs in my feed youtube
4756,I lasted until 9:54 then I had to stop.  Good luck man.
4757,Harmony one is consolidating
4758,"3x from previous ATH isn't enough imo, so before btc is 100k im not even thinking about a bearmarket"
4759,This looks toppy already. I watched this with precious metals in 2011-2012 and it's looking very similar. You have a new sub because the pump is nuts out there and I may be wrong but going from 1k-60k in a matter of 3 years is a hell of a bull run. Hope I'm wrong. What's keeping me in is the easy money policies and devaluation of the dollar that is happening at rapid pace. Already talking about Trillions more in infrastructure spending soon.
4760,Why are you trying so hard to convince others. Walk your path and shut your mouth Satan
4761,this didnt age well
4762,If you listen to this guy you are the chump!!!!! lmao
4763,I'm watching my BTC and ETH falling thru the floor to Hell as im watching this. You are correct.
4764,Damn you straight called it!
4765,What a waste of 20 minutes of my life...
4766,Hot token from Holochain is the future
4767,They just had 12 plus point hits like half hr ago. All crypto. I just bought the huge dip. Bjtcoin dropped from 57k to 52 in no time flat itself
4768,"Dude fix the fucking echo man, or don't make videos"
4769,They just had 12 plus point huts like half hr ago. All crypto
4770,Bitcoin was a amazing before Elon musk we don’t need no Elon musk 🧘💰💰🚀
4771,Ummmm... This guy...
4772,They didn’t lose if they didn’t sell
4773,"Been in Bitcoin since Sept 2017 and I gotta say, this video made me laugh and clap. 1000000% people buying now for long term looking to HODL are silly goose indeed XDDD"
4774,Just buy and hold
4775,"Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a  key macro level throughout the past few months. She believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for it’s near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this is why it’s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Prof Edith L. She is always one step ahead of other traders, she fully monitored my trades to avoid me making some mistakes and losing my money.

4776,Buy Nsav stock. It's a game a changer
4777,People do give a crap about the Earth.
4778,Maybe the Chinese people is taking profit and then buying it back again?
4779,Yessss let bitcoin crash back down to $1000 so I can buy a few
4780,"This guy gets it. Sorry moonbois, but this video rings very true."
4781,"Tesla "" you can buy a car in bitcoin "" clown ."
4782,😂 “Tesla selling” as they announce they will now accept bitcoin to buy a car.
4783,💎💪🏼🚀These diamond hands were built to HODL
4784,Grandparents boring conversation lol 🙄
4785,Elon Musk said in a tweet he isn’t converting Bitcoin to fiat bro
4786,"Alex, do you get paid by GOLD institutions ?????"
4787,"This guys logic is all wrong. 

He keeps saying everyone lost money in 2017, wrong !
Even if you bought at the peak of 18k in 2017, you can more than triple your money by selling today.  
But he got lot of people listen to this because of FUD headline."
4788,"This guy said. If u buy at $5. You have to sell at $10 before it goes to $5.  So, Someone always  loses  money. 
Infanct. Since the inception of bitcoin, doesn’t matter when you bought it (not counting last 2 weeks).  Every single person could have sold at higher price. Everyone would have made money. Everyone."
4789,yea and elon musk just said hes hodling and you can buy a tesla with bitcoin
4790,AKA: Keeping it real!
4791,"Tesla doesn't pay dividends.  They can't keep up with demand, selling every car they make.  They have years worth of orders on trucks and semis. They're building factories as fast as they can, making their own batteries, buying every battery they can get their hands on, and they're spending money as fast as they can on growth.  I really don't think you understand Tesla well enough to be able to make predictions concerning them, Alex."
4792,"I ALMOST shit post here BUT he's right. 
I have my plan.
Counterargument the sell off may be slow and deep."
4793,Love this video shows what a real trader looks for
4794,You make some good points but you didn’t mention a timeframe. It could pump for a couple more months then dump like you’re predicting. You got a timeframe?
4795,Every bitcoin investor right now is just smiling at the price of bitcoin as it held strong and indeed valuable enough to generating good return of investment. More persons are gonna become millionaires and we have bitcoin thanks for that
4796,Tesla announced you can buy Tesla with btc nice click bait this video did not age well
4797,"I might be biased because I won’t be happy if btc would dump but this is obviously click bate videos, especially (Tesla sells btc) This is extremely over extended click bate title if you are so hopelessly trying to get views it’s makes it  so obvious.think about what  % is 1,5 billion Tesla investment BTC if there totaal capital?  This question  pretty much answers the question"
4798,"Some kinda God sitting in you that's true what u said we are gambling without seeing our opponent.
When first I came to know mining of bitcoin in computer I laughed people thought computer has become mountain of gold and then mining of pi came in"
4799,Elon musk did for this world more than your comment . How u dare
4800,Show your buy/trade history you fake YouTube guru hahaha
4801,Dude this is funny. You think a recession will stop Tesla enthusiast from buying Tesla cars. They’re usually the ones with $ so the corona doesn’t affect them. This isn’t Toyota or Nissan’s.
4802,Ahhhh pumpkin. Its gonna be OK.
4803,Dude...  you are a straight clout chaser.  You aren’t a crypto guy..  anyone coming to Becker for Crypto knowledge is an idiot.  He is a spam artist
4804,Why do you think the plug will get pulled?
4805,Bitcoin hasn’t got any technology but Theta does
4806,People are so dumb!! this is hilarious
4807,Dude you're the master of covering every topic online. The problem is.. You're so spread thin that you're not actually helpful. Pushing ads for noob entrepreneur porn consisting of little to no technical details or professional insights.
4808,Feel stupid yet?
4809,"Bitcoin Trends is not even half of what 2018 was, it does nothing new and costs 3 times more. What can go wrong."
4810,He sure sold at 10K and now s mad
4811,i stopped watching the video when you said Cardano is your favorite coin
4812,High on weed😅😅
4813,"You are not telling all key elements. You are handsome and have a big mouth, but definitely you are rather junior"
4814,"Paused the video, ad block on, disliked, and letting you know that you are not loved. Have a bad day."
4815,this video is super woke.. some hard truths right there. 1 thing u missed though. Tether will buy every dip and print more USDT. I really have no idea when this implodes but it could take a really long time until ppl realize USDT is just some fake token and not an actual USD.
4816,As predicted  TA is life!
4817,Hahahah hardcore truth no o e speaks
4818,"So mate, the million btc question, when ARE you going to sell?"
4819,Clickbait as fuck dude thought you were different lol.....honestly your 10 ply
4820,How embarrassing. Elon tweeting about Tesla's expanded use of bitcoin. Showing Alex knows absolutely zip. All you fan boys fawning over a guy who simply films videos in an office he cleans 🤣
4821,"WOW, this aged well - why do I get sociopath vibes from this guy?? Anyone else??"
4822,"What this guy doesn’t understand is that people who’ve been through all the huge corrections and just held are in HUGE profit!!! HODL for life changing wealth! That simple! Timing top and bottom, you will get burned! Grey scale, PayPale, and Square are buying 900 BTC everyday! There’s only 900 BTC mined everyday! Do the math!!!! HODL!!!!"
4823,In fact elon said he wont sell even if it fall to 20K
4824,14:25  So well said:   I really don’t like these narratives..... 17:31 if these big boys sell.....blood bath
4825,Unsubscribe your ass
4826,"I love this fraudster. Tesla he said is going to tank and musk will sell their bitcoin to cover Tesla’s loss. 

Guess what, Tesla announced one can use bitcoin to buy Tesla and they are holding on to their bitcoins. Double whammy for you fraudster boy. You make me laugh. Keep it up. It’s entertaining. Lol"
4827,I really enjoy hearing you  upsetting the crypto evangelists
4828,Investing in Bitcoin and crypto currency is the  investment anyone can do this season because it has made a lot of people millionaires
4829,Current favourite channel....Bitcoin Tsunami don’t play!
4830,What do you all think about this guy's thinking 🤔
4831,Well is only been an hour and this didn't age well...lol. Read the latest Elon news. He is not selling...lol. The sky is not falling. FUD FUD FUD RUN FOR YOUR LIVES...LOL.
4832,This video aged pretty poorly.  Trash wanna-be.
4833,"If you think crypto is hypothetical that means 
you also think what visa provide is also hypothetical. Transactions. Transaction fees. That’s why it’s making money. Dummy. You’re invested in financial technology on the palm of your hand and don’t even know it 😂"
4834,That was 2017 lol 😂
4835,"Intro, grandparents, funny."
4836,"Btc is not going to crash. If you analyze the technical analysis and how much money is investing in the digital revolution, you can clearly see it might pull back after it gets to 78k but won't crash, this is what everyone was saying at 34k."
4837,"Haha this aged well 

More spews for views 

Pathetic"
4838,CLICKBAIT = GOODBYE!
4839,shut it
4840,wkwkwkwk
4841,"What a nonsense, saying Tesla will eventually sell their btc when en the big drop happens. When they sell, the others will buy their btc's, because the otc market is empty,"
4842,I’m going to put my chips in the dip
4843,Garbage
4844,this faker
4845,Can't wait to buy your bitcoin on the way down
4846,Ahhh I remember when I thought I could time the markets too. I was extremely paper rich as well 🥲
4847,"Using the word ""overvalued"" when talking about Bitcoin is kind of ridiculous.  My ask: if you use the term ""overvalued"" please describe what you are comparing to."
4848,"This is not an investor, this is a gambler"
4849,"This video is awesome~  I am not sure how long this parabolic run will continue without a major correction; besides, Tesla-Elon or Microstrategy-Saylor is too smart to hold all its/his bitcoin when the market crashes.  I would think that Elon and the institution will be ahead of the majority of retail investors.  Hypothetically speaking, if Tesla pulls out their bitcoin, how much would the Bitcoin market deep???????  Thanks for putting this content together~"
4850,Don't listen to others.... Bitcoin is your chance to be somebody....
4851,Greater fool theory
4852,Also Elon told he’s never going to sell BTC. Not a really good subject
4853,Why would these guys suddenly dump everything? They will sell over time it just doesn’t make sense for Tesla to just dump everything
4854,Disagree- we’re building an industry not a bubble
4855,"I believe the difference is I’ve never seen so much institutional interest in this so you can’t go by what’s happened in the past things are totally different now so only time will tell.
So I think it’s totally irrational to look at the last bull run. Where it was virtually all retail it’s done 180° turn."
4856,I dont get it. I dont see any universe where BTC isnt breaking 100k. Wheres it gonna go? Even if corps sell theyll be back. This is the future.
4857,"dude you gotta stop with this crypto nonsense, your losing all your credit"
4858,What are you thoughts on HEX? It's a ERC 20 on Ethereum. Is that an altcoin you're currently trading?
4859,Sell all your bitcoin so we can buy it. The stock market is gonna crash guys. You all need to sell. I want your cheap bitcoins so please sell.
4860,Lol this did not age well. I respect most of Becker's opinions unless its crypto related.
4861,shhh 🤫
4862,"all you gotta do is be locked and loaded ready to short, I do it every correction and usually make out well. crypto is like playing chess. it's high risk high reward, a lot of people are really uneducated and just jumping into it which isn't good. I'm currently developing a DeFi platform and capitalizing off this for the time being. low cap alts are where the money is. BTC and ETH aren't gonna make you much unless you lev trade, which is super gambling mode."
4863,Yeah but the bank crash all the time 😂 they bail them out. I rather invest in crypto.
4864,"The well off see's economy crisis as a garage sale, that's why investing right now will be the best decision"
4865,so go on and short ^^
4866,how can someone contradict himself in every second sentence xD you sir are a clown
4867,What comes up must go down do not let feelings influence your decisions. The space is going to be around for many generations this is the new Financial Market. I for one am not selling any of my crypto when the crash does happen. All my investments are a 5 year hold.
4868,This aged well
4869,hes proberly deleting this when the new ath hits soon^^
4870,"Something tells me this is just a tactic for people to sell their coins so institutions and whales can buy them up. My advice , do not sell!"
4871,"I don't trade, I invest in a crypto company that trades for us and returns profits on weekly basis for me and you can invest your capital and get weekly Returns of investment (ROI) without any extra fees attached"
4872,Talking Rubbish !

4875,"As much as I don’t want to believe, you make really good points"
4876,You speaking the truth. I've been skeptical for years and it's becoming more and more evident that it's being manipulated.
4877,@AlexBecker Was looking forward to see the video gaming coins that are dominating Bitcoin
4878,"This guy not making any sense


He says. He knows lot of people who lost 4 million in 2017

This bitcoins in 2017 worth 4 million. Would be worth more than 12 million today."
4879,I am confident Ill hit the top. Hit it last time at 16k-17k (Close enough). Also predicted the bottom.
4880,bro. this video didnt age well. LOL
4881,"Theres actually some good points here. Think about this : Tesla starts selling cars for BTC. Dumps BTC and takes huge profits ---> which then lowers BTC price --> Tesla gets more BTC for cars
Just some shower thoughts btw"
4882,So TESLA stilling selling right ? what a scrub 🤣
4883,How do you know Elon Musk is selling ?
4884,Wrong estimate :)
4885,Bitcoin is now among the top 8 most valuable global assets. This is the right time to invest.
4886,Well this title aged like fine milk.
4887,gobbledygook
4888,"Great ideas but it's not just the Tesla and a couple funds getting into it. Tesla just now started accepted bitcoin. Also, do you think the corporations behind this need the sale of a btc to not fail? Another thing, tesla isn't the only electric car maker and America is not the world. Crypto will become a world currency. Please do sell all of you bitcoin so I can buy. You may have made way more money than me but I don't believe you at all. It will crash, like everything but the corporations will hold while the sheep are selling and then the wolves will come snatch it up and they will control"
4889,Such a valuable video
4890,"50k is the bottom after this run. So either way, entering just under 50k and sleep well"
4891,"Damn straight!!!!!  Idiots be idiots.  I've been in the cryptoasset game since 2013, and lost too many times to not agree with this.  Crypto will always do something different than what the herd thinks."
4892,If you’re unironically subscribed to this guy then NGMI
4893,Tesla just announced today that they not even gonna sell the Bitcoin which they will receive as payments for their cars lol
4894,Anyone really surprised that this larper got it terribly wrong?
4895,The crash is coming but it is the fiat dollar that’s going down. Bitcoin to the moon 🚀🌙💰
4896,Stupid video
4897,This is just speculative FUD
4898,"If you bought in early enough you never took a loss. The lows are higher. “When in doubt zoom out” if you buy off emotion and don’t believe in the tech, you deserve to lose money. The dollar is dead."
4899,Just bad timing bro
4900,True tesla is selling fiat for bitcoin
4901,This video didn’t age well
4902,B.S
4903,This aged well in 24 hours.
4904,Awesome analysis... agree 100% ... bitboy called you out man ... busting ur balls man
4905,What are you talking about fool....Ypure such a propped up deep state operative its hilarious...All you do is push Agenda 21 Narrative....
4906,"Just seem to me this guy is only thinking about Bitcoin like gold, it isn't just a elemental entity, its a technology, a tech at its infancy to be precise, that people wouldn't up and leave it the moment they make a few buck on it. If Apple was growing the way Bitcoin is in value, I suspect he wouldn't have this mindset about it."
4907,Aged too quickly lol
4908,this is nonesense. Visa and mastercard will soon be offering bitcoin rewards on each and every purchase. Combine this with excessive money printing. Good luck with your crash fantasy buddy
4909,The eco sound of the room sucks
4910,Thats what I needed to hear! Thank you!
4911,"Wow, this video didn't age well, did it? What an asshole."
4912,I used to think this guy was legit. His views on crypto is making me think he is a fraud.
4913,Haha..
4914,FRAUD
4915,Uh I’m still waiting..... where’s the crash? U obv don’t know shit
4916,Yet he still got 120k views .. and a decent check off this bullshit video
4917,Is this guy working for the SEC ??
4918,This channel only fear mongers. Joke
4919,NONSENSE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4920,mmm....
4921,"Not only is Tesla accepting bitcoin, but they are keeping it as bitcoin as a store of value rather than converting it to fiat"
4922,(Tesla Selling their cars for Bitcoin! - lol)
4923,Who is this guy???
4924,4:54 This guy thinks you get dividence if you own stock in a company xD
4925,Theyve been saying this since BTC was at $200
4926,Come out now please. Sell your coins now please. Some will bite this and sell their BTC and he will profit with your sold BTC. lol
4927,NO
4928,Theta Is hype. It is going to crash the hardest sadly
4929,Nothing sells a video better than fear.
4930,You full of crap!
4931,"Hope you see, and can respond bro, but do you think April is setting up to be an altcoin season?"
4932,Elon strikes me like a person who gives a shit about investors. But what do I know ;) thnx for interesting point of view.
4933,"I understand your perpective. But there is simply more to it. For example bitcoin is proven now after al these years that its profiteble after holding for minimum 3 years. There is your answer. 

Mayb you should listen to people like micheal saylor who has a full understanding about storing whealt for the comming 10+ years

They are not in it for the short term profit. These institutions starting to understand the value of bitcoin in the long term.

If you want to make money in the short term then you totaly right. But the mindset if shifting espescially with the dollar losing it’s value"
4934,"buy Audius now, its undervalued, thank me later."
4935,"Well, as of today , you can now purchase a Tesla with Bitcoins. Payment is to be processed directly thru Bitcoin node and Elon is saying it will not be turned back to Fiat...remain as Bitcoin."
4936,"Elon pumps bitcoin for his own profits, then dumps on everyone"
4937,"While everything you say is right theoretically, I don‘t see people like Michael Saylor and Tesla pulling out unless they believe that Bitcoin is done forever. Tesla is a company looking into the future, not looking into the next couple months. Unless they believe that Bitcoin is a fail they will not simply pull out from one day to the other.
Maybe Michael Saylor is just playing a show to everyone but as of now this guy believes Bitcoin is going to a 10-100 trillion market cap, why should he pull out during this bullrun already?"
4938,BtC winter is coming ❄❄❄❄
4939,"I just report titles like this, click bait"
4940,Why do you have to pull out at all ?  you dont look to be retirement age you got another 10+ years there bub dont be so short sighted. The most successful investors are ALL those who invested and forgot.
4941,"🤣😂🤣 ever market has  a massive crash 💥 the stock market,gold,silver, bonds etc. a crash 💥 is not the case is crypto going to zero is the question"
4942,I don’t know who this person is.  Showed up on my feed but I will say this.  Have a plan stick to it I have my selling price to sell SOME of my crypto.  If it hits it great if it doesn’t oh well I’ll wait.  If you held from 2017 till now here’s a little secret your AHEAD! So the friends he mentioned who had 4 mill at the top of 2017 if he held he has close to 12m now yes it took a while but better late then never.  Also yea Tesla is selling ... first and last video I watch.
4943,Please remove your channel. You are spreading false information.
4944,There not selling you can now buy tesla with BTC and they won't covert the payments into fiat currency. 🙋‍♂️
4945,"Sorry bro this was a badly timed video, Elon has just trolled you!"
4946,The greatest depression combined with cyber attacks taking down the grid are coming courtesy of klaus Schwab and Co. I've sold crypto and bought more silver.
4947,"One of the best measures of coins that are perfect for long-term investments is the daily trading volumes. The higher the daily trading volume, the more suitable an asset is for long-term investments."
4948,Tesla accepts bitcoin to buy a car. Looks more like Tesla starts piling up bitcoin.
4949,Still think this today?
4950,Tesla just announced that they’re accepting Btc for sales
4951,"The truth is like poetry...... And everybody hates poetry...
: Some dead dude"
4952,"Alex, you need to look into accounting for Goodwill and impairment losses.  There is something people aren't seeing here..."
4953,Every idiot thinks they are an expert ffs it’s shameful tbh
4954,I hope it so bad... i wanna do  some big bitcoin shopping
4955,Your shit isn't sticking bro. Keep throwing. Lol
4956,Wrong!
4957,4 million -> 350k must feel like the worst kind of pains 😂
4958,"I made huge profit on my investment since I started trading with Mrs Stephanie, her trading strategies are top notch."
4959,Thank you Alex for adding some much needed logical thinking and common sense to help disillusion this bull run.
4960,"Alex ""I bought bitcoin 1 year ago, I'm an expert now"" Becker."
4961,Tesla just announced that they will accept Bitcoin as payment for cars and specified that they will not convert it to fiat. This video didn’t aged well this guy is spreading FUD maybe becuase he cares about people and doesn’t want to see them lose everything but you can’t make up some news.
4962,alex what are going to do with all your money? looks you are never happy man
4963,"I saw this video as far as ""I'm not clickbaiting... but I'm not an expert on crypto..."" yeah ok homey, delete your clickbait. Lemme guess, you're not holding?"
4964,stock market crashes every 60-second that's way you have up and down charts
4965,"After the Elon tweet where he says Tesla is now accepting bitcoin for payment, and it will not have to be converted to fiat. Your whole little video is rendered irrelevant you should delete it."
4966,You should of stress this info on the video you made 7 months ago where you almost urge people to buy bitcoin. Js
4967,Lol yeah yeah there selling
4968,"The best proven strategy to make money in crypto is just never selling. Not when it goes up, not when it goes down. Selling the top, buying the dip, all of that is just people who think they can outsmart whales. You cannot outsmart whales except for just riding their waves with them and hodling on, maybe buying some more if you have spare cash left during a dip. Just don't sell until you really need the cash. Bitcoin might just randomly go to 500k this time. It might stop here. It might go back to 3k. But eventually  it will go back up."
4969,"Clickbait videos starting off with ""This is not clickbait"" 🙈"
4970,"Looks like Telsa ready to accept bitcoin and ready to accumulate more.... I believe the stock market and crypto is kind of related, but question is if the stock market is really going to crash or take dips. They didn't built the market to crash it what I mean is quantitive easing. Lol ....Based on past videos u been negative on bitcoin and like Alts which is fine."
4971,"The truth is bitter to lots of people, but sweet to me. 🤩"
4972,"This video didn't age well, like at all :D"
4973,I give you guys good advice don’t put all your eggs in one basket invest just a little bit and whatever happens  don’t get greedy because you don’t want to lose everything you have💪💰💪
4974,Elon Musk responded my friend.
4975,How do you have so many subscribers spewing such trash?
4976,"Musk has stated you can purchase a Tesla with Bitcoin, which is hardly an expression of doubt."
4977,Respect your grandparents. Maybe you're the boring one.
4978,Dude tesla doesn't pay dividends
4979,This didn't age well!
4980,Bitcoin will probably break 100k before even thinking about going into a bear market.
4981,Talking bout things you don't understand that's why you can't define them man- ETH has a huge usecase - so as altcoin season starts only when btc tops out not at the same time all markets crash :)
4982,"Title is a bit misleading, Tesla isn't selling"
4983,How long do we have to get out? Just curious
4984,So is it sensible for me to sell all of my bitcoin now then?
4985,"Hahahaha I laughed so hard when you were waving like ""Its cool its cool, we wanna have everybody to stay on top we hold it for the market we believe in BTC"" :D Thank god one more person out there who thinks like me. It would be just ultra naiva to believe all those big companies stay in when BTC crashes down. Appreciated your video and your smooth direct way very much, thanks mate, left you a sub! :)"
4986,Why should we listen to someone who made loses in crypto?
4987,But it may happen
4988,"I like your perspective 👍
Very lateral however Tesla won’t sell. He’ll use the BTC as collateral so he won’t have to sell😉🙏"
4989,Michael Saylor isn’t selling. Ever!!
4990,What I needed to hear even though I knew. Well said.
4991,You are just dumb
4992,Not quite true in 2017 most people had until May 2018 to get out there were a couple of selling bounces to get out on
4993,It needs to crash into something better though. Fiat? Maybe when Borders open
4994,So unfortunate for someone not to look forward to meet his parents. It's a reflection of your character and because you had a bad experience the world is a morbid place or you had bad experience with women and blame all women.
4995,Wuhahah fake news tesla sell btc
4996,this video is not relevant anymore. You can delete it sir
4997,He will do anything to get views!
4998,"shutup, Tesla aint selling shit"
4999,"So, I guess Tesla isn't selling..."
5000,"I don't think the top of Bitcoin was reached yet in this bull market. There wasn't great velocity, but a healthy growing instead. I guess we we'll see who was right."
5001,Dude got in early. Kudos. Does not make him an authority on anything. House money?
5002,Cut this youtube clickbait bullshit
5003,"Tesla isn’t selling in fact they just announced today that they are accepting Bitcoin and they won’t be converting it into fiat currency, they will keep their bitcoin as is . Even if there is a correction that’s healthy overall and second this should be a long term hold not a quick day trade . People always scream the end of Bitcoin and it’s not happening the fundamentals of crypto is too solid ."
5004,What this guy doesn't understand is bitcoin isn't an instrument for investment. It's to hedge against inflation and have sovereignty over your own finances. He brings up a good point but supply and demand wise. There's more money sitting on the sidelines convinced to go in then there is of people that are in ready to pull the trigger to sell..
5005,Of special contrarian fundamental  note; Wall Street is bullish on BTC now (2017 level ) and that tells me we can get a deeper correction to the 21 weekly ema.  We haven’t touched it since The fall of 2020.  It’s overdue. Hold onto your shorts... and protect your longs
5006,finally some honesty no hype news
5007,You can now buy Tesla using BTC
5008,Thoughts on Polkadot and KSM Alex?
5009,"I am thinking June top. ~$225,000."
5010,Lmao delete this 😁
5011,that didn't age well
5012,"Good analysis, appreciate the honest outlook 👏👍"
5013,"Good vid for sure, but your tesla thought experiment doesn’t really make sense imo. If the stock market tanks, BTC will crash as well. They’re highly correlated."
5014,Wrong
5015,"Hahahaha this is not crash, elon behind stay strong bitcoin !! Tesla payed with bitcoin 


HOLD IT FRIENDS!💪🚀💸"
5016,What do u hve to say now? @elonmusk tweet!!
5017,What a fucking CLICKBAIT title...
5018,Mrs Jessica   is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy
5019,I had the same feeling. Just watch the monthly chart. A six month exponential pump never happened in bitcoin history. It will retrace fiercely and soon. So I took profits. Now question: I put limit orders at about 60-70% retracement to buy the dip (according to 2013 cycle). What do you think about it? A double top cycle like 2013 or end of the cycle before summer?
5020,Tesla short seller LOL goodluck
5021,Are you sure you are playing with the house’s money because you seem like you are losing your lunch😂 You were super wrong here bud!
5022,"Allways wise to consider all options, and listen to other opinions. Any way this goes, risk management is important... Find you limits, and stay safe."
5023,"Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today."
5024,Saving your money and investing it into stock market will be the wisest thing to do to ensure success
5025,"Meanwhile

Elon Musk:  Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.

Alex, you still have time to delete the video."
5026,The stock market crashes and institutions sell bitcoin to offset their losses. Brilliant! I honestly didn't even think about this point. I appreciate tip.
5027,"Engels

every crypto currency is manipulated with computers !!! If you look at a chart, it doesn't matter which literally all of them you will find a center point on the 7 day chart and sometimes on the month chart !!! If you cut the chart in half at this point and then flip and stretch the rising portion you will see that it is identical to the falling portion !!! this is how they read the future (with AI.). PS. Don't use this info as advice because all you are doing is stealing from ignorant often poor people. good luck."
5028,Tesla just announced they taking btc payments. They Definitely not selling anytime soon.
5029,Elon Musk: Wrong
5030,"Check out Safepal $SFP because its new a binance project and its only hardware wallet that you can connect with binance wallet and trade safely, decent idea actually lol"
5031,I can’t imagine life without hackersmiftss_ on !G they’re legitimate
5032,I can’t imagine life without hackersmiftss_ on !G they’re legitimate
5033,Cellframe $CELL 🔥🚀
5034,I don't think so ! :)
5035,"This guy is keeping it real nothing is guaranteed. I've seen all these videos saying Eth  to the Moon Bitcoin to 500,000.
$100 cardano. Right, lol. 
So are we on the edge of a cliff or at another Bull run.?
For now I'm betting on the alt coins with the best real world utility."
5036,"Good story, seems like tesla has more trust in bitcoin like you..."
5037,Check back in two weeks if this video is still up 🧑‍💻
5038,I hope there is. Imma buy the shit
5039,"You better drop that shit of a video, considering tesla is now accepting bitcoin as a payment"
5040,Well said. Subbed
5041,"BRACE YOURSELF.....

CAN.T READY FOR THAT MASSIVE DIP!!"
5042,Buy a tesla with real currency aka bitcoin fiat is shit
5043,"I invest $1 billion in a crypto, I change the market value and everyone makes money. I sell $1 billion along with my profit I still make money and everyone else loses."
5044,Pretty sure you should stop putting so much powder up your nose.
5045,"Am here at 1:30am waiting for your video saying I apologize, I was wrong!"
5046,I swear 99% of crypto youtubers are CLUELESS
5047,Thanks man. Refreshing opinion.
5048,"Tesla just announced they will be accepting bitcoin for purchasing their cars. They will only add btc, not sell."
5049,Telsa just tweeted that they won't be selling their bitcoin.
5050,"Honestly folks, clickbaity videos like this are the reason why you will lose money in crypto. They pump out any content they can so they get more views and likes etc, which in turn provides them with added income. Meanwhile, us viewers are being influenced by THEIR ideas and making decisions based on emotion rather than doing due diligence and researching ourselves. I lost money last weekend because of this and have therefore unsubscribed from all channels in this niche. All except one, Coin Bureau. He used NO advertisements and has over half a million loyal subscribers. Furthermore, his content is incredibly well researched and is 100% objective."
5051,Talk about over extended. Waiting for the huge fall!!! Remember it does not move like stock
5052,Nobody ever lost a dollar taking profit
5053,thought provoking
5054,"This is the hard reality, no holds barred. Thanks for the heads up."
5055,I agree a storm is brewing
5056,"So you said you think BTC will be worth 1million in 10 years. 
Now it is worth 56k. 
So you are predicting an average yearly (compounded) growth of 33%/year.
Aaaaand you think BTC it's overvalued? 

Dude you are just trying to time the market. Anybody believing in an average growth of 33%/year should not sell."
5057,"Have you seen Musk latest Tweet?
“Tesla is using only internal & open source software & operates Bitcoin nodes directly.
Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency” 
He is not planning to sell!"
5058,"You and many other value their wealth in fiat money, and that's ok. 
You Boomers should definitely sell, digital revolution isn't meant for you in the first place."
5059,"Per today's news, WRONG again"
5060,"Lmao.... sell your shit, I'll buy yours no worries.. I'm Praying for people to sell..."
5061,This aged like milk 😂
5062,"So Tesla owns 0.12% of the Bitcoin's market cap, and will create a historic crash if they pull the plug?"
5063,Tesla just announced they're enabling BTC payments and will not convert to Fiat upon sale. Cheers
5064,Elon just said he's now accepting BTC and will keep it in BTC.
5065,"Remember, you only loose money when you sell."
5066,'Tesla selling' - Day later Elon announces that you can buy Tesla's with BTC. Sure bro
5067,"Why are you deleting comments bro? xD

Again, you just contradicted yourself in this video. You're saying ""I believe in bitcoin's future"" but you're saying that uhm... it won't go higher anymore? What? 

If you do believe in crypto's future, you know that it can go higher than this especially right now that institutions are coming in. You sound like you got FUD and don't wanna lose 1000% gains. Well, you do you bro. 

You love bitcoin sure, but to me you sound like one of those pump and dump guys you described. The ones who doesn't care about the future and just the gains. :)"
5068,Brilliant!
5069,I just think the big dogs will eventually make it crash to show its instability  and offfer there stable alternative
5070,You are So WRONG
5071,Trading crypto has become a lucrative way of making money
5072,It's actually opposite. Tesla now allowing People to buy with Bitcoins.
5073,"LMAO, why delete my comment?"
5074,Elon just announced Tesla will accept Bitcoin today 1am
5075,"Tesla is using only internal & open source software & operates Bitcoin nodes directly.

Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.

Signed Elon Musk"
5076,there's a nice Reverb on your voice. why dont you wear a watch anymore? :)
5077,Musk just announced that Bitcoin payments will be accepted for tesla and it will be retained as BTC. If true then the title of this video automatically does not age well.
5078,"Remember every coins you sell, going to connect smart money, by smart whales. (Michael Saylor, etc.."
5079,This is FUD only xd
5080,"JFK's father spotted the 1929 stockmarket crash when he heard shoe shine boys giving stock advice. Today we have Robin Hood, twitter, reddit and YouTube."
5081,Tesla is now accepting BTC as payment...........
5082,"“I believe in bitcoin’s future”

If you do(which I doubt you do, you’re clearly one of the pump and dump guys), why sell now? Won’t it reach 200-300-500k for the next 3-4 years?"
5083,they are selling around 60k
5084,Buy Harmony quick its🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
5085,Tesla isnt luxurious
5086,"“This isn’t clickbait”
No
No it is"
5087,Bitcoin is the feature investing in it now is the wesest thing to do now especially the current rise
5088,There's a higher chance of the dollar crashing than bitcoin...
5089,"Definitely clickbait 😉.   An honest title would have been, “How to Hedge against Likely Whale BTC Sell-Off”.    But, hey you’re in a that foxhole.   I do appreciate the message."
5090,Why would the big guys sell when they could just collateralize their BTC on loan if they need cash short term?
5091,"How they lost, if the hold ? They can not lost it..."
5092,"40% is must, because if it do not drops nobody do buy it..It is a kind of wave ...like a pyramid sheme"
5093,Thanks for bringing me back to reality
5094,"Alex: ""the title Isn't clickbait""

Clickbaits. 

Unsubscribed."
5095,Until Covid 19 pass away in the minds of people who created then Crypto will fall . The time didn’t come yet .Countries aren’t ready yet.!But it probably fall tomorrow !
5096,"Idk.. im in a hurry to ditch gas vehicles. I can make eletricity fairly easily.. making gasoline is.. uhh hard? Even if the grid failed i can get eletric fast while gas pumps are down? Between uber black. Turo. Automated taxi income. Why own anything else? Btc is down bc of delays in stimulus. All the whales put in to bait the little ppl. Its gonna be a feast for them when covid is ""gone"" and the stim payments finally hit all around. Ppp. Eidl. Etc. But why would they. They can make more cash just the same. Watch the payment gateway progress. Thats the true tell. When u can buy juul with btc at a country gas station its ready. It doesnt matter what the price of btc is. Only how much you have. USD Cash Will Be Dead. 1 million cash down to 100k this year will still be 1 billion tomorrow? Just my thoughts. I feel safer having btc at this price then trying to flip for pocket change. Remember that 1 time you bought a bag of over priced pot only to have better pot at a cheaper price today? No."
5097,"Alex, you are right. That is exactly what is going to happen. I have a question for you: In case I don't want to get my money in cash, but keep in a stable coin (if there is any in a crash scenario) what would be the coin? I understand USDT is not reliable and TUSD it is a good one, but I am not sure during the Big Crypto crash that will happen."
5098,100% correct mate ✅
5099,The world would be better place of there 's were more people like HACKERSJOI on INSTA I will never forget you sir
5100,Great. Plenty of buying opportunities.
5101,"Uh, AMZN and TSLA don't pay dividends. Methinks someone doesn't know what she's talking about."
5102,Thanks for the reality check Bro!!!
5103,The world would be better place of there 's were more people like HACKERSJOI on INSTA I will never forget you sir
5104,Made heavy bank with many coins especially cardano at 0.06 cents ! This video has bought me back to reality! Yes I’ve made bank but I also want to keep it! Thanks for keeping me in reality bro!

5107,Theta has value tho I think theta is the best coin in the world lol
5108,I prefer outside the box thinking... subscribed
5109,when did tesla say there selling ?
5110,"Why do people who have Bitcoin treat it like a cult? Who cares, it's nothing more than a different way to make money, you don't have to act married to it."
5111,This guys mindstate is REKT = FUD = 2010-2020 thinking. Bye.
5112,"Bitcoin's gonna crash, better pull out fast!"
5113,Your video hurts my eyes
5114,He trying to get your bitcoin for cheap 😂😂😂
5115,bring it on baby! I am sitting on cash waiting to buy in.
5116,"Although you are correct in having a pessimistic view for a crash, it will come... we just have to expect what wont be expected. The whales influence the corrections so they can accumulate more. The entire market follows the price of bitcoin, alts will rise and fall at a higher rate. I think we'll see a variant of the 2013 and 2017 combined. That would be 3 peaks, the 3rd one being the bulltrap of the supercycle in nov/dec. One around now, one in the fall, and one at the end of the year... they can't resist the last drip from the barrel before the tax cutoff. Everyone that thought they called the Sept/October peak will FOMO into a late december trap. No matter how hard the crash is, I don't think we'll ever go below $20k again. Anything under $30k throughout the summer will be a bargain, anything under $50k after the big crash will be a good bargain as well."
5117,Yeah having a pessimistic attitude is NOT ideal at all. You are going to miss out big time on massive gains...
5118,"""You silly goose"" that was funny, got a thumbs up"
5119,"Honestly this is dumb, you say that you think it will go to million dollars in 20 -30 yes and your talking about closing at 75k after it’s already went to 100k

There is options contracts where you can sell calls against your btc and make premium to just keep it with out selling."
5120,"Dude, ""these institutions""  only have 1% or less in Bitcoin. They are not gonna sell that to bail themselves out. That is the LEAST of their problems. The amount of money those funds have invested can't even move the needle."
5121,This dude is wrong all the time
5122,Honestly very solid advice
5123,"Stop. Wait. What makes you think that Tesla would do anything with the $5 Billion in Bitcoin?  5 billion is NOTHING bro. The Tesla market cap is 650 billion. 5 billion won't be a drop in the bucket. Tesla/Elon WILL NEVER use that 5 billion to ""prevent shareholder loses""    No..just no."
5124,You're my new hero man. This is the perspective I actually wanted. We're in for the money. Screw everything else. Moral of the story: nobody is smart enough to catch the top
5125,Tesla is a 680B market cap Co.  1.5B can help ease the lost in car sale?  Please explain. thx
5126,"You speak truth on SOME things. 
-Just sold 95% of my ADA earlier today
-Crypto is WAY over hyped and WAY overvalued as you pointed out
-Crypto has FAILED in virtually ALL missions that it set out to accomplish

Whatever happened to low fees?
Whatever happened to being able to pay for stuff IRL with crypto?
Whatever happened to all those debit cards you were supposed to be able to pay with crypto? 9 out of 10 of them don't exist anymore.
Whatever happened to anonymity? 
Whatever happened to the core tenets of crypto? 

The entire space, the entire industry (for the most part) is complete and utter trash and has failed miserably. There are a FEW good projects. And by a few I literally mean a few, as in 3ish. ETH is trash and always has been. BTC is trash and always has been. Same with 6,000 others. I'm thankful I squeezed out six figures.

In it's current iteration the crypto industry is absolutely worthless to 99.9% of the real world, and is ONLY valuable as a means to trade speculative ""assets"" and take dumb people's money. 

With all of this said I hold BTC, ETH, and ADA. But ONLY because I want to take dumb peoples money. Not because it's going to change the world. It'll change MY WORLD though. The market is disgustingly over inflated and WILL see an 85% correction. I hope I'm wrong, and I hope BTC goes to 200K, I hope ETH goes to 10K, and I hope ADA goes to $10. But I don't believe that will happen. 

Take your profits before someone else does. Best of luck to all."

I totally agree with you."
5135,"If all you folks are into crypto to have it increase in value and then convert it back into USD, you have lost the point of crypto. This is about decentralized finance, decentralized voting,  property ownership,  identification,  governance... this is about a new way of life,  and the end goal is to actually get rid of centralized fiat currency,  get rid of centralized governance systems,  voting systems,  and make it a way of life.  This is the only thing that is certain in the next 50 years."

5137,"I would agree that most cryptos will fail...  but a handful will succeed, and by that I mean,  they will remain in the world for decades to come and most importantly they will be used. The ACTUAL USAGE of any crypto is what will determine its worth. Do you think Google would be anything if people weren't USING it millions of times per second?

Invest a bit for fun short term, but invest in what you believe in long term."

dont assume every institutional buyer is as new to crypto as u"
5147,"Dude, You don't get it!!!! All you've said relates to the side show. You simply don't grasp the technology. This is  not like the dot com boom etc. There is a profound  technological shift here. Bitcoin has been tested for over 10 years. Any damage  to the technology  will be a damage to major, worldwide  systems."
5148,shut up fool you don't what you are talking about!!Stick to the Fake Guru business bro. Bitcoin and Crypto's are here to stay its just getting started actually. FUD
5149,F...ing Bears!
5150,Bitcoin is globally used digital currency. It will be the next monetary trading after the dollars crashes.
5151,"What will make Tesla sell? I'd say if silver goes up much higher Tesla will have to buy a lot of silver or lose shitloads of it, maybe something that could drive their bitcoin dump, silver is a huge resource for their cars and bitcoin does them nothing except hedge the dollar in short term"
5152,"As he says, Elon is a futurist. It now goes against his image to not be invested in the future of money, or digital gold. Also, selling bitcoin would be seen as weakness and uncertainty. The value of Tesla shares hinges on the impression that Elon knows exactly what he intends to do in the future. Clearly, Elon listens to the logic of Saylor and is holding bitcoin long-term as a hedge against being too cash reliant, and the broader Fiat system. Generally speaking, for tech revolutionaries, it is now more embarrassing to not be in bitcoin because both dramatic corrections and huge gains are equally expected. However, the last decade teaches us that the gains have always beaten the corrections, so there is no long-term downside to Bitcoin anymore for publicly visible investors. If it crashes, the investors will just shrug and say, ""I'm patient"". That is why Saylor is so fearless with his money and his company. That is why Elon is now in. As Saylor asserts, the risk-reward ratio is now optimal.

I would also guess that Elon is waiting to see who is victorious or dominant among Eth, Dot and Ada before getting in deeper with highly useful Altcoins (not just Doge). 

I would guess that the major stock market correction that comes at the end of the US money printing will be harder on Altcoins than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is seeing institutional ""diamond hands"" investing and will only drop by 30-40%, but altcoins will drop by 80%. I can't wait for the crash to buy into various projects very cheap. It will also be interesting to see how much money NYDIG is able to convert into Bitcoin by the middle of the year.

Thanks for the content Alex, I appreciate your channel for sharing your in depth thinking."

5179,If Michaes Saylor is right and there wont be a huge bear market then I think there won’t also be a parabolic rise because every parabolic rise is followed by a huge correction.

5181,"Honestly.... good. BTC needs to crash so we can go higher, while alt coins need to gain more momentum and dominance in the market."
5182,Maybe he’s right and institutions don’t give a shit about bitcoin but where his wrong is that the institutions and corporations need bitcoin because they hold a bunch of cash and cash is losing value FAST!!
5183,"That would be stupid, there is less bitcoins than millionaires. 
So it is stupid to sell a bitcoin less than 200000$ in this cycle"
5184,I think everyone will profit more by adopting Bitcoin instead of selling it.
5185,"Not sure who this video is aimed at but anyone who has been in crypto more than 3 years already knows this... Experienced crypto Holders are not the morons everyone thinks.   The crypto space is squeezing out the Wall Street middle man. The young generation will have no need for money managers taking a commission so it won't happen overnight but crypto is pure to peer to peer, plain and simple... Banks and institutions will have no choice but to buy as they are trying to stay relevant period of course none of this will show up for a decade or so but the landscape will be a lot different for banks and Wall Street in the future in my opinion... You don't need a bank if you have a Dex platform"
5186,Alex you don't understand it nor the current narrative...the greater fool? When you sell Bitcoin for fiat you are backtracking...
5187,FUD clickbait
5188,Where is your evidence?
5189,So it sounds like you are saying that when stocks tank they will sell all their bitcoin. So doesn't that mean crypto will be the last fall?
5190,We need more of these kind of videos. The more uncertainty that spreads the sooner I can buy a Graphics card at retail and upgrade my PC. Hopefully more  videos with this perspective will continue to come out.
5191,Tesla and the boys are probably in agreement on when to sell
5192,People who can afford a Tesla wont be bothered by the economy. I might hurt a little. But not really. Google it see if bently sales were affected by the economic collapse of 2009. Nah man. But I do like ur channel you make me think.
5193,Selling early doesn´t mean you lose!
5194,USD is trash!!!   Why sell....what do you do with with USD paper Fiat.....wipe your ass?
5195,"Your FULL of Sh!t.

If you had millions in 2017 in Bitcoin....it peaked at  20k....now it's 60k....so HOW did they lose all their money????  They 3x'd their money?

You ONLY lose when you sell!!!"
5196,"I'm sorry, but I think you're mistaken on a few points. Your video started off good and I was liking the direction, but I simply disagree with you. First of all, the government is intensely watching the institutions right now in fear of certain big dogs planning some sort of market sell off or short. Crypto has no regulations, this can be done. Second of all, Tesla bought BTC most likely because it's a non-liquid asset which increases or decreases company value, thus inflating their stock price for SEC filings. When they sell of or not remains to be seen. Third point - for every 1 investor in BTC or another crypto, there's 50 other investors watching with a raised eyebrow calling this a tulip. The institutions know very well there's nothing justifying a 60k price and are going to take advantage of this. They are no stupid. They know what you retail investors are thinking, too. Everyone does. You all think it's going to go parabolic blah blah blah with no correction and come time September... I think a lot of the investment institutions like Goldman Sachs are going to wait for it to go to 65k or so, make a solid 5-20% on their investment, sell out, and say ""buh bye"" while you see the price plummet. Institutions don't roll dice like retail investors. They have PLENTY of money and aren't going to risk 5% of their portfolio as an institution to make a 200% return in a 6 month bull run. They're more calculated than that. And the institutions have enough reputation and pull in the industry to burst the bubble and do this if they want. What makes you think they wont prematurely? What makes you think everyone is waiting for massive returns here?

And BTC is *NOT* a hedge against deflation. Most investors do not think that. Gold isn't even moving up right now."
5197,Good thing this is YOUR opinion.  If you don't understand the why these Institutions are putting some of their portfolio in BTC then I dont have the time to explian it.
5198,I appreciate your perspective.

5204,"Thanks for keeping your followers on the loop! Keep it us updated on your thoughts, it's much appreciated. I think that whoever disliked this video doesn't see the magnitude of what Alex is talking about. This is not about weak/diamond hands guys, it's much bigger than that"
5205,"Lmao how do you even have 500k subs...
You talk about ""narrative"" but you don't understand btc is no longer a pump and dump asset. It is becoming a store of value such as gold and institutions don't sell gold (even though they don't profit from it) and they won't sell BTC because it's a deflationary asset.

I doubt a supercycle will come as soon as we thing because most retail investors will end up selling.

You're saying these coins are worth nothing except cryptos in a whole in the next 20 years will be worth minimum 50% of global currency in a way shape or form.

Stop spreading FUD and start making videos about a new topic."
5206,"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull, but BTCis going nuclear. A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.

5280,A lot of IFs here. He sounds like he regrets selling his bags
5281,Appreciate the advice
5282,"hello I'm new to Bitcoin trade and I've been making few loses, but recently I saw a lot of people earning from it.  can someone please  give me a new strategy or at least tell me what I'm doing wrong?"
5283,This guy is clueless
5284,Nice video but I just watched 7 ads for 20 min. Cmon man
5285,Traders stay poor
5286,I think you’re right on “this time is different” however I wouldn’t say new institutions “don’t care” I think they do they just never took time to understand it and btc is very hard to grasp imo.
5287,"If the very limited BNB coin can go from $12.00 to $261.00 in 12 months, what will THETA with more utility than any other coin on the market be capable of achieving in 12 months?"
5288,"I agree with much of this. My thinking has been that the institutional money may just make the volatility more exponential and the crash harder. As in, the institutions may just follow the patterns that the other investors and general public has followed, but now there's much more money involved. For the record though, only one crypto YouTuber I watch thinks it might be a supercycle"
5289,For not being click bait that’s a very click baitish title. Gotta put a question mark after Tesla selling lol.
5290,Bring it on 🔻 I need more BTC
5291,I love hearing every side! Make your own judgement and formulate your own plan.
5292,Ethereum
5293,"BUY  POLKADOT (DOT), REN, SYNTHETIX, AND CHAINLINK. I BOUGHT CHAINLINK BACK AT .45 CENTS. I THINK THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THESE INTERESTING PROJECTS .
I HAVE BEEN INTO MINING BTC AND LTC SINCE 2012, ETHEREUM SINCE 2016, I BOUGHT RIPPLE XRP AT .0065 AND NEO (ANTSHARES) ICO BACK UNDER 2 BUCKS. GOT LUCKY AND ALSO LOST A LOT OF MONEY."
5294,...goodshit.
5295,"Hey Alex, just watched your video on nightmare mode. You were saying about cutting all sources of dopamine that's not relevant to your goals. Does that also include exercise? even if it's not relevant to my goals?"
5296,Voice of reason in this era of absolute madness. Manipulation is absolutely sick these days and the dumb fall for it. If you lads believe in crypto so much why not buy crypto backed with actual real assets like gold. That would make at least some sense.
5297,The only project Who Will make you rich is xrp buy now or cry later😉🚀
5298,"Zoom out Alex and you’ll see just how much of a parabolic jump Bitcoin has had over the last year.

It’s literally a vertical wall that absolutely has to come down at some point."
5299,So cryptocurrency is going to zero?
5300,FUD
5301,How low could it get ? Any speculations?
5302,"Couldnt be more right in what you said, and many wont say this, liked and subscribed! thanks"
5303,I might be naive but I like this guy. Straight and to the point. Doesn't come across as a used car salesman. Backs up his opinions with information. Makes a closing statement and he's out
5304,"Well then put your money where your mouth is. Me, I'm not getting out of the market."
5305,"OMG, bla, bla, bla...so much talk about nothing...become and expert, than jump into explaining..."
5306,You need more commercials/
5307,Tesla is Selling or Tesla will Sell??? Be more accurate Thnx!!..!!
5308,Expecially or especially ??
5309,Investing in crypto is a more lucrative way of making money
5310,I’d probably buy a Tesla in the stock market crash
5311,This YouTuber is a realist all the others tell you to buy in a bull market and sell in the bear market and it’s going to 300000 usd tomorrow a million the next day
5312,"Yes tesla would dump, the expensive cars are nice but goal is affordable cars to replace gas."
5313,"11:00 Loses in Bitcoin, once in company's balance sheet, are tax deductible dummy"
5314,Hope a big crash comes because everbody thinks crypto is easy money i really hope a big crash comes
5315,Just looking at it I think granny is having stroke lol thanks for link aswell
5316,I did hear something about Tesla planning to sell it...
5317,Who here is not a bot 😂
5318,"I don't get it, is he saying that we shouldn't invest into crypto rn because of the incoming crash or that we shouldn't invest into Bitcoin. It seems kinda obvious not to invest into Bitcoin rn since its so high but surely theres still money to be made from alt coins, right???"
5319,"Dude, you are just a bitcoin hater. All your videos are trash bitcoin, dump bitcoin, bitcoin going to crash lol don't watch this guy."
5320,XRP/XRPL is a working product
5321,"Dude you're talking to the wrong people. The general consensus is that Bitcoin is going to $200,000. The debate is whether it goes to $2 million. Come back to planet Earth when you have time. ALSO,
Tesla and Saylor mean nothing to Bicoin. Micheal Saylor is as influential as Alex Becker, no offense but I've never heard of Michael Saylor in my life until a few months ago. If that's your argument for a crash it's worthless. TESLA is even more worthless with a 10% stake compared to 100% with Saylor. No bad press can change Bitcoin. As you said, nobody really cares about Tesla, so why would anyone care about what Tesla will do if they will sell Bitcoin, nobody really give a fly if things are as dire as you say."
5322,"Good way to get hits man, this is the bad news channel"
5323,"the economy and the equities are completely decoupled at this point......Ole Joe is about to push a 3-4T jobs bill.....The fed says they will support equities.......but what you are saying is BTC goes to 100-150k???  welllllllllll, I'll take that any day......and gtfo.....I was thinking of selling NOW......Everyone and their brother thinks 100k-150k, i say it doesnt make it there."
5324,I suggest that you give real explanations instead of just making pseudo technical analysis that does not apply to BTC
5325,should I sell my bitcoin ??
5326,At this moment all I can say is anyone not investing in cryptocurrency is Missing out on a huge opportunity
5327,"...and Alex, remember we are looking at the onset of CBDC conversion of our major fiat currencies. If they flip that switch when you are sitting on a pile of fiat, what's stopping them from programming that new digital cash to be incapable of buying bitcoin?"
5328,"You sound like a bitcoin hater... you cant predict when the crash is coming. Obviously a dip is going to happen thats inevitable. Thats how charts work, but stop making it seem like its a bad thing, once it dips itll bounce to make new highs in the future. Stop being so damn negative, holy fuck. Bitcoin hasnt even broke its low yet, start talking when that happens.... until then, sit back relax and see what happens...
smh"
5329,This guy is a DoorKNob
5330,Some1 will replace Elon to be the big hero I promise
5331,"I like your sobering counter argument to the euphoria. We do need to remember that we are all neurotically damaged imperfect creatures, 20 percent of which are prone to complete hypnosis. You might be underestimating the fact that the dollar is in a kamikaze dive and that could still, even in a worst case scenario, lead to institutional buying if it dips. I'm not so sure that could take a year and even if the temptation to sell is there there are enough Whales who know that bitcoin is so technologically far ahead of fiat it just isn't funny. So I guess we need to watch the fundamentals instead of Netflix."
5332,You are a poser weren't you an Ecom guy just talking bad about bitcoin some time ago. I feel you are trying to move to a community where you feel you can try and remain relevant because no one is using shopify anymore.  Don't take crypto info from non crypto people.
5333,Tesla sucks
5334,"You think like an average person 
Nothing wrong with it
At least you’re average and not below average"
5335,"Ya dude, well anyone wanna sell their btc get with me and I’ll get it off your hands 🙌"
5336,Click Bait.
5337,"This video is comedy gold.    Well if you find clickbait, wild speculation & a really really bad T/A funny that is.  The drawing lines on the screen are especially funny.  Folks don't fall for this rubbish!"
5338,"Do I have to assume that Michael Saylor is a con man?, sad..."
5339,Bro did you hear about Crypto Corgis?
5340,"At the end of the day, the world still runs on FIAT. Musk just blew up 3 rockets. Yea, hes already filthy rich, but why not be even richer? Especially THIS easily.. also, in a nutshell, people need to be fiat rich before they become bitcoin rich. And we are in all time high zones that are 3x higher than last time. Next time could be 10x higher! But when people have chances to make life changing gains.. what seems more probable to you?"
5341,I think he shorted Bitcoin
5342,"""I'm not in a foxhole with you... we're playing poker with loaded guns under the table"" That's an understatement."
5343,"Those people in 2017 actually lost nothing if they didn't sell. In fact, they're sitting on huge gains as of today."
5344,It's as if fiat cash is going to disappear lol... FUD in general
5345,"When you see celebrity CEO's doing weird things be very very skeptical. The idea that Musk and the CFO took on the cute titles of Technoking and Master of Coin is an unhealthy sign. What are they covering? What are they distracting from? Well, they have a humongous market cap car company that doesn't sell meaningfully sell cars. Musk is terrified of a crash in stock price and he sees it coming. He told his employees about this fear a year ago."
5346,If the stock market crashes... Bitcoin is going to crash as well.

5348,"Bitcoin POW is not the answer, mined and controlled 65% in China, does not follow green agenda, and you are absolutely right it's a hedge against the failing dollar...GREAT reset here we come!"
5349,LOL CLICKBAIT
5350,11:59 Nice sound effects mate keep it up 🚀🚀
5351,One of the reasons Bitcoin is up this much is because of the upcoming great reset. Money gets taken out of the monetary system. Pretty much common sense and also tells you that it will not come back down again.
5352,Oh MAn....you are simply the Greatest youtuber guru i've ever encounter in my life.....cheeeers
5353,"Govt debasing the currency 15-20% annually and you recommend selling btc for USD?  The ""day trader"" mind-set sounds stressful. God bless you all"
5354,"the thing that is actually different this time, is the fact that we're on a brink of a huge financial crisis. people are looking for ways to store value. the stock market is manipulated beyond belief, so people jump at crypto. literally EVERYTHING is overvalued nowadays (that's actually where the inflation is hiding), so keeping fiat is probably the worst strategy."
5355,"The problem with your thesis is that nothing ""logical"" about the market today."
5356,When Elon bought his crypto it didn’t even make a dent in January. So one person selling their BTC won’t effect the market. It’s everybody’s else that matters
5357,"even if tesla would have 5bln in btc and they sell it's nothing in comparison to the btc market cap which sits above 1trln, so 5bln will not make much of a difference."
5358,Bruh. I Agree With You 1000%
5359,"Remember guys: diamond hands. 

Don't let the whales and institutions scare you. A financial mega crisis is coming and fiat will be worth as much as toilet paper (if at all). Invest in crypto, rare metals... and that's it I'd say. Stock is gonna crash HARD. Keep on HODLING!"
5360,Dumb click bait
5361,It's a speculation.  But not a pretty one!
5362,Great video but damn clickbait🤣
5363,"This guy doesn't get it yet.  Dollars are worthless, you sell your dollars to make bitcoin profit."
5364,"What did Elon buy BTC at?  I think it was about $40,000 when he announced it and thats when the market jumped.  So, yeah, thats 40% profit ASSUMING it was all at $40k.  It was $1.5B so selling now is what?  $600m profit?  Not too shabby....except...The guy is worth $160B though so its not really significant in that sense to him (about 1/3 of 1% of his Net Worth), nor is it going to colonize Mars.  It makes much more sense for him to prop the Crypto Market up longer term than to send it crashing down and fuck a lot of people over.  He is NOT your typical greedy fuck.  But who knows?  Just my opinion..."
5365,"Hey, AlexB thanks for another good vid. 
Elon did announce that TESLA will take bit coin as payment for their supercars, not sure when though.. so even if he does sell his hoard he could potentially gain a lot back after the crash through car sales..!"
5366,Top Notch Top notch
5367,making money without creating any value or helping anybody cannot be sustainable. No different than gambling in a casino.

5373,"More likely is that they are keeping their treasury portfolio balanced, let's say they keep it 2% bitcoin, 98% cash. They keep selling when it goes up, and buy when it comes down. That's the way to hedge a portfolio correctly. It has a balancing effect on bitcoin. It's very unlikely that they wait for the top and then dump everything, or just keep hodling forever."
5374,"I don't know who needs to hear this, you've got to stop saving money to buy luxurious and exotic cars, invest your money wisely to get richer, buy crypto currencies, gold and so many others if you really want financial success"
5375,".here's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull, but BTC is going nuclear. A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back holding and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Marcus who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months. After getting in touch with Marcus Murphy an expert in cryptography, who showed me how to use his program to make transactions and got 41.3 btc in 3 moths with him. if you are looking for a way to increase your portfolio or investment.

5384,"The cryptocurrency's first price increase occurred in 2010 when the value of a single Bitcoin jumped from around $0.0008 to $0.08. Paper hands panicked and sold. 

I sold most of my BTC for $100, could never buy it back. 

Just saying. Same FUD we have been hearing since 2010."
5385,I remember all the people in 2017 saying it was going to 100k that cycle...
5386,truth
5387,F...king click baiting !!!
5388,Nah....
5389,This is B.S.
5390,When it is going up the only thing you should be thinking about is selling.. when it is going down you should only be thinking about the best place to buy.. Almost no one does this.
5391,There is no point in holding?
5392,This is frightening and why are you the only one that is seeing it from a pessimistic view ? It very hard to not be emotional about investing when its so all over the place...

5406,*May your day's be long Achievershack_service thanks for blessing my coinbase  that worth 2btc🙏🙏 I really appreciate your effort in my life*
5407,What are the odds you thing the stock market crashes by December
5408,It's ironic how Alex says he's a beginner but still has the best crypto channel LOL
5409,"Really the main thing to understand is that in 15 years, the price of bitcoin will be higher than 50k. You can almost guarantee that. 

So what’s the point of worrying about a crash in the recent future?"
5410,This guy has a distorted view. I myself and the company I keep are proof something has changed in the cryptocurrency market. I know dozens of middle class folks as myself who have entered cryptocurrency market over past few months. Cryptocurrency is now discussed around the coffee pot at my office. Many I know who don't have faith in stocks pulled money from 401k without penalty last year and transferred funds to cryptocurrencies. Mostly through coinbase. So what does that tell? This is bigger than Tesla or Elon Musk.
5411,""" I see the writtong on the wall"" !!!! What wall??? Gree. Maybe we dont  want to sell at all."
5412,Bullshi 😂😂
5413,"Dollar is losing value and Bitcoin is under valued easy to handle asset. I don't see reason to hold any fiat money against BTC, gold and silver."
5414,TLDR : Only bet what you're willing to lose.
5415,You just hate bitcoin saying it will have the biggest crash it ever had before  is just spreading fud and if you didn't know bitcoin's having is what runs this hole market so have a little respect for bitcoin please
5416,Buy the news sell the hype
5417,"Real talk lol love it unlike these channels hodl moon bs lol.
Can't wait for the dump 10x lev short"
5418,“This time it’s different” is the worst thing you can say when it comes to the stock market/crypto. History repeats itself and the bubble bursts when we least expect it.
5419,As long as price goes up and down I make money.
5420,If Bitcoin is moving towards a major crash...then will Bitcoin be able to recover from a price crash? That's the question we crypto investors need to ask.
5421,From reading the title of this video my first thought is... Is this a good opportunity to buy in?
5422,"You think hes gonna go down with the ship, especially when he could just... not?  Precisely 👍🏽"
5423,fake - another trash clickbaiter
5424,Interesting hypothesis but at the end of the day if the stock market crashed and in addition markets faltered and people stopped buying Tesla is would not matter what Tesla Balance Sheet holds i.e. FIAT/ GOLD or BITCOIN? The key issue would be to fix its operating costs in a downturn market. Making up earnings from Balance Sheet earnings does not make the core business right if its bleeding cash? A more likely scenario is Tesla would use its B/S for loans that would lien on the BTC held..SO no need to sell their holdings. The second issue is the underlying issue of the government printing more money. As you say the trend of BTC over 10 years is upwards and at x time in the future will be worth $500K or $1m etc...so again Tesla selling BTC and converting to cash that is actually going down by 20% a year in real value would not be a good business move? The smart move is for the company to hold BTC as a hedge and an asset to borrow money against.
5425,What happen with the final music?
5426,Good video
5427,"SELL

5430,FUD King
5431,😂😂😂 FUD. hey all his followers... there’s this thing called on chain data that tells you exactly what’s going on on the blockchain. Funny how you say look at the “writing on the wall” however you don’t use on chain data. So you’re right you shouldn’t even be giving advice. You need cheap Bitcoin so you’re fussing to try to get more cheap Bitcoin. On chain data will tell you when it’s time to get out the market you bafoon you don’t have to guess you clown. My goodness it’s so clear what you’re doing and it’s painful to listen to your ridiculous points without even looking at what you would need to look for in order to say these things. Oh and by the way the secret to the universe isn’t to have a pessimistic view 😂😂 this is the worst video I’ve ever seen.
5432,This channel was much better when you did your SEO streams before you rebranded into a shill.
5433,I want it to dip so bad so I can buy crypto on sale.
5434,I hope it crashes to ass for a few months.   Give me a chance to load up lol.
5435,"I'm not a master trader by any means, but the big bois will take bits of profit on the way up, and then wait for confirmation it will continue down to cash out completely."
5436,"I mean honestly if your only goal ""become a millionaire"" ur just begging to make a dumb decision and be disappointed...I think many will become millionaires in this current bull market but it's not the right mentality as hodlin can be very dangerous. As hard as it is trad!ng Crypto is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just study the charts and the support resistance and pay attention to what's going on, I’m not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s!gnals from Max Pashman. He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin. You can easily get to him on teleqram (@pashmancrypto ) for any Crypto related issue."
5437,"Buying and holding btc at any price should never be called stupid... Even if it's at the top of the market just before a crash. Yes it will hurt for a few years, but if you truly understand how BTC will be a multi million dollar world asset in the future...then it's never a bad time to buy and hold btc. In 20 years people will call spec traders stupid for trading btc for hyperinflated paper dollars worth pennies."
5438,"When it crashes this time, we'll be lucky if ""America"" is still the country we were born in!!! Hell, it's almost unrecognizable now FFS!!  This goes a lot deeper than just crypto and the stock market crashing, there are a group of people who are going to eat this country alive!!! Good luck to everyone!"
5439,May be unpopular opinion but I think he’s right on this one. Best thing anyone can do is don’t bet your rent money on it. He’s right on about being a lot of paper hands in this now.

5446,Worst YouTuber of all time. Unsubscribe for this narcissist garbage 👎🏼
5447,"NGL i approached this video with an open mind, looking to hear a bear argument on crypto. But your analysis is less convincing than what the clowns on MSM come up with. Surprised you didn’t mention the XRP lawsuit or the government cracking down. Pretty disappointing"
5448,Real talk 💯
5449,disliked video for title. watched whole vid then changed dislike to like. Good to have a level head
5450,Thanks for bringing these perspectives to crypto brother. Always enjoy these videos.
5451,"Just so ppl know, cause this man didn't even tell ya, there are time limits on btc bill runs.
They have been getting a bit longer each time
 first bull run 700 days from halving peak
Second halving was 900 days
This one prolly 1050ish days.
Sometime around January this year
If you think btc is overvalued at 50k...
I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but cash ain't one"
5452,If Bitcoin is “trackable digital gold” so why no one pays sales taxes buying BTC? When you buy physical gold you have to pay sales taxes.
5453,"i do however agree that the whole ""it's diferent this time because of the institutions narrative"" is definitely overblown. lately the news of this institution or this bank bought bitcoin hasn't been moving the price at all. the type of news that 6 months ago would have moved bitcoin 20% in a day, isn't moving it anymore lately."
5454,"Fair point,  but you have to put bank money to get house money to play with. Just riskier the later you wait into the bullrun."
5455,It will actually be Mt. Gox that will crash the bitcoin market. They're due to sell after October...they have 8 billion dollars worth of bitcoin
5456,"I agree with every word this guy said.
Institutions sell non-performing assets all the time. And even if they know bitcoin is coming back, why NOT sell high and re-buy when you can get even more of it for cheap."
5457,"the flaw in your logic is that a few billion worth of bitcoin won't even come close to enough to put tesla or other companies into profit. if it was microstrategy and bitcoin represented half or more of their companies worth then selling would make a huge difference. but company like tesla, their bitcoin represents like 1% of the value of their company if that."
5458,Some people care about the Earth. I can't see how Tesla is relevant to that though...

5467,"I listened all the way to min 10.. I was confused when this guy said gross would sell and somehow drop the Bitcoin value. Does he think there’s 20 Bitcoin on earth? Tf.. “exaggerated #” but that’s how ridiculous his claim is.. and at min 10 he says Tesla stock would end because EV market would drop with a market crash. Tesla doesn’t only make cars, very misinformed to make such claims."
5468,"builds up his platform by incentivizing people to invest in crypto, boasts constantly with his profits on his channel and when shit hits the fan he goes ""we are no friends. everybody on his own"". what a weasel, if i ever saw one."
5469,"""I'm not expert, I don't understand cryptos, I just see this coming"" oh, ok"
5470,Our a clown ass
5471,Click bate bitch ass
5472,"To extra cautious and skeptical is good. However all your arguments are geared towards people thinking in the short term. I mean i doubt tesla bought bitcoin for short term, its all long term as they believe, like you, that bitcoin will be worth a lot in the next 5/6 years from now..."
5473,"great content alex!! you are on point! what if we don't even go any higher, def a possibility too! thankksss"
5474,Lol just watch Michael Saylor
5475,"Btc crashes with the stock market. If Tesla crashes, we're all getting rekt"
5476,"Which tesla's losses? A decrease in stock price it's not a loss. Also, BTC will go to 100k or more and then back to 30/50k or probably just to 100k for 2, 3 years until next halving who knows. Point is, Tesla will just hold, and buy more. By the end of the year you will see."
5477,Lol well... cycles peak about 18 months after the halvening... that puts us at Xmas 2022. But it would make sense that there is a decent LH.. keep in mind you only “lose money”  if you sell... the best strategy is dollar cost averaging in and out
5478,"I started investing around end of 2016 - 2017 and was around for that bullrun, I have never had a tonne of money in, only what I could afford to loose and I did loose. No one saw the crash, no predicted it and it just happened.  So many ppl saying, it's gonna go up and it did, for a little bit and then it just dropped off a cliff. I'm not saying the bullrun is over right now but I am saying be fearful in this market BC it can turn on a dime overnight. Have an exit strategy or be prepared to hold bags for a long long time. I only trade altcoins with the DCA profits I got from investing from 2018 till now and even that it's only 20% ish of those gains"
5479,Good I wanna buy more
5480,Ok let the blackfriday begin 👏
5481,I am currently growing my portfolio with expert Mr Victor Dawson trade signals because they are accurate and gives you consistent earnings.
5482,"I was holding so many bags of shitcoins after the last bullrun, but this time its different, right? Finally, some of those shitcoins have doubled and tripled in value and I have sold everything. As soon as things double, I sell. I am also shorting the stock market. The crash will be epic, you will not witness a crash like this in your lifetime, and there will be noe place to hide as everything is overvalued. Its just a matter of time. What goes up... ;)"
5483,you're the worst...my god.
5484,"Tesla will hold onto bitcoin and will buy more and more in the next years and decades. Model 2 is coming and will cost 25k. You say people don't care about planet earth. Maybe you, because me and many others do. In fact, it's not just Tesla, my next car (now don't own one because I care about environment) is going to be electric. NIO, Tesla, whatever. People like you don't know what they're talking about."
5485,"Expert Mr Dawson thank you for the profits made this week  🙏🙏
He's really good ❤️"
5486,*@PALMY01 ON TELEGRAM APP YOU REALLY SURPRISE ME I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE 10BTC PROFIT RETURN SIR*
5487,Lol this makes no sense from a corporate tax perspective. They won't sell their assets to reduce losses. Makes no sense.

5490,"While a crash is inevitable and it sounds really great to sell near the top and buy the dip for the bear cycle there is a huge problem. No one knows the future. It's impossible to know when the other shoe will drop so I see crypto like buying a house in 2008. No one knew when the music would stop but everyone who had 0 leverage and ignored the market and held their homes or bought second ones in 2011 are doing just fine. Buy a little ada and bitcoin today, tomorrow, and some number of months from now when it's worth 10% as much as it is now. It doesn't feel great but most people will eat shit doing it any other way."
5491,soo... buy the dip!!!!!
5492,His success stories are everywhere
5493,"I’m a bitcoin maximalist, but I completely agree with his analysis of what is going to happen. I don’t plan on selling ever. I just DCA in over time every day and then I buy dips and have a 10 year horizon."

5502,Just read the title and went straight to comments section ....this guy is  really desperate for attention....another Nostradamus who wants to help YOU guys to make  money ...or save you from loosing it......Watch and learn!!...freak out!!!....asteroid is gonna hit cryptomarket soon...run!!
5503,And Tesla’s not selling. Quit spreading false info.
5504,This guys the most negative person towards Bitcoin I’ve ever seen. Last person I take advice from.
5505,Ok so when is it gonna crash? Like this month or next? Idk
5506,Salty u sold at 30k?
5507,"Say's ""Not click bait"". Then admits the he has no idea if Tesla will sell and doubt it will."
5508,He's contact Mr Dawson?????
5509,Who else observed Mr Dawson trading strategy last week was a massively boom can't wait to earn more by next week.
5510,"Maybe you need to warn Jordan Belfort who has just bought in. Lol You guessing that's a fact, like we all are but stating Tesla have sold on your video is incorrect, u founded and unfactual. - Dangerous rhetoric mate"
5511,"9:40 Never has a truer phrase been spoken! Well done Alex, and well said."
5512,"Brother, if you look deeper into this you’ll learn why bitcoin going down is good for tesla. Specifically how they filed their holdings. They can ride off their entire tax obligation if the btc value loss is enough."
5513,Wow 😯...... Mr. Victor of financial education has really made name for himself
5514,What about just holding long for 5-10 years instead of timing the market?
5515,I never thought I would be richer Today all my gratitude to this special and nice Mr Dawson he is just too good👍
5516,"Maybe yes and maybe not, no one knows, in the meanwhile you got some clickbait."
5517,As long as Ellon is a head of tesla he never sell any Bitcoin
5518,Why not put your profits into precious metals? Thousands of years track record.

5528,Well done 👍 for heads up
5529,Fuck this loser
5530,"I was skeptical about investing with him, Mr Victor Dawson at  first but I'm really happy I took that bold step because the profit I've made is wonderful"
5531,This guy is a moron and basically uploading click bait
5532,Dont be surprised when you and every other tom dick and harry who thinks they are just going to buy right back into btc in a year at 80% reduced cost dont get your chance. I see more people expecting that than i do people expecting bitcoin to have a super cycle. Very few people most of whom are new into crypto actually think there will be a super cycle.
5533,I wouldn't worry about a crash unless it dips under 45k. Bitcoin trades sideways and loses dominance during altcoin season. I think your approach is purely emotionally based. Well see who is right in a couple weeks!

5540,I have been seeing good reviews about Mr Dawson on Twitter please how can I contact him??
5541,"i admire the efforts u put in your videos mate, digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally, its hard for for anyone going against them these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). i trade using signals from trade expert Jacqueline A Adams, with is guide and signal service i've made over $450k worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclinde issues connect her on @Jacqueline_signals teligram"
5542,"Yeah, He's good and guaranteed with him you get to see Bitcoin investments from a different angle working with him is all about win win win."

5545,"I really appreciate your transparency and being real, tbh this never crossed my mind but thanks for opening my eyes to a whole new perspective!"
5546,I'm not here to converse but to share my testimony for what I confirmed he's trust worthy and best option Ever seen... Thanks sir Victor.

5550,This guy has had some points. But this video. Man you sound like such an idiot ''everyone lost all their money''. Stop being so damn salty man jeez. And to me this looks like a liquidation crash just like two weeks ago.
5551,I was suggest everybody watch this to the end he makes some amazing points very smart guy really enjoyed your video it would be foolish not to watch this whole entire video make your decision at that point making money is what we’re all here to do I prematurely commented below for that I apologize
5552,nah.
5553,Somebody's got a short position 👀
5554,Yeah am a living testimony of Mr Victor Dawson
5555,"Mr victor Dawson is obviously the best invested $4,500 and he made profit profit of $28,950 for me just in 15 days"
5556,Yuppie who needs kids because he has too much time on his hands.... You want to change the world Alex start with the kids.
5557,Mr. victor Dawson has changed my financial status for the best. All thanks to my aunty who introduced him to me
5558,"What are Tesla going to sell into? Dollars....what a stupid move that would be? besides the massive tax bill Tesla would have on the gains if they sold....remember Telsas holding in only a tiny % of their cash, why would they sell?. I can't see any of the massive institutions dumping and if that doesn't happen there is no way we can have the worst crash. There isn't enough to sell for that 'worst crash' to happen. The fact that a 4m52sec he stated that Amazon pays a dividend really makes me question this guys validity and motive.

10m34sec - mentioning that Tesla pay a dividend - like Amazon, they don't pay a dividend either!?"
5559,Not click bait....Dick bait....lol...
5560,6:58 N in different
5561,Click bait AF! Tesla did not sell.
5562,Mr. victor Dawson has changed my financial status for the best. All thanks to my aunty who introduced him to me
5563,I've been an investor and I can tell it changed my life for better 😊😊 investing in forex and crypto will be one of the widest thing to do
5564,"I can't imagine someone having 'millions' in the market and not taking out at least a million just to be safe, but I'm sure it happens. Plus you say you're going to get out 'here' just before the top. That assumes you know where the top is. Also, how do you even know it's going to get to 'here' just before the top? Maybe the top is below 'here'."
5565,"What's funny is I've been in this for the last year like Alex. I focused on learning the cycles. Once we really started taking off in December I began living with this low level anxiety that the end is coming. 

I'm praying and begging for a hard crash at the end. I missed the 2018 crash. The bear market is where the most potential gains are. The likelihood they fall below that new floor is so remote, it's your best chance to make massive wealth."
5566,"How could crypto crash when it is the future? Personally, I will keep holding, and the more they sell the more dip I will buy as simple as it is :D"
5567,"yea and there is only 1 way to prevent this mega dipping after mucho gains, and that is to make hodling more attractive then trading (staking?)"
5568,Yeah sure stock and crypto yields more profits with the favourable market rise
5569,"Mr. Victor Dawson had been my trader in crypto currency, he's techniques is marvelous, made me see Bitcoin investments and forex trade from another angle, I keep making profits monthly. All thanks to you Victor."
5570,Bitcoin is the future investing in it now is the wisest thing to do now especially the current rise
5571,well isn't it the case that tesla can tax-out their btc losses`to pay less tax for the year ? thought it works like that... idk though...
5572,Thanks for the honest explanation
5573,"This guy is high, as I have said previously, do the oppostite and you are guaranteed to make money….oh and he isn’t that rich !"
5574,They say September I’ll start taking profits in July I don’t know what ur talking about u only fail when u don’t take profits buddy what crash for two month omg what a crash it’s not 2017 we have a good 5 years of rising
5575,"I honestly deeply hope this crash will come , so I can x4 my small holding !"
5576,"Imagine Alexs pain when he sells at 150k with the plan to buy back in at 50k, and then bitcoin slowly continues to climb for several years and alex has to buy back in at 300k lol"
5577,"Thank you so much for making these videos Alex.
I really appreciate you giving us awesome strategies and a reality check in the world of ""the church of bitcoin"". 
Everything you said makes a LOT of sense... I need to get away from all the hype.
Pleaseee...keep doing videos about crypto =) 
Thank you so much!!!

P.S.: say hi to Dodge Coin ops Scoot hehe

Deleted the last comment by mistake...ops :)"
5578,"Getting out? Rule #1 of blockchain, you get in, not out."
5579,"Goddamn, so refreshing to see a guy with his head on his shoulders talking about cripto like a normal reasonable person. Most of these chart analysis/moon howlers don't know shit and they are right 50% of the time which is about what you'd expect from people who are just guessing at what's gonna happen."

5582,YOU TAKE THE WIN OFF THE TABLE
5583,Yes...all the new money that's smart will take profit ...they have seen the charts and heard the horror stories
5584,Been in for a year....turned a few grand here and there...about 12k total.  Got 35k spark tokens when they come out....I'm over 50k with out that. I wont have to put in any more money ...playing with house money. Getting on the apy finance at this bottom....lmao....you have to sell Zil up from a penny to 20 cents...lol.  it's gone
5585,"I'm gonna sell 15 years from now,  hopefully i got the top lol"
5586,"ok, good luck with your plan. Just let us know when you dump on us."
5587,this is solid advice Alex! compared to the rubbish i see people pushing .. this is very sensible stuff!
5588,Bro. You keep calling it. Just let it go. Why do you care?
5589,Do you look at ops in financial space?
5590,This has been a good march and it usually isn't....we are paying dues now in the long term hodl bags....I started scaling out of all the new money I put in the other day......I'll get back in with it at the bottom .
5591,A couple months after the crash it'll go right back up.
5592,👰🏼‍♀️
5593,Grandpa’s for thanksgiving 😂😂😂
5594,I own a grand spanking total of $58.00 dollars Bitcoin that was bought with a stimulus check. I have no reason to sell.
5595,"Yes of course, what goes up must also come down, but not yet."
5596,"Got out of ETH as well, luckily at no loss. That whole miners being crybabies has me a bit worried ngl."
5597,"No one lost money in the last crash, unless they sold, or they were holding shit coins."
5598,Clown
5599,Your mates didn’t loose mills if they still owned  the coin just the value of their coin depreciated because my mates kept their bitcoin during the crash and now their even more up
5600,The main think is when you look at the daily chart and yearly it doesn’t matter if it crashes year in and year out the graph goes up
5601,I say it crashes at 100k
5602,I don’t think it will crash as bad as history as shown it may crash %50 but in bitcoin point of view it’s not that bad
5603,"Alex assumes everyone is a trader like him.  If all those people who lost money in 2017 simply held, they'd be up even more now than they were in 2017, and by a lot.  Some of us are planning on holding everything for 10+ years.  I'll buy more if there's a crash"
5604,"OTC trades are allowing institutions to get in without moving the price. Because they are able to do that, bitcoin is still well below 100k. They have a price target in mind and when that target is reached they will pull. If they wanted to hold for the long term they would want to move the price up as much as possible so the little people can no longer influence the price. This is exactly what I think WILL happen the next time around, but as for this time, it is 100% pump and dump. The next round, it will be so far out of peoples price range that only the 1% can afford it. You could technically hold through it but when when will the next time be? Some say the halving in 3.5 years but if that's the case I guarantee there will be a market crash, huge inflation, massive unemployment, commodity shortages or all of the above to force anyone that doesn't want to be in a homeless shelter to sell.

And don't forget about all the exchanges that will go belly up. If your crypto is on anything but a hardware wallet when this crash comes, 95% of people will lose it all to the 1% when the exchanges go down. The people have the power with crypto if they just held it ALL on hardware or some sort of keyed wallet. When you keep your crypto on an exchange you are loaning it to them to do as they please just like banks do with fiat. YOU allow them to manipulate the price by letting them hold what you view as valuable. Take that power away from them by getting it all off exchanges(banks) and the people have the power. This is what crypto was made for and meant to do but people have given up their power by allowing exchanges to come in and manipulate your store of wealth.

Its all nice saying all this so everyone understands but in the end, history shows that not enough people are going to do the right thing (use hardware wallets), and their currency and store wealth will continue to be manipulated beacuse we are either forced or tricked into it. Fiat was forced, crypto is being tricked into control. Crypto does not require exchanges, banks, or regulation, all that is and was built into it so in theory it could be a perfect currency if everyone took back their power and used hardware or keyed wallets on their phones etc."
5605,gotta love these click bait titles ;)
5606,You really do have such a refreshing valuable channel. You comment on facets that are often overlooked by the usual crypto youtubers. Thanks man
5607,"I'm noob here. But if bitcoin is going down and everyone is selling, where the money comes from? Who is buying? If you see crash is happening at the moment who are those people still willing to pay?"
5608,"Bitcoin will fail as a get-rich Ponzi scheme. Unless it has a stable value then it can never be used as a currency..Imagine you borrowed $250,000 equivalent in Bitcoin from a bank to buy a house 5 years ago...you would probably owe $2,000,000 by now due to its value increase, unlike interest rate rises in a Fiat currency on a mortgage..The only way a cryptocurrency will be used as a currency is if it has a stable value backed by a physical asset like Gold....Bitcoin has no value at the moment except what someone is willing to pay to get rich off it...And sooner or later a mass evacuation will take place as speculators cash in leaving the latecomers to the party treading water trying not to drown as they see their cash go down the plughole. Some say Bitcoin is a replacement for Gold, I see it as fools gold blinding Millenials into thinking they'll be able to invest, get rich, buy a house and retire early on the profits...Governments are already investing in software to track and trace crypto, so taxes etc won't be far behind to kill it off..Yes, there will be a cryptocurrency but it will be run by and have a value set by the Governments of the world...The world order is not going to collapse by letting crypto run riot and steal the thunder by hiding cash from the Tax Man for the benefit of get rich quick Millenial speculators...Bitcoin is a great idea for a quick profit but long term, I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. The Governments and Banks are already planning to take control of Crypto because they know the game is up with controlling Fiat/Gold/ and Silver. And Gold and Silver (real money) will be the only safe haven until the way we use money all changes over the next few years and A true cryptocurrency we can all use finally arrives."
5609,great video
5610,AMZN doesn't pay dividends.
5611,Everything you say makes sense!
5612,Thank you for your advice. It is always better to be prepared and never be too much greedy. In order for you to win someone else must lose so much truth behind this sentence.
5613,"I think you are wrong.

Institutions and large corporations won’t be selling as they aren’t traders and that is not how real value and wealth is generated at all.

Corporations and institutions buying this asset class right now (BTC) aren’t looking at a 1 year timeline or trying to trade in and out of an asset and have taxable events.  They are looking at the longer timeline and they are interested in growing the value of their organization.

They are also using BTC as the superior asset over most others to protect their cash reserves from incoming hyper inflation which will light their USD they hold on fire.  With 0 to negative interest rates among us and not going anywhere anytime soon it is incredibly hard for them to find an asset class that can counteract their reserves being eaten up and that is where BTC and it’s historical 200%+ APY (which sill go much lower as it stabilizes) comes into play for them.

We will have the first US ETF soon. BTC is getting widespread adoption and being incorporated into our financial structure and while we will have a bear market and prices will correct after accelerating too quickly like they always do, you won’t see these large corporations and institutions selling any BTC which will lesson the blow of the bear market crash substantially.

The best advice would be to be careful with alt coins as those are very overvalued right now. 

BTC is not overvalued and the strategy should be to accumulate BTC for the long term for your family and never plan on selling but rather borrow against the asset when needed as it continues to increase in value faster than any asset in history."
5614,Crashes happen when people sell 🤷🏻‍♂️ keep telling people there’s going to be a crash causes a crash..
5615,Kind of looks like that shits happening now
5616,TESLA is so overvalued and is the going to be the most affected stock during the next stock crash
5617,"""I got into BTC a year ago, I just super believe in this technology."""
5618,Alex looking dope AF
5619,Common sense 👏
5620,"Alex, if one of the big companies dump their Bitcoins, then the rest will buy it up for dirt cheap. All the coins they are being mined a day, 900 plus, are getting bought up by at least 3 known companies. Who really knows how many companies?  Coinbase is going public in a month.  Cardano is going to implement Goguen. Nevertheless, if you believe that, then please sell all your coins."
5621,"NOT GOING TO ZERO... helloooo BUY THE DIP IF IT FALLS HARD, what a great day that would be"
5622,Who's rug will you be on...when one side decides to pull the other side's rug from underneath?
5623,"your friends talk funny, those meetings must be fun xD"
5624,Do you use any trading indicators like market cipher?
5625,"I will tell you something. If you not sell, you will not loose. If you tell me, that someone has few mill. in btc in 2017 and went to 0, this is simple not  true, he has the pretty much same btc like before the crash. The only problem was, that he sold. If not, his btc will be now the exact same btc like before - the same value in btc. Only, I mean really only when he sell it right now, he will 3x money (or much more) than he put in btc during 2017..."
5626,Keep looking out for your followers bro 😉
5627,As soon as it gets to the top... I'm buying 😂
5628,Focus on the technicals
5629,"The concept of buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Daniel Wright services. , although i have been into numerous services but Daniel Wright stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Daniel it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel- gram ( @Danielwrightfx )."
5630,"52000-49000 boys, that is the straw holding our digitial dam"
5631,"You’re absolutely correct. This is why, as a new investor, I don’t buy Bitcoin. I’ll wait til we see a huge dip 😁"

At the time of writing, the cryptO was back at square one, trading at levels noted in the first week of March and most of February. The scale of the bearishness in Cosmos’s market was underlined by the alt’s indicators as while the Bollinger Bands projected a degree of near-term price volatility in the southbound direction, the MACD line was well under the Signal line.

1) 2017 BTC was only experiment, low trust. Today the common belive that the future belongs to Bitcoin. Even you say that. This conviction drives everyting. All dips will be bougt...
2)USD inflation, printing money economical collapse... all is just fuel for BTC
3) big money - with higher value and volume bitcoin will be less volatile. Less people will afford to buy full bitcoin and speculate. More stability in the future.
4) Investor are joining. You argued as if this point would be the only one. 1-3 are more important"
5698,"Not sure I agree that they ""don't get it"" or ""don't care"". Why would big companies actively encourage progress that can drive the markets away from what they're doing when their existing business models are earning them ""Disney money"".

5711,"It’s a long term game here Alex. The tax implications alone of institutions “dumping” their BTC balance sheets will keep them from selling, let alone the new era of equities management global rulers have clearly chosen.  Are you aware of the paradigm shift modern equities are making? Detachment from GDP and inflating away doomsday debt is the means being adopted by the FED and necessary for G7 countries to evolve to the next chapter of control they so desire. “Use cases” be damned, Crypto is a new asset class that IS AIDING in this incoming shift and was invented to do so. Saylor knows this. Musk knows this. Many more institutional managers know this.  They don’t give a $hit about short or even mid term corrections and they invented FUD.  You’re in for a surprise if you sell out this year my friend,  your welcome to of course but know that some insightful asshole like me will be blasting off with your shares of BTC/  the new “P2P protocol layer of the entire I.O.T.”  Gary Gensler-"

5733,My friend your Great ! I hope your wrong but everything sounds so realistic
5734,Agree with you 💯! All of these large corporations are jumping on the BTC wagon to hedge their companies against the impending crash so heck yeah they'll dump!! BTC is now a pump and dump coin for the elite and large corporations!! Not where retail investors should be placing all their eggs anymore!
5735,"So your premise is that the stock market is overvalued and will crash, everyone will then exit crypto to cover their losses. What if the reverse happens? The fed keeps printing, NQ/ES new all time highs, more and more btc gets transferred to institutional hands from retail hands, they have no incentive to sell for usd because they can continue to issue bonds for free, halvings get priced in and you paper handed and sold the 70k dip? Is crypto really ""overvalued"" when you look at the m2 money supply?"

5741,What you think to where it’s going to go down
5742,"False. Tesla will never sell. Losing money on bitcoin is a tax write off. Tax is not paid on bitcoin if it exceeds the bought price. So they have clean (non taxed) profits in the green (if they dont sell) and tax deductable losses in the red, since bitcoin is an asset class, not money. This is their tax hedge. Its a win win and the reason why every firm will hold bitcoin untill the law changes."
5743,I've been saying for months the reason these institutions are buying up all the Bitcoin it's because they want to control it they're scared of it and the 1% wants control of it therefore they want 99% of it

They interrupt every second thought you are trying to get out there. Or maybe optimize them to run on the breaks, when you take a breath, disable the mid-rolls, or whatever :D

5776,"You are kidding. We are at the sweet spot my friend. As an analyst, I can tell you we are at the same point as the tech market in the late 90s. No-one believed in the internet startups, they said that they couldn't see the value... We all see what happened. Institutional investment started to pour in and the hype proved very real - the rest is history. One thing you missed in your video was the focus on fundamentals. This is no longer ""a game"" as you state. You're right that companies like Cardano have no value and 99 percent of crypto is way overvalued. In fact, it has no value at all. In fact, Bitcoins only value is hype. However, as long as you are investing in companies that are under valued like VeChain with strong fundamentals, not trying to short the market and catch a falling knife, this is your chance to make a fortune. This is a bloody correction, which will lead to a parabolic increase for those crypto companies with strong fundamentals and for the market leader, which fuels itself solely on hype."

5784,I don’t know what time period this guy is talking about the stock market crashing but if more and more countries are getting vaccinated and people are allowed to go out and travel again the stock market and economy is gonna get boosted and I know that Tesla is pretty overvalued and overpriced but think about all the people that saved money during covid from not going out and travelling and are ready to spend it soon.......

5799,"Again, if Tesla is to sell, they can't move that amount of btc on an exchange they would not even get to sell 5% before the order books is dry and they have crashed the price. So they have to move it of the counter, again not reflecting the price. But again, news of tesla selling is a different story."
5800,"Draws a sine wave and doesn't use a tradingview chart.  Be careful following this guys alt trades when he goes into the new coins...they can rug pull for many reasons and being new means low liquidity so even harder to sell.  If you pick something with quality fundamentals with 5 billion or higher marketcap you'll do fine, new people always hop on coins back and forth losing money with bad risk management.  Pick your coin/s and stick with it.  Find a exit strategy for selling this bullrun and stick to it, example; sell your principal investment amt when you either 2x or 4x and then DCA out in increments.  Use a signal like rsi is above ~ 70 or higher on the weekly as time to reduce holdings.  Check out solid Alts like XLM."

Thats why i follow lessons and study technical analysis.

We still have the potentional that this is wave 1 of the impuls.

If a certain trendline is broken we have a long drawn correction, 
if another trend is broken, we can say the bullmarket is over and it will fall to its original trendline (wich is still a uptrend)

If Btc holds a certain level we still are in wave 5 of the potentional wave 1( its getiing confusing i know)
Let them sell, i will be watching and buying with the right reactions :)

5827,"The smart Bitcoiner doesnt even try and sell the top, we sell at the exact moment it becomes more beneficial to exit, which is just before the parabola and into the early ramping up of the final alt cycles.
That's some Samurai level shit I'm laying out for you there."
5828,Well...I do understand what you are saying. Damn. Idk what to do really. I see Bitcoin ATMs popping up all over...the us dollar is losing value...I dont know if it helps or hurts the USA dollar that we have all of these illegals coming through the border...hmm...I know it seems crazy unrelated but this administration is really crazy.
5829,You say you're not going deep into the game of chicken and get out way before the top.... but you don't know where the top will so you may already be deep in.  That curve you pointed to showing the top and where you're going to get out gives you the benefit of hindsight.  You don't have that now and won't have it until way after the top is in.  So are you going to decide when to get out Alex?
5830,But where all those us dollar that have recently been printed (%40 of all the dollar they have printed ever) wanna go? Real state? Stock market? Bitcoin? Gold? What does 1.9 trillion dollars mean? Doesn't it mean the whole market cap of crypto?
5831,I am going to HODL. I am in for long term. I will sell in 10 or 20 years. I ve been in since december.
5832,Another dose of Becker’s bipolar
5833,You know what makes me nervous? Every single YouTube ad I see nowadays is something about investing in crypto. That signals a top is near.
5834,"Guys... Listen
These dips are normal in the market."
5835,"Correct me if I am wrong, but why should Elon sell assets that manifest profits in his balance sheets. All he needs to do to keep his cash flow stable is to borrow against these assets. I believe his investment into BTC is a long term hedge against dollar inflation."
5836,This video is super important. Find myself buying into the hype more and more but this brings you back down to what reality feels like
5837,"he is absolutely right qnd completely hinest, just subbed. i pulled out everything to USDT last week bcz i was afraid people were in the euphoria stage. planning to re invest in Bitcoin only if it goes back to ATM otherwise i will wait for 42K, the market needs a healthy shake out to restore confidence, and that hasnt happened yet. The more it keeps going up, the more i get scared of investing again."
5838,I guess Here will cause 50% people sell their btc... being Safe is good
5839,Thank you for making this video. I’m been waking up at 4 am with this logic on my mind.  I’m going to continue my planning with this narrative in the foreground. ❤️
5840,these points really don’t apply for coins like vechain tho... thoughts??
5841,Keep the beard.
5842,In reality nobody knows what's exactly going to happen so thanks for this healthy dose of a very potential truth.
5843,DONT EVER SELL CAUSE THE  BIG WHALE WANTS YOU TO......     HODL
5844,"Are you sure this video is not ""Click Bake""? :) JK, love your videos"
5845,"How does this whole bitcoin thing work, I'm interested in it and I'm willing and ready to invest heavily in it but I'm gonna need an assistant from any trusted and productive professional"
5846,Bitcoin by itself? What about the company's that trade crypto currency's for customers and promises security for a small fee? As in PGI GLOBAL? I have done a bit of research on this PGI INVESTMENT plan however I feel 50 /50 about it. What do you think?
5847,"it's clickbait, because you said you THINK... so you've already failed."
5848,HODL    RIDERS  OF THE  STORM
5849,"Down voted for Click bait title. You are right of course. And btw, the dollar is about to collapse and the Chinese Yuan will become the trading currency of choice."
5850,"Wow, thank you for telling it like it is. I’m new to crypto and I needed to hear this!!"
5851,i miss the doom outro
5852,Staking now will get you your original investment back therefore you can ride the house money to the ground.....but that’s the difference between staking and day trade for quick big profits🤷🏼‍♂️💯
5853,"you better leave bitcoin, Alex."
5854,Tesla to a Ford Escape? Lol
5855,"exactly what i was locking for, thx"
5856,20 minutes ago was pretty comfortable
5857,Thank for the wake up call from dreamland
5858,"If you don't see the value in Cardano, you're looking at it the wrong way. Guess its just the pessimistic way you approach it, but still. Its okay to profit off coins, but don't dismiss the hard work and progress that's been made as a ""game"" or ""worthless""..  and to say it about the coin that actually has everything we would need for crypto to work, on it's roadmap. You must be priveleged asfff if you don't see what's going on around the world and why we need a decentralized currency. People like you get to sit there in front of a camera like a jester with all the money in the world to play with and take everything so lightly. In reality, Its your money that is worthless, its a ponzi scheme, the government has complete control and decides its value. You're so brainwashed into believing  the dollar has value, you dont even ask yourself what value is. quit youtube."
5859,🥇🥇🥇
5860,🥇
5861,So right
5862,The FUD we need
5863,"So, when to go out?"
5864,The only thing that's going to crash is your clickbaity videos.
5865,This guy doesn’t know anything
5866,"Pull profits where? What I see is that FED is inflating currencies causing market to rise, crash/correction was supposed to happen in 2008 but it was avoided by manipulating economy into a biggest bubble world has ever seen, this dead economy has no place to be this high but it still is going up defying gravity and its not stoping until we see hyperinflation."
5867,"@ 10:35 he says Tesla could sell to keep paying out their dividends ... shows how much he knows about Tesla also “Tesla has never declared dividends on our common stock. We intend on retaining all future earnings to finance future growth and therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future” that’s from Tesla’s website good job getting people to click and watch tho he knows how to do that but his information isn’t all correct. 👎🏻"
5868,Hey Alex could you mention a tittle of a book you recommend or currently reading?
5869,"You went 20x completely randomly my friend it is obvious you don't have knowledge of what is happening . 
In thta area you are a Lucky man nothing else!!"
5870,"Absolutely true .... this is business ... large organisations are in to make profits, they’re not interested to make crypto a loyal love affaire. ...."
5871,You speaked what i think
5872,Thank you for playing the devil's advocate. That video is extremely important and helpful.
5873,"1) Buy the dip
2) Doge is the peoples' crypto"
5874,"Ha lol, at first I wasn't feeling this video and was going to click off, but he has a very good point I'm definatly going to try and keep this perspective in mind.  Great video"
5875,Xrp buy
5876,No mention of the bitcoin stock to flow model?
5877,"Ok Alex so if You HAVE TO withdraw ALL YOUR money  at once which month would You choose ? If You must choose only one month , for example - April/ July / Octomber  or different one?"
5878,"People just lack common sense and they're selling themselves a dream. There is not a market where the price just goes up forever. If you see coin shilling YouTubers and other idiots who tell you WHEN and AT WHICH price the markets going to flip, then the suckers will keep on holding, and the whales will slowly cash out at the top 10% of the price volume (since they can't cash out at the very top because there's not enough volume). SO IF YOU ARE DENYING THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY ARE IN BEARS MARKET, JUST BECAUSE SOME IDIOTS ONLINE SAY BULL RUN WILL CONTINUE TILL SUMMER, YOU WILL LOSE, AND THEY WILL DUMP ON YOU."
5879,What is this for stupid title?
5880,People that expect short term gains will suffer but the key thing is to hold  long term.
5881,"You should have made this video two days ago when BitCoin was at 59K. It is funny how no one sees the crash coming, and they will pump the crypto until it collapses and then they talk sense about ""what is the value"". Today, crypto crashed, and you are talking about getting out before it is too late, and it is too late."
5882,So 3200 still in play?
5883,"Nice video❤, Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advised them against investing and trading forex while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially"
5884,Gramma and Grampa right around the corner coming to visit us. 😂
5885,Glad i sold
5886,XRP is not hypothetical.
5887,It’s gonna moon
5888,"Why are you not talking about Terra Luna Ecosystem? They are massive in Asia, please check Mirror Protocol and Anchor Protocol. Luna will be a TOP 5 project by the end of 2021. Please do research. Luna has 2.5 million crypto non users who pay with Luna every day"
5889,Be prepared like if it was 2018 all over again
5890,all i want is spammer commenting me and giving me a number where i could send all my life savings
5891,HODL with diamond hands!
5892,not even going to bother watching this CLICKBAIT TRASH JUNK
5893,"This is the type of pessimism that the market does not need right now! May your investment go to the moon and never look back. Always have an exit number in mind for every trade. If a coin crashes, shrug it, there’s many more fishes in the sea that will take you back to the moon! If you take a loss, you have no one to blame but yourself. You gotta be on these charts like a hawk, and if you’re busy, set up alerts and notifications. Play the game with calculation and technique. And just remember, this is only the beginning."
5894,Companies don’t even need to be in a bad position to sell.  If Bitcoin goes up they will sell to rebalance.  They won’t sell everything it a significant amount.
5895,OG HODLers of 10 years have sold too btw.
5896,10 adds in 20 min video...cmon man this is BS
5897,"whenever alex is speaking truth, people dislike and it proves his point"
5898,"Relax and calm. Put your emotions aside, buy a lot if it crashes and be happy if it pumps."
5899,"A fine dose of pessimism Alex.  I mean that in a complementary way.  This bull market has been a heady experience, but if you're not also aware of the bear case scenarios you are setting yourself for an unpleasant surprise somewhere down the line.   You are a man of some experience - more than many - but you have no illusions.  I think that's useful a this time in Crypto history.  Thanks."
5900,I’ll buy the dip after it crashes...
5901,"your right, i'll sell atleast 50% in may, ATLEAST, probably 75%"
5902,"2:22 chill out. You ONLY lose IF you sell. HODL, and you will get that (and more) back.

The main issue here? People invest more than they can afford. Panic kicks in -can't take rational actions.

Good luck everyone. For me, it's not over yet, but if it is, see you at the next one, as I will be HODLING every bag 🚀👍

ps: imagine closing this cycle for real with ETH at 1600.........they should kill me to believe it. Haha"
5903,The stock market and economy are not the same. Stock market moves lead the economic moves.
5904,"I don’t mind a crash but obviously....I know a lot of people do.

I got a lot of my BTC in 2015 from selling modded GTA Accounts I created after getting tired of using PayPal because I was encountering a lot of chargeback abusers.

And I never got rid of any of it and I don’t plan to anytime soon but I will take advantage of a crash without a doubt ."
5905,I hope it crashes so i can buy a shit tonne 😂
5906,"ACI Worldwide on its own clears over $10 trillion daily, and that's only 1 of Ripples partners, and Ripple has hundreds of high value institutional partners that need to move high volumes at low cost which xrp through Ripples ODL product will provide. It's too good and too cost efficient for them not to. Eventually not too long from regulatory clarity they will have the green light to open the flood gates. And the volume of transactions will demand Ripples ODL (on demand liquidity)"
5907,Thanks for the reality check. Bringing it back to perspective without the bullsh*t 👍👍👍
5908,"Wow, I lost you when you said no one cares about the earth. You sir are sad and have no faith in humanity. You would be surprised how many people want to help planet earth. I'm keeping my bitcoin,  I'm keeping my Tesla stocks and vehicles and I'm keeping my nft's. Oh and I'm keeping my gold. I'm keeping everything."
5909,We might hit $300k by EOY and the bubble will pop of a 90% correction sending us into a Bitcoin Winter that will last four years!
5910,"Alex but don't you think there are going to be even more institutions waiting to buy when it dips? There are many countries have yet to join and US institutions are leading the way. The ripple can take a few years as they are generally much more slower moving. 

And then there will be another halvening by the time  the slower institutions get their head around it (and you don't think people are going to try to front run it? There has been 3 cycles on the dot now.)

And finally, everything in this video is pretty much useless the second the first central bank buys it. It's not going to be a big country to start but it's going to happen. The state-level FOMO has not yet occured and it's getting closer day by day. 

Even J-Pow has said BTC is effectively gold just today. The narrative is shifting extremely fast."
5911,"I think you’re wrong on what will dump. In a market crash crypto won’t be going up as the stock market is dumping. They’re going to dump together (if they dump). It’s not like oh hey the market crashed 20, 30% and BTC will be going up 50%, and then Elon will go yeah let’s sell. At least that’s what I’ve seen and is my opinion."
5912,Omg them spammers are so annoying. Guys report them!!!
5913,Lets gooooo📉📉📉📉
5914,Thanks for being so woke
5915,"Aww boo hoo, people lost money in 2017? Not if they HELD ONTO THEIR BITCOIN. Take your small brain plays somewhere else..."
5916,🌈🐻
5917,"I don't believe this, bitcoin won't crash"
5918,"""Everything is hyptothetical.""

Super wrong lol.  THETA is a real product."
5919,Always love your videos. It’s always funny to see someone who’s totally normal who does this stuff. Haha
5920,"HODLING since map quest, limewire and silk road😁 and can say with a straight face institutional dump will be a big one💩"
5921,"*GOLD. You speak Truth.*

*Thank you.*"
5922,"""Crypto noob"" and not the top tier trader but probably outperforms them as well.

The adaptability and onservational skills on this dude are 10/10."
5923,"If what you are saying doesn't happen, it will be uncharacteristic of bitcoin.

Study the cycles. Until the cycle is broken, the pattern remains"
5924,"Becker as much as I respect you, I feel like you're wrong about this. Crypto is probably going to be fine. If anything, BTC is going to be recognized as the overpriced collectable it is. There are a lot of functioning products in crypto, but I feel like you are failing to make use of them. This is on you for getting too comfortable."
5925,"Sorry, disagree. What will crash the market is the sudden appearance of some of that missing BTC."
5926,"I like that you are a contrarian. It's a good game theory (or war games) exercise to strategize what may happen. Good to be prepared for the inevitable. Corrections happen... When, who knows...? Tesla also has other companies like Neurolink, SpaceX, drilling underground ""whatever""... He's going along with some plan. His buddies at PayPal are going crypto very soon. Everything is interconnected. Always good to have an exit strategy. Thanks for the heads-up... Flexibility is key."
5927,Or.... They could be realizing bitcoin is a better form of money and not sell.....
5928,"Bitcoin futures launched Dec 18th, 2017
Bitcoin crash began Dec 22nd, 2017"
5929,Love your videos ......but your talking about bitcoin from a traders point of view. Bitcoin is a store of value for 5/10 ...... years. Anything you trade on you will get wrecked eventually
5930,Can you show and explain your tattoos?
5931,Wow! Thank you for this point of view. Exactly what I was asking myself: Why isn t anybody saying this might happen? Loved it. Subscribed!
5932,Plot twist...it's not going to crash like it did in the past cycles like everyone expects.
5933,The bigger the pump... the bigger the dump. The Fed will have pumped a fresh $10Trillion into this wacked wrecked wrankled economy by the end of this into next yr. The ink is still wet on this weeks $1.9Trillion Monopoly money and they're prepping printers on aNOTHER $3Trillion package.. lol... omg. This dump gonna be a black hole .. bridge is out ahead.
5934,Pull before Tesla. Gotcha.
5935,Do you believe in bitcoin ? Then hodl.
5936,Charlie Lee didn’t miss the top last time. In fact he was selling all his Litecoin at the top while telling his users to HODL.
5937,Tesla's buy didn't instant-spike the price...the news hype did. Tesla bought at 33k. The hype pump was at 38k.
5938,Let them get rekt it part of the lessons  in crypto
5939,"Here shorting BTC l;aughing at n00bs.  Good, good."
5940,"This guy was reviewing soda drinks and other crap just months ago on his channel...geez, selling adds only, that's how he makes his money sheeple, better listen to him"
5941,F'n A you're spot on @Alex Becker's channel Thanks for this perspective. Get ur head out of the clouds and think like a savage businessman. Thanks dude
5942,We have to do something about the fake Alex Becker bot in the comments.
5943,Holy crap so many commercials...
5944,History would agree with you.
5945,Is Alex watching Impaulsive? Look at the background
5946,"Nice video, this makes a lot of sense
Thank for your insights, please keep uploading videos!"
5947,"Great Video. But now if we aren't looking for a hyperabiler, but what are we looking for? Stonk market crash? If not what? Maybe we will just go sideways for a year? seriously what are you looking for woke boss Alex. help this pleb"
5948,XRP !!
5949,"Cheers Alex, this is what the people need to hear!"
5950,I love you but you re wrong lol
5951,In 2013 there was a double bubble
5952,Alex you have been in crypto only a year and you are right about the crash coming.
5953,"So we’re do I put my money, is it a good idea to hedge with puts on Bitcoin"
5954,So.... would you buy heaps when it crashes? Or is Bitcoin done?
5955,diamond hands bro
5956,No outro? 😔
5957,You didnt like it 12 months ago and your keping your money in? Hahahah you sound ridiculous dude
5958,"Love the honesty you put into what your saying, never blowing smoke up us. Great video Alex!"
5959,"Ez. Pump the coin at the top. Then get afraid as it dips a little, and spread FUD. Then buy the dip."
5960,"Another great thought provoking information, Thank you Alex"
5961,Thank you for the insight man. good point.
5962,"If tesla sells, bitcoins will dip so hard, sooo hard, i'll be maybe able to buy a few whole bitcoins ... :)"
5963,No .they will take loans at low interest rates to buy their shares back....using BTC and tesler stock as collateral for financing....  btc and tester stock will likely act as very good investments against inflation...  and debasement.
5964,What are you talking about? Most of tesla sales are model 3 and now coming up numbers of model y. They are not luxury cars and reasonably priced. You are delusional
5965,Those who lost millions should've held and would've been at ATH
5966,"BTC most bearish quote is 300K within a year, this is nothing."
5967,josh lucas knows his stuff
5968,Btc is designed to crash ✌️plus I saw like 5 Becker videos with similar titles so that should be true 😁
5969,"Got rock solid diamond hands, not weak to sell just buy"
5970,"Companies don’t sell bitcoin, they Use it as collateral - they keep their bitcoin and pay their bills at the same time"
5971,Gas prices will go thru the roof I believe electric cars are going to have one of the best years especially many car companies are working on an effortible on this happens be greedy when other are fearful
5972,"Right now looks similar to where we were between mid-June & mid-July of 2017 when BTC took a 36% dump.  Once the markets figure out how they're gonna react to possible interest rate hikes, bond yields and other overblown narratives, it'll be fine.   Also I concur with this summer being the top.  Hope I'm wrong but ok if I'm right.  Stimulus helicopter money running out is gonna reveal we have bigger problems."
5973,"cool theory...but it's backed by nothing other than besides maybe a little use of ""common sense"" or brainstorming...Micheal Saylor...one of the largest investors other than Gray Scale explains his strategy and the reasoning behind it....he won't be dumping but will be holding on for 100 years to give to his children, as he explains it's pointless to move from an appreciating asset to a depreciating asset, that's all anyone is doing when they sell....these firms are long term thinkers...they don't play the market like how I can tell you do with your light-up keyboard,...I say that with respect....but you embody a  retail day-trading type persona who believes these CEOs think the same way you do."
5974,"I can't wait for Bitcoin to hit $20k, going all in then"
5975,"crypto crash is always good for big buy, you have no worries if you DCA. in the meantime, buy the cheap ETH. Ya'll also wanna take a look at UNI.

1 thing you can bet on, is the failure of USD and US stock market

Also 15:20 , you made me laugh. I havent laughed in a while, I will never unsub. maybe you don't realize it, but you are a financial advisor

And i agree about taking profit, why should we reinvest our profit? Missed the point of profit. Only invest with money you can afford to lose, not money you've won"
5976,Bitcoin huge dump 😢😢😢
5977,Never been a big fan of the share market system myself ...
5978,"Alex, you have no expertise in cryptocurrency or reading markets. Sit down."
5979,Clickbait nonsense.
5980,I'm heavily invested in both Bitcoin and Tesla...so...
5981,"of course a crash is coming, a it always come in shares and of course that most of projects will fail, but many projects are real like cardano and many will survive and be the next big thing. so the biggest trick is to choose the winners.. of course dont bet more than you can afford to lose, so be smart about. i dont think the next crash will be as bad as the last one, as there are many things that are different now. many products are there and have a real use even cardano is already being used in a real life scenarios. i belive cryptos and blockchain are here to stay and even efts as i have seen far worse ideas getting a foothold and lets face it this is a new thing and everyone is scared or sceptical and some are not, but with anything new this is always the case. look at the electric cars 20 years ago, or even the internet in 1980s or even early 1990s.."
5982,"Even if Corporations that are buying Bitcoin pull. The others will love it because the price will go down. 

Don’t forget Coinbase is going public next month. That should pump the markets. Oh and Cardano has a big update coming in the next 90 days. 

If the market dips, then I’ll be buying it."
5983,We are all lose money he is  right
5984,Lol all these people making videos with catchy names to get views. Lol. You don't know jack.
5985,"Just go to 7:27 to 7:40 of this video, invest comfortably in bitcoin, and know everything else is just noise."
5986,Fud
5987,17:50 - 18:20 i died of laughter
5988,"Alex, your perspective in all this is just Gold🌟👌🏻👍🏻"
5989,"Everybody has an opinion.....opinions don't count, you need evidence to back it up."
5990,If you're a HODLer then you'd be worried. If you're a trader you'll love the volatility and liquidity. Plenty of people make money when market crashes. In fact the biggest gainers in stock markets are usually shorters at the right time and condition.
5991,So how do you know the peak hasn’t already happened?
5992,"I tell a lot of my friends to not even bother getting into crypto when it's ""half way"" through a bull run. Wait until it's into another down cycle then fill your bags and hodl for 3-4 years for it to shoot up again then get out with tasty profits."
5993,I day trade now.. No more investing or hodling until after corrections..
5994,"yes, BTC crashes after every bull cycle. Its not happening tomorrow though."
5995,"As the big guys are selling, moon boys are dip buying which is great for smart $ as they need those liquidity to cash out."
5996,Thanks for a much needed dose of reality.
5997,This guy is such a deuce but 🤷‍♂️
5998,Then buy more tf
5999,If they arent dumb they sell to OTC market and never tell anyone.
6000,Why Tesla would trade BTC for the worlds biggest shizcoin USD doesnt make any sense. The USD is the only coin GUARANTEED to LOSE VALUE every year.
6001,">Economy crashed in 2020 and tesla stock went up
>Dollar is inflating, Chairman Powell admits Bitcoin is good rival to gold
>Countries in process of creating digital blockchain versions of their currency
>Real estate is in bubble + 3D printed houses will lower house values
>Scaramucci said SpaceX had even more BTC than Tesla ~$5 Bil

Why would Elon Musk dump all his BTC? What will probably happen is maybe there will be profit taking. They will not dump all their bitcoin"
6002,You make sense was thinking the same thing
6003,It's because of all of the stimulus mfs who don't know how the markets work the bulls will survive
6004,"Alex, whether you have an interest in bitcoin or not, the important thing is bitcoin has an interest in you. Any of your internet profits are losing money every day in the ""safety"" of bank cash. Welcome to Venezuala 2.0, because the Fed are comprised of Marxists dressed in Keynesian garb who refuse to follow the guide posts of the Austrian School of Economics. There is no where else to hide Alex, thanks to the loss of trust in govt. ""Misleaders"" , Marxist university professors, and degenerate Hollywood meat puppets aka ""actors."" The money tsunami from the Fed inflates away value every day. Your internet mkt. expertise that brings in millions will be useful when gas costs $10 a gallon and Dom Perignon $40,000 a bottle.

6005,I feel there are more to this market that we know. With proper guidance you are sure of investing wisely even with the complicated market. I’ve made so much bitcoins in my 8 months of investing with the help of Derrick Payne Trading. Things might get worse so make a smart move.
6006,Thanks again
6007,Everything you said is hypothetical man . Why you try n sound so confident ?
6008,Michael sailor won’t sell... he would go down with the ship. Elon probably won’t sell either
6009,I think Mr. Becker has some points.  But Bitcoin is digital gold.  And when the economy goes down.  Tax hikes and the other things happening.  People and companies will look for a hedge.  As they have done for years.  In the past. Forever.
6010,"Damn click bait bro , smh . All opinion . And just turned off thousands to Btc . Wow"
6011,Silly video
6012,"WTF would you even know?! If you'r info could be trusted you wouldn't be bothering making silly youtube videos, you'd be in wallstreet. They'd pay anyone who could predict the market accurately."
6013,No 🧢
6014,"So, you're Tesla, and your BTC bet is making you 4x more than your ENTIRE CAR COMPANY..... And your logic is to dump the golden goose, during a time when everything is tanking??
Tesla coin, baby!!!!"
6015,"BTC will be at $73,608 before the next big pullback. Only a small amount of shares will be taken at that price. Set your sells for $72,503. Around 3 months from today. You’re welcome."
6016,Only peasants sell when it drops. Sell off so I can buy more.
6017,I only smell fuds by this guy lol. Just last video he was like 'ima put my savings in crypto'.
6018,I love your poker game analogy. It’s every man for himself. Sad reality but it is what it is.
6019,"I think we've already seen the top, it has traded sideways for too long and is only being propped up by inflation fears and promises of stimulus checks buying in. Hedge funds are just making easy money off of naive Crypto people before they have to disclose their holdings in April. I mean it already hit 3 times the 2017 ATH, who in their right mind is  buying into it now instead of selling a 3x after bag holding for 4 years? Oh, and now we've got wales and derivatives to make the variance even more stupid, woo hoo."
6020,"Yeah, you re pretty much on point! I keep seeing '' This time it s different! '', and that tells me it s going to be at least just as bad as last time, and I m not missing the gains again, I will be one who pulls profits too early."
6021,Alex “paper hands” Becker. Suckers attempt to time and trade this. The investors who hold will win out in the decade to come
6022,the fundamental problem with bitcoin and all crypto currencies is that u can buy them and trade them
6023,Tesla isn’t gonna sell cause they barely invested anything from a company stand point.
6024,Thank you. This is what I have been thinking the whole time. Like it is worse than the tech bubble of ....  was it late 1990's? Same thing just too long ago for most reading this to remember.
6025,"How can an asset that you’re sure is going to 1.5m be undervalued at 50k? Seems unnecessarily risky to sell and try to buy back in (paying capital gains tax), rather than just hodling through it, unless you really need liquid capital right now."
6026,"You clicked baited me in but, you total changed my view. Im still bullish."
6027,I love it when people post such things when they see weakness. But never trade it never show their pnl Never show their trade history. And host lost me at 2:30
6028,"yeah just like everyone overlooked (or purposely failed to mention) back in sept 19 and march 2020, the shadow banking system just went negative again. that changed everything then, so why isnt it going to again? simple answer - it is.... question is how long from now?  took just over 5 months last time....."
6029,So we should buy more weed stocks for the crash. Because everyone will want to get high when they are broke as fuck 🤔
6030,Theta
6031,Thnx
6032,Best video
6033,bro tesla investors aren't their for his cars lol you are making the same mistake as the typical analyst I've been invested in tesla since 2016 solar city merger  there are a lot of things coming for Tesla he is making complete smart homes and most likely moving into HVAC as well big things are coming don't sell all your tesla shares or when it's 1500 a share you're gonna be pissed.
6034,I’m pretty sure that you could be sued for giving misleading info about Tesla ??
6035,"Says a guy who is more a BS artist than anything, who claimed this weekend that Disneyland is too small for him to work with, however, he works hard to be a youtube. LOL."
6036,You don’t know what you’re talking about 😂
6037,"good video, i dont want no opium"
6038,"If you didn't accumulate in the previous bear, then this is not your bull."
6039,Stick to you’re day job buddy and stop investing in crypto and you’ll stop getting burned
6040,"BTC and alt coins crashing after the summer is expected. 
people who have been into crypto for many years already know this. 
So your ""prediction"" is in line with the experts."
6041,"Here’s what’s real. Bitcoin is a better financial instrument than gold. Period.

Until 10T market cap, just hodl. Then do whatever you want.

No hodler lost money in the last bull market; unless they sold, they’ve at LEAST 3x’ed even if they bought in at the VERY top."
6042,"I get the thinking but I don't buy it. Sure a crypto correction can happen at any time but there's zero reason to believe it's going to be a long term thing and the real companies like Tesla (not just trade funds) who bought in will not liquidate easily.

Specifically - the organizations that bought BTC bought it as a hedge against the USD dropping - an inevitable eventuality that scares the hell out of them and rightfully so. They all know crypto's volatility and that's why they allocated a smaller % of their cash balance than they otherwise would as a strict investment. This means they're completely prepared to ride a few volatility rides without liquidating.

As to your scenario for a market crash. It depends a lot on the cause of the crash. The most likely cause is going to be inflation of costs (in terms of USD) and loss of value for the dollar. This scenario would drive crypto higher than ever so organizations holding crypto will only liquidate to the extent necessary to satisfy operational expenses. Institutions that pull out as soon as they experience a correction will be shown as idiots and speculators rather than informed responsible investors. They were conservative to get in and they'll be conservative to get out.

Definitely there's plenty of hype that those people who piled on will run quickly. But I suspect you'll see the institutions buy into the dip and drive it up higher not unlike March of last year."
6043,"Click bait, good point though, most people miss the bottom and the top is how it seems. making the best out of it is the skill. I like what you have to say in these. All the best Alex and thank you. I think you should think about doing some interviews not a lot of them just I tend to think you would ask some really pertinent questions and make it fun one on one."
6044,"Makes multiple videos on BTC crashing, so he can scare people into dumping, so he can THEN buy BTC at a lower price. Smart!"
6045,Nice clickbait
6046,Thanks for being the voice of reason here!
6047,"when did Tesla or amazon start paying dividends? this guy has no idea what he's talking about he's just here for clicks so he can make a bit of money from YouTube. Most these big institutions won't sell btc, they are looking out 10 plus years and bitcoin is the future! good luck to anyone who follows this clown"
6048,"If Musk would really sell his BTC I think he would be a real laughing stock in the world.
Like, omg, Musk has such weak hands, can't even hold on BTC even while he is among the richest people.
Are your TESLA cars also that weak? Better look at other brands with strong hands."
6049,the honesty and non moonboy narrative is refreshing
6050,That's right
6051,So. U use tesla selling as clickbait but then say that u dont actually think tesla will sell? Dude u need a better job. Ur a joke
6052,You silly goose
6053,I know ppl who held past the 2017 crash and they aren’t selling. The lesson is hodl.
6054,"This is like early 2017, while to go yet.
Volume is a great indicator of larger changes of direction."
6055,Amazon is trash 🗑 this guy is always wrong 😑
6056,ADA has a working product... Lmfaooo
6057,your youtube ad came on as a midway roll during this and it tripped me the fuck out lol it transitioned so well I thought you just burst into spontaneous ad mode.
6058,"There is a huge number of CME gaps that need to filled down to 9500 and should be filled , this would re-build the working trust with them having  very professional scale dump and Elon selling to help."
6059,Great thanks
6060,Buy the dodge
6061,"A couple of days ago .
Everyone: buy more, buy more . To the moon, is WIFE changing money 😂 
Yes , your wife’s will leave you because your broke soon🤦🏻‍♂️. Just kidding 😂 she’s loyal."
6062,"If Elon is selling his bitcoin.
Then don't buy some Tesla :)"
6063,Institutional money flow will prevent a deep market crush as it used to in cryptos.
6064,I've been seeing your videos recommended but just hate your titles. So full of hype and clickbait it's disgusting
6065,"Bitcoin is an inflation bet.   We are already getting talk about another round of stimulus checks and if the stock market does crash, there is an expectation that there will be monetary and fiscal stimulus to counter the move.  There will be corrections but I don't see a crash."
6066,who gives a fuck about Elon?  Bitcoin is way bigger and powerful than him
6067,If he had a cup of coffee he'd get to the point
6068,"I love your videos but one minute your saying everyone is going to wrecked yet then you saying will go to $1.5m+ lol, moral of the story don't panic sell, either get out earlyish at a reasonable profit or if you miss the drop gotta hold"
6069,bro lookin lean
6070,"I love the videos and you are sometimes  a little all over the place but this one has a many holes it it and the logic it riddled with problems. Like cryptos have no product? VeChain, OMI etc... just to start"
6071,Appreciate the realistic opinion. My ass stays smoke free on your channel Alex.
6072,Alex killing the bull market vibes.
6073,"17:30
It's not IF they pull its WHEN"
6074,"The voice of reason, he’s right"
6075,Crash happens  April 14 get out by April 10. Seriously. Next buy in date afterward is June 25/26. It's on a long running cycle. This is a fact. There is one more move #5 in a TA analysis. Then resets itself for a new cycle to re-enter in June
6076,Betting your wrong!!!     I want thru crash ....understand it took several months to crash !!!
6077,When the stock market crashes the bears will be buying Tesla’s and crypto folks don’t buy Tesla’s cause why would you sell a bitcoin for a car? Hodl
6078,saylor is NEVER pulling. have you watched his interviews lol
6079,Nice to see this in contrast to most of the 100x shills.
6080,dont get fooled... alex is baiting yall to panic sell ur bitcoins so he could scoop it up at 17k
6081,"Thanks Mr - ""be more pessimistic"" is certainly a good advie to protect your capital."
6082,"For someone that’s new to Crypto in relative terms, you have a phenomenal insight and are able to break down complicated macro trends into easy to understand explanations. Thank you Alex."
6083,This is the first video I've watched from you and I'm SO happy to see you be so honest. Social media and the Internet in general can be such an echochamber sometimes and we get biased. Thank you!
6084,"Michael Saylor has been dollar cost averaging for months now even over $50k, if he were to sell all he wouldn't still be buying more."
6085,not clickbait..
6086,Facts
6087,For every 1 institution that sells 2 are going to be buying in.
6088,Wow!! you open my mind. Thank you Mr Becker.
6089,"The real issue here is not bitcoin but gold and its price of $1700 per ounce.  An 11 trillion market cap of gold gives only a price of $1700 and a digital equivalent of gold, bitcoin, with a trillion market cap gives you a $55000 price.   Once hodlers of gold realize the obvious manipulation here and want an asset that cannot be manipulated, that is when we will see bitcoin moon even higher"
6090,"For me, I'm gonna buy the dips thank you for providing useful information as always :D"
6091,"I want to buy Hyros merch, is there any way I could ?"
6092,"This guy simply doesnt know what he's talking about.. LOL 
(1) Cardano has plenty of ""working products"" on its ecosystem and it itself is a ""working product"" 🤦🤦 That also goes for Bitcoin.. 
(2) Tesla adds Bitcoin to it's portfolio is an ""impairment cost."" If you actually knew what you're talking about you would know this... You sound beyond misinformed. 
(3) You clearly don't about blockchain, coding, or crypto... LOL You just chase value and think you do... Go do some real research."
6093,Peter Schiff 2.0 in the making?
6094,And this is why I don't hold btc and only hold altcoins that are bringing cefi to defi
6095,"This video will extend the bull run. Much needed reality check. Thanks, Alex!"
6096,5 adds in a 20 minute video? I thought you were Mr. money bags. why so many adds? 💰😂
6097,"stocks will crash, crypto will crash but crypto will recover quicker."
6098,You’re not accounting for the fact that Tesla gets to write off their losses the year they occur but don’t have to pay taxes on profits until they sell into cash. There is some incentive to not sell. This applies to all companies that put crypto on their balance sheet. Incentive is greater if their business is in massive profits like Tesla is.
6099,This guy got ptsd from 2018 crash lol you can feel it in his face
6100,Yeah right
6101,like your grand parents coming over for thanksgiving yoooooooooo hahahaha
6102,Hodlers going to get rekt
6103,Dude. Yes means no?
6104,Alex low key doing JRNY reaction vids one hour later
6105,You should give a speech to all those billionaire that are investing in BTC they would pay you well to make save them money.
6106,Ripple using XRP with real utility!
6107,"You really think it's going to take all summer to show a meaningful drop?  Not sure how you came to that realization.  I would think you would look to the housing market for signs or an omen of things to come.  The housing market is so much more traditional in predicting market crashes than crypto could ever hope to be.  Obviously, this is only my opinion and my opinion alone.  Just a different way of looking into the crystal ball lol."
6108,"Look we get it, but you are utterly overlooking the actual fundamental use value of btc and eth. This isn't a game of musical chairs. The intrinsic value of both is measureable. Bit hey, good luck."
6109,I think Elon bought in predominantly to sell off n weather the oncoming storm as many others
6110,Lol do you think nfts dip before or after that
6111,What to invest in once it crashes?
6112,It’s a way to get away from crashing currency the dollar is a far worse storm then crypto storm.
6113,Yes ! It needed to be said 😀 lots of noobs going to get crushed on this. Thank you Mr Becker
6114,I’m super bullish on btc and crypto in general but damn you bring up some good points!
6115,I think the only problem is you’re assuming institutions will take profits rather than continue to accumulate more.
6116,Ok HODL through the storm 💎 🙌🏼
6117,Dope! 👊🏽
6118,Been in crypto since March lol
6119,"Share crash April, everything's getting cashed out 😁"

6128,"I dumped my Bitcoin, I'm all in on Harmony One and Celer"
6129,Hmm.. so how do we see the end of this bull market coming ? When the economy crashes ? When institutions start selling ? How will we know ? I'm a beginner :)
6130,Damm it why not Michael selling
6131,"If tesla sells bitcoin, guess what coin they're gonna buy instead... To the moon!"

6134,"Bitcoin winter is coming. Either sell before the bubble market crash or diamond hands HODL. I agree that's the only way to profit. Buy low, sell high."
6135,"Thank you, I really appreciated your perspective"
6136,ITS TIME TO BUY THE DIP! BTC is the future.
6137,Should I buy bitcoin right now yes or no
6138,saylor will not sell as he is not even 2X now.
6139,"Love your videos and mindset 
For once a straight shooter. 
No beating around the bush
And Bs.
Respect Alex keep does video's coming.🙏🙂"
6140,"Fed is going to keep printing to push the crash far past this crypto bull market. Retail crypto holders are going to sell during the holidays thinking the bull market is over. ""See ya again in four years."" A couple months later the institutions are going to buy up the coins of the most successful projects and extend the bull market another year while pricing out retail who sold off. The top will occur in Fall of '22 when most altcoins will have crashed without recovery. Retail will have to buy back less of the best projects at a premium during the bear market (2023-2025). Institutions will end up with more and retailers with less."
6141,he will buy more🤣
6142,If it crash’s then I’ll buy as much as I can!!
6143,Should I ask myself how many weeks are left?
6144,"Thanks man, lots of people needs to hear this! Don’t be greedy, take some profits! Sometimes it’s easy holding in hopes for more profit, but they end up sitting with empty hands."
6145,I'm only at 4x now. I will start to be super careful on the next run up. I feel OK right now tho. And I am in long term stuff that I would hold if it comes down... SHR VET... My other stuff I will start selling any big pumps. And bank enough fiat to survive the next bear
6146,"'we are just betting on whats going to happen"" is the best line, to many people out here thinking its gunna change the world withing two years"
6147,Theta!
6148,We are investing in the new internet. It’s been around for 10+ years
6149,Do you have source with Tesla selling? Or is this just fud coming from a guy who constantly reminds us he'll dump on us?
6150,"The US government won’t let bitcoin be the main currency. They will lose their power and control if it continues. Today they announced that mining Bitcoin is causing global emissions. Whether this is true or not, the US is on a mission for zero emissions and Gates behind all of this. Hints why Gates and Buffet are against Bitcoin, they know the federal reserve is going to create their own. Creating their own will allow them to have the first blocks insuring their power and control. As of right now, Japan and China have the first blocks of Bitcoin which will put them as dominant leaders. The US government won’t let that happen. Don’t get me wrong tho, there is still opportunities to earn money buying and selling cryptos as of right now, but eventually lawmakers will put an end to most of this."
6151,Wow best video ever heard.
6152,So cryptoart is gonna crash as well?
6153,"You forget that there is 100 trillion in bonds with a negative return and that the fed will keep printing (they do not have a option) this time is different, not because of the institution, the macro enviroment is TOTALLY DIFFERENT"
6154,Alex you are the DeadMau5 of finances
6155,you forgetting money flowing out of ETFs into BTC
6156,"Although it is a possible scenario, there are a lot of ""ifs"" and ""buts"" for that to play out. If it were to play out that way it would take a while for a drop in cars sales to reflect in Tesla profits, and so could be end of 2021 or 2022 before they would sell BTC....IMO. 😁"
6157,Great critical thinking and analysis. This is almost exactly what’s going to happen. It’s all about the $$$ and human behavior is extremely predictable. 🔒 in profits!
6158,Sure seems to me like whales are taking profit and pushing the price low in correlation with the fed chairman's comments..but who knows..
6159,You’re right about everyone seeing the same charts.  Whales have the instant data  via bot. The only unknown  is the eth cme’s  . You’ve got the means - Find out if the 51% miner Narrative is legit or Hegelian dialectic?
6160,"This isn’t the first time major institutions have jumped in. This is just the first time they’ve been public about it. What if Musk is holding onto another big news drop when that bearish winter starts setting in? What if SeeTee raises even more capitol for it’s shareholders by building incredible new projects in the clean energy sector, funded entirely by Bitcoin? What if Microstrategy decides to defend the network buy pumping even more when the market starts to cool? There’s no evidence at all that Michael Sailor will liquidate. That would be the ultimate fuck you to the entire community and it doesn’t seem plausible, but of course, anything is possible. About as unlikely though as unscrambling an egg. 
I would bet that this year can’t be equated to past bull markets like 2017 because it follows some major changes in the financial markets. No one was talking about the m1 money supply issues and how worthless the US dollar was about to become in 2017 following a global health crisis and government UBI. The crypto market was much more based on over evaluation than I believe it is today. I think there’s been a changing of the guard. 
Also, on side note, I would bet that Elon Musk personally owns BTC as well as Space X, it’s just not public."
6161,"this is so true. Once bitcoin reach 100k, every institutions who purchased bitcoin will sell and run away with loads of money in their pockets."
6162,"Are you Satoshi Nakamoto? Cuz every time you make a video about stuff crashing, it does... make one about ETH going to the moon or something lol"
6163,Mmm... thank you for the great video
6164,Bro you've made the same video every day for the past 3 weeks
6165,Bitcoin is a ticking bomb right now. Its just matter of time before it goes to like 20k
6166,Any source Tesla selling their BTC for just 5% drop ?
6167,8:43 TLDW: he dosen't know if tesla will sell. basically clickbait title.
6168,😧 i care about the earth
6169,It's almost annoying how smart you are. You remind me of . . . me.
6170,"Thanks for the reality check... Love you man, love your content."
6171,nah. IMHO tesla is not selling this early.
6172,Love the point of view. Couldn't agree more
6173,Absolutely love your honesty!  It is a dog eat dog world!
6174,"Solid analysis Alex. All cryto is is a game of chicken. Or poker. Every transaction is not fair - the buyer and the seller is trying to screw each other. 

Sure the technology is good. Sure it has utility. But like any currency - money is made on the margin. Some will win. Some will lose. Everyone is trying to screw each other. 

My take - be the honest guy. The honest guy will make money long. He just has to be patient."
6175,A crash income? Guess I better start selling so the likes of Alex or Elon can buy cheap BTC!
6176,Operation cash dump
6177,Crypto is not the stock market. Also the world is overvalued while crypto is not overvalued.
6178,"Tesla won't sell. They can write off the losses even if they HODL. They'd be crazy to sell. Legit point as always tho, apart from the Tesla argument. (Coming for a guy who spent 100+ hours researching about Tesla stuff - one of my biggest holding with great profits)"
6179,"Look up Michael Sailor, he has the antithesis view of this"
6180,"Newsflash:
*tesla is not selling btc*



Title is total click bait"
6181,It’s undervalued. Not overvalued. What a newb.
6182,Thanks for keeping it real. The attention on the topic is definitely important to keep in mind.
6183,"5 stars, man!"
6184,I like this crypto channel
6185,"Crypto currencies aren't investments because they can't pay owners income. People don't understand what they are buying. 

Amazon, and Tesla, are also not investments for the same reason. Although they may become investments if they change their dividend policy."
6186,I feel there are more to this mar ket than we know. Ask for a proper guidance before  inv esting in this pretty much complicated mar ket.

6187,Don’t be a silly goose
6188,Why are we talking about how crypto is gonna crash all the way down whenever they go down 5%. This is very normal in this market. Get used to it already
6189,"im part of the 1% that pulled out at the top in 2017. listen... buy nano. its $5 now, but you're gonna be going off the walls once its worth > $1000 next year. its a long play, but its THE long play. dont take your profits from alts and slam into eth and btc. take your profits and slam into NANO for 250+x its strong enough to hold through a bear market and has potential to blast off in the next bull. save this comment now. thank me later."
6190,I doubt it
6191,Content has literally just gotten better and better and better.  Keep fighting the good fight Alex.  We love you for it
6192,this video is exactly why i hate the new term Diamond Hands they give a shit about us. Im a hustler ive been Holding since 17 because i missed the top figured it would rebound here is the rebound wall street hates us all. Don't fall for the narrative!
6193,Peculiar persons will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin  as it’s retracing... be wise
6194,I appreciate this video! always great to have a word of cautious awareness when we're dealing with a substance so volatile.
6195,Thank you for your honesty 🙏
6196,I think what will hurt BTC is energy consumption...
6197,Michael Saylor is hodling.
6198,Good to hear some counter arguments. And thanks for helping us to prepare.
6199,"It's funny how high the bitcoiners are getting. One guy looks like he's jerking off while talking about his btc on his youtube channel. 
Jp morgan is wanting to set btc as a asset class. One thing bothers me about btc. Banks are not buying btc. They are buying gold."
6200,"Genuinely a great video, I'm starting to respect and like you more and more each video, my opinion doesn't matter but the value you provide to others does. Thank you"
6201,"Aloha Brada Alex

6202,he underestimated one important factor... GREED...
6203,I can't wait for a crash. Get em on discount boyyy
6204,What if everyone is planning to buy bitcoin on the bottom and are thinking like you. lol
6205,I liked the video but I down vote clickbait.  There is no news of tesla selling.
6206,"Alex Becker, you can love him or hate em but he does make some solid points. Nice video"
6207,Wow I don't feel so bad taking my profits Great info thank you.....
6208,Thanks for the reminder to stay diligent and take profits!
6209,Love this analysis.
6210,Solid. Good perspective on why the institutions have been buying in to bitcoin
6211,Very important video.
6212,Click bait
6213,Alex knows how to make a title! The (Tesla selling) got me! Great video tho 👌🏻
6214,"He is right about one thing, it aint gonna crash in a way that everybody is expecting it to."
6215,"Once again; wisdom beyond your years.  I was thinking get in and hold, but you're right, this could be a long slow death like last time... Go on, take the money and run...  a-oo-guh"

I see one youtuber after another all looking at the same historical charts and the same unrealized profit charts, yadda, yaddah, all pretty much repeating the same exact ""analysis"" and I'm thinking ""wow, we're all so much ahead of the curve with this 'insider' information that all the professional traders and whales don't have...we'll be rich and all the big players will lose their money because they don't listen to my preferred youtubers!"" (rolling eyes)"
6225,Even if this is like the 2013 bull run with a mini bear market inbetween an it drops from 90k to 40k then waits few months before pushing back up towards 200k... Nobody cares I'll just buy more.
6226,"Of course it's gonna crash , the real whales, Wallstreet, the central banks comming in, what is there digital financial outcome its not hidden its in plain sight iso20022 . You got xrp, xlm, xdc,algo,iota , and more all powerhouses and faster,scalability,  efficiency,  interoperability, xrp will be the new king like it or not but it's like comparing sears to Amazon. Amazon wins. Why? You know it's better, tech wins"
6227,You guys are causing this by making YouTube videos like this..
6228,Tesla doesn't pay dividends lol
6229,Yep.....
6230,"If bitcoin went up in the long run theoretically there do not need to be losers. Yes people need to pay a higher price but in this hypothetical they would not have lost anything. Nobody had to lose for TSLA stock to get where it is. Markets can grow, in which case they are not 0 sum."
6231,Becker trying to hurry up and crash the market so he can buy in cheap again LOL
6232,I can see this being very possible ....
6233,you are the real down to earth man
6234,This is the church of Becker
6235,"Bring on the crash. It makes it easier for average folks like me to get in on the top high cost coins like ETH, MKR, BCH etc."
6236,"""I'm a rookie in the crypto space"" *proceeds to title videos like he knows what he's talking about in order to get views*"
6237,Tesla is not just an EV company. Your argument was biased
6238,I will buy as much as I can at the end of the bear cycle
6239,"All i'm waiting for is the Alex Becker video title of ""GET OUT OF BITCOIN NOW!!!"""
6240,This is laughable
6241,"yeah, you are full of shit on this one. electrification of cars isn't a fashion trend for the super rich, there's real economic and environmental values to be gained by switching over. and the thing is china is a bigger electric car market than the rest of the world combine, and china has made strides in cleaning up the air pollution by switching over to electric buses, taxies, and cars in general. you are just making up shit as you go on this one"
6242,The only time you gain or lose dollar wise is when you sell.
6243,"Be careful with the titles, people's health is at stake here! 😂😂😂"
6244,Where’s the best place to buy Bitcoin and where’s the best wallet to keep it ?
6245,bitcoin never over value you need more education ....

6247,"I always say, I expect and predict the worst and if it doesn't happen then I'm pleasantly surprised..."
6248,Just put your bitcoin in a hardware wallet and forget about it for the next 10 years. That is the safest way to increase your wealth. Don't try to time the market and lose your sats. The 4 year cycle think may not even be valid anymore.
6249,"the big institutions have been buying all the time, whilst saying ""Bitcoin is useless, blah blah..."""
6250,Stop being so negative. Your a rookie
6251,Sailor will not pull. You haven't listened to him recently.
6252,you click baity bastard haha sounds like it’s gonna crash tomorrow by your title. I like your vids though

6256,"I bought at 10 grand, and have a stop limit at 49 grand...not really sweatin it. btc's earned it's right to take a dip now and then"
6257,Alex you have become a great entertainer like Mr. Graham Stephen Graham.
6258,I'm disliking this so other traders don't get this info :   )
6259,This sounds like truth to me
6260,Hey Alex can you do a video on what happens to the art coins like ADA once BTC crashes? So they tank along with them but then go parabolic?
6261,Nice work 🎇✨🌠
6262,"The Richest man again Jeff Bezus invested in $NCASH to become Amazon , Ebay and Alibaba Currency for Ecommcers!!! Very cheap coin! 15M MARKETCAP? WOW"

6265,Ads ads ads ads
6266,Only bitcoin. nothing else better crash
6267,"don't listen to Alex about this.  you may take profits in the short term, but if you want to get back in you're going to have to pay more. a lot more.  Alex is speaking like a trader, and bitcoiners are investors.  there is a difference.  unless you know what you're doing, do not sell your bitcoin.  if you do, you're going to be sorry as most investments are fiat instruments, and if when inflation starts to accelerate, you're going to be caught holding the bag, and i'm not talking about bitcoin or any other hard assets.  at that time, a lot of people are going to get destroyed.  don't sell any assets at this time unless you know what you're doing.  and the hardest asset at this time and in history, is bitcoin.......out with the bad money and in with the good....and it's going to be bitcoin."
6268,If it falls im buying
6269,"Never underestimate the hopium of the crypto investor. Even if all cryptos hit a 50% correction and stayed down for months, it would come back with an even crazier bull run. Almost everything is a speculative asset now anyways in our world of out of control central banks!"
6270,"Everyone’s a genius in a bull market, right?"
6271,"Yeah, you have to be realistic that's for sure."
6272,"Thanks for your vids Alex, I appreciate your perspective

edit: WOW! Alex Becker's Channel replied to me TWICE!!!! I'll be sure to contact both of them for the free millions in profit in crypto they promise! hahahah..."
6273,Theta has a working product as a streaming service with big companies invested.
6274,"A co worker of mine bought BTC in the last run @ 16k-ish and held for the 2-3-ish years of down to 4k... Late 2020 he sold and I told him ""dont do it. Not yet"" I have no idea his loss and the #'s here are guesses. I think BTC was around 9k. Now he wont even talk Crypos with me and emphasizes the point by saying dont even bring it up. 😂 If he wasnt a douchbag, I'd feel bad for him. So I just laugh instead. Lol. Best of luck everyone win or lose!!! 🤑"
6275,why not keep your coins and borrow against your btc?
6276,"I like Alex and many times he is spot on..this is not one of them. He does not understand Bitcoin on a technical level or in depth, he even admitted. Anyone buying Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme or to sell at top this year just doesn’t understand Bitcoin. If people don’t understand or get it, I’m sorry but I and many people who do, don’t have the time to convince them. Do your research before you sell the most scarce asset in history of the world."
6277,So basically Elon is going to be laying a HUGE dump on all the hodlers on top of that selling a few cars to a few of them on the way  xD
6278,"Of course it crashes, very normal"
6279,Grayscale and Microstrategy not selling lolz FUD but knowledge lol
6280,I was thinking the same thing. Real killer whales in our pool... love your channel brotha alex
6281,I've watched so many YouTubers on this topic and this is the first time I've heard anything that actually makes any sense.
6282,I think people staking and validating the network is what makes ada so strong....wouldn’t say it’s not worth what it’s worth but hell what do I know? Lol
6283,"Tesla is not selling
And bitcoin will exceed everyone's expectations this year and the next. 
Btc is the best performing asset ever  period. 
FUD is all he promotes."
6284,Yeah you’re 100 percent correct but even I know this and I barely started paying attention to crypto but as far as Tesla goes I’m not sure you understand Elon the man he’s not concerned with profits as long as his company’s can continue making shit better for the world fuck the investors invest in Elon I’m not even sure anyone realizes how much that one man alone is changing our world and there’s a huge shift change coming to the culture of humanity and I believe it’s coming through what he’s creating alone well through his company’s.
6285,"I actually had this similar thought several days ago. Virtually everyone I listen to is predicting crazy gains in btc till the end of the year. How many times has bitcoin done what it was supposed to do when almost all youtube 'experts' were predicting it to act a certain way. No. When there's mass consensus, it seems like btc always does precisely opposite what its supposed to."
6286,"Go down with the ship?

Elon runs an extremely long term business. TESLA is years away from full success. Why would he be short term on crypto? Especially with its potential?"
6287,"I appreciate this viewpoint. Although, I hate paying taxes. I’ll just hodl and buy more."
6288,Degenerate crypto Chad high APY yield farm chaser
6289,"Fuck you’re right. As soon as big firms start coming in and start seeing stock-market-level impressive gains, start DCAvging out."
6290,Clickbait crap title. And musk selling will have no effect. He doesn't have enough. Bitcoin is crap for gains unless you bought last March (2020) or before 2017.
6291,Totally agree I just sold down on all my stocks and coins next. Commodities ✅
6292,Look! This bull run right now is a speculative bull run ! The utility bull run has yet to come! When bitcoin pulls back ! That’s when the good projects rise. Bitcoin is being pumped.
6293,Shave.
6294,where are the WSB rtards? =D
6295,Were not in this together just here at the same time.
6296,"Thanks Alex great video. I sold all of my BTC at 59/60k, waiting for the dip then I will stock up again and HODL"
6297,A bird in the hand is better than two in a bush.
6298,☺️☺️☺️you super believe in technology Realy?? Looks more like you believe in tondumping on people and getting rich ... and every one here is like that .... don’t sell me that .. no one cares about technology.. they just want to be in the boat and get rich...
6299,"Agree somewhat, but I thought Tesla was going to zero during Covid times when the economy was zero and people were standing in food lines and yet somehow every other new car on the road is a Tesla.  Made me realize people with money will always have money and be able to buy their toys regardless of the stock market.   Also, BTC is not decoupled from the stock market.  If the market crashes, BTC aint going to be mooning. We’d be lucky it trends sideways.  And yeah if Tesla ever announced they were dumping BTC it would drop the price ridiculously fast.  We better hope that doesn’t happen.  🙏🙂"
6300,"Incorrect statement number 1 - everything is theoretical at this point... Absolutely no, etherium has clear applications just has a huge drawback, its gas fees. Also, a number of cryptos have real world applications already. Theta for example (my favorite) is already used by Samsung dude.

Come on, you are investing, you should know these things."
6301,Michael saylor will not be selling
6302,im holding since 200 eth. im not selling shiznit
6303,"thank you handsome minimalist man for honest opinions, even tho they may be not so popular"
6304,If it goes down hard that means it time to buy when it's low.  It will go back up again.
6305,I NEEDED THIS!!
6306,You a hunned percent
6307,Hey cutie pituty
6308,There will be a crash. But not massive like 2017. Not for at least a couple of months due to what's happening.
6309,Thumbnail intensifies 👀
6310,really interesting take man... thanks
6311,Haters will hate when the truth hits their faces.. 😵😵😵
6312,"Alex your ""hubris"" can only take you so far 😁"
6313,"You lost me when you said people will stop buying EVs, that’s the future bro."
6314,Your support and encouragement has been the driving factors of my life since yuh said it in your video thanks @Dao_hack on Telegram for the BTC
6315,"Since you believe it's a big crash, sell it short."
6316,"I have another possible scenario, everybody thinks when bitcoin crashes all the alts will moon, how about this, all the alts crash and bitcoin moons leaving everyone scrambling for bitcoin....forever"
6317,If I was the banks I would want to take everyone money too. I don’t blame them
6318,thanks for looking out for us bub
6319,"Hey Michael! Thank you for sharing your perspective! This must absolutely be considered! To be blindly riding the hype wave is indeed a risky trip to get high on. I appreciate your presenting business perspective, which is difficult to comprehend, when you are not in it yourselves.  I wonder, do actually see bitcoin as a hedge at all as we are heading more and more into inflation? 
Would you say, that institutional money would be better of in fiat currency in  this shaky economy? In other words, would it not be equally risky to sit on puffed up inflated paper money, that is not backed up by a thing and appears to be practically fake? Would Elon Musk make such a move, that apears to be risky on a very different premise? I would love to hear your thoughts! Thank you much."
6320,"Why does it feel like everything is over valued and heading towards a devistating crash right now. Crypto, stocks, property, humans, all in line for serious values corrections. When the whole planet crashes hard, people will still need food. Sell crypto and buy seeds and a weapon like the elites are doing."
6321,Keep an eye on Charlie Lee
6322,G analysis Alex.
6323,only weak hands lose their money
6324,"exactly what im thinking, bitcoin now is already in a hard resistance area, 60k, greyscale saylor is educating people to buy and hold, but what about him? i dont see greyscale purchasing a substantial amount since btc passed 47k, greyscale did not scoop up much coin when btc is down 26 percent, so the signal is very clear, a dip to 47k or 38k is possible, and then we can see it make its way to 100k, and i think these big bags are gonna pull at 70k - 80k zone depending on the momentum and since everyone is expecting 100k, they won't be betting billions on that mark."
6325,"Hey Alex, huge fan and been getting into trading w/ the stock market and crypto. Crypto coins seem to function very similarly to stocks in the sense of trends, valuations etc just higher risk higher reward. Do you think there will be some kind of restriction or implication on trading crypto like the stock market has, where people can only trade from Monday-Friday during business hours?"

6331,What can I buy for $10? 😂
6332,Change your title its very miss leading tesla is not selling their bitcoin there is no news they are selling.
6333,Agree. The great institutions are using btc as a trading tool not as a perpetual reserve asset.
6334,Alex looking bulky 💪
6335,"When you sell bitcoin, you're not just selling bitcoin, you're buying dollars. You know dollars? Those things we just printed 6 trillion of? 6 times all the money in btc, we printed that this year. If you think dollars are more valuable than btc at any point, then you're absolutely right you should sell."
6336,I knows this was gonna happen like 5 years ago...
6337,Alex I emailed you but I haven't heard back I want to build a game production company I would like to work with you don't worry I will not disturb I just need fund I will get it work. getting start up is impossible this times
6338,"Be careful with alt's, Bitcoin might go down 85% in a crash but alt's go down over 99%."
6339,ADA to the MOOOON    HODL for ever
6340,"I mostly agree with this, however the total market cap of BTC is over 1 trillion LOL Tesla pulling isn't gonna be more than a scratch... nobody moves BTC at this point... the crash is gonna be crazy though, I agree with that"
6341,"Thank you for keeping it real bro. Even like you said, you told us not to buy things cuz it pumps you would sell it. I keep saying to my friends, if these institutions will buy in a dip, they will sell in a profit. I was a bs major after my service,  and couldn't cut it cuz these business people would do things best for the short term vs. the long term (much worse than the military); and I couldn't understand why. But in the end it will always be a dog eat dog world, that's how it is. At least thanks for not shilling and telling us the straight truth."
6342,Are they gonna at least send out a robo call?
6343,This resonates with those who rode the last bull run up and down... unpleasant is the word.
6344,"I know what you mean, but as long as you are hard into bitcoin and hodl, you will be ok...if everyone sells bitcoin, all that will happen is the elite will buy it all up, and then the normal people will never get it again.  I truly believe nft's are a distraction to take crypto minded people eyes off bitcoin, all that matters is bitcoin, everything else is a gamble or distraction IMHO"
6345,Thanks for time and videos.
6346,Alex I bet you 100k Elon does not sell all his bitcoin
6347,"Harsh, but you're 100% right. No one does care about the average person. If they can line their pocket that's all they care about. Congrats on your gains. Hopefully I can make some crazy money soon. I need a break. I don't have the capital to make the profits people with deep pockets have. Feel free to shoot me a sleeper. Haha"
6348,Dollar cost  average for the next 3 years  into the next Halving you wont regret it. If you sell you create a capital gains tax. The dollar is loosing purchasing power and your Bitcoin for the past 10 years  had an average  return of 200% per year. What did your Fiat earn from your friendly Banker ?
6349,"Thanks for the updates. I agree with all your points, nobody knows where B TC will go, Surely I wouldn’t invest in it as a retirement asset, I don’t think it will ever replace fiat (Both because of its limited availability also because it would take generations to do that)and most of all because now at (almost) All-time highs is in my opinion not the best moment to enter.
Nevertheless I’m happy I enter sometime ago and I’m holding. None has a crystal ball but in my humble opinion, most people just take about B TC, which is just the tips of the iceberg, I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn’t mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. I advice that we all follow a less talked about way which is trad!ng. I was about to generate more than 15B TC with 1. 4 B TC in an interval of 6 weeks from using the tradё signal of Prof Ryan jackson on Tel egram {Ryantrading5501}  for more insights"
6350,chainlink (enjoyed the video good perspective)
6351,Church of Bitcoin 🙏🏻😂👌🏼
6352,Love this duds honesty.
6353,Here’s to hoping it crashes to 3k so I can buy buy buy
6354,Tesla won’t sell their Bitcoin!  If they lose money it’s a tax write off. There are articles about it
6355,"I honestly agree, buying certain alt coins for now but will be ready to buy Bitcoin if it drops.  Maybe I can get 1! :)"
6356,Awesome video Alex 🤘 your the best . I love your explanations . Had exactly the same thoughts on the theme and people wouldn't even consider that opinion.  People are like crazy with bitcoin right now ...
6357,"I think you're absolutely wrong
You said it, you've been in Bitcoin since March, you're a newbie

You only lose if you sell, look at the chart, you could have bought at any point and you're doing pretty well.

Trying to time bottoms and tops is for losers, it's stressful and it will get you a tax bill.
HODL forever"
6358,You're missing a piece to the puzzle.
6359,Controversy sells
6360,"HBAR superior tech, already in real world application. Bitcoin is grandma's home video vhs tape collection."
6361,"Do you think we will know when Tesla sells? Maybe too late then, you absolutely right just keep eye on the market and pullback as soon as you can. Thanks for making the truth transparent 🙏🙌🏼"
6362,I've been in crypto for a very long time now. I told alot of people to get in last year noone listened. For the last month everyone and there mother is asking me what to buy i tell them all you missed it Do Not Buy. Wait for a huge pull back if you really want to buy
6363,Alex is becoming the biggest troll on the internet lol 😆
6364,leverage trading my man! IDC if she goes to 10k. Just make more gains.
6365,Well Said.. Everyone thinks they have a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Then what will you do.
6366,"Do you think people like you and JRNY will be putting out videos prior to the crash warning people, or do you expect that it will blindside you guys as well?"
6367,"With Tesla specifically, they don't pay dividends and don't care about the stock value (Elon anyways) which is why I don't think Tesla will sell if Elon can help it.
As for everyone else, since Grayscale is one of the only funds with bitcoin and they have a lockup period, I'm guessing the crash will happen whenever the SEC approves a bitcoin ETF."
6368,"Remember, some of the institutions that ""didn't like bitcoin"" were buying it the whole time."
6369,"So, I guess this is the Reverse Pump and Dump. Trash and Cash In?"
6370,Great content! Controversial yet very refreshing 👍🏼
6371,Semi click bait. Also some good points. Cheers
6372,Maybe Tesla would pull the rug. But only if BTC dips significantly. It's more about what the miners do and if they believe in bitcoin long term
6373,"Man, so thankful that you are the angel on my right shoulder while the devil on my left tells me that this will last forever. And yes I guess you are 100% right. Hope I'll be pessimistic enought..."
6374,Should I buy ada on binance? Just looking for safe crypto guidance
6375,"Good shit Alex! People will do what they are incentivised to do. Market forces isn't magic, and I love your down to earth take on it. I watch you and a few others differing people to balance my own viewpoint on this all. Keep it up brother"

6383,"Finally common sense and good insight! People can't understand what institutions mean!! With 5% they are the happiest people on the planet! They will be selling every 5% up day!!! Institutions mean stability! Forget 20x'! And to make it simple: bitcoin's ultimate value is the amount of dollars in circulation divided by 21000000! That's where this bubble will stop if the good scenario is on! In between guys, sell and buy back!!! The bad scenario I  ll explain on my own podcast!!"

6388,Big Crush is coming 100%
6389,"You are very right. The moonboys in the comments are trapped in an illogical mindset fueled by optimism and inexperience. I was one of them in 2017 and I watched as people literally put their life savings into bitcoin and got destroyed in the spring/summer of 2018. I took a bit of a hit myself and sold at a loss, but this time I am wiser. Got in around October last year, already took profits these past few weeks just in case. Now I'm thinking about buying the dip."
6390,thank you !!!!!
6391,Thanks Alex idk shit about crypto I just do what you say 😂
6392,"My professor has been teaching at some real estate for since 1970 estimates Bitcoin will cross to maybe a low of $3,000 if it goes below $3,000 it's going to be a hell of a ride back up well you're going to have mining all over the world being shut down excerpt are more profitable and more sustainable ethereum may be able to weather the storm but inevitably they're going to have ethereum may be able to weather the storm but inevitably they're going to have"
6393,Sell it the installations they are waiting
6394,Well that's the nature of it it will crash after every cycle
6395,"Isnt it called ""taking profit""??? and to think it happens at the top of the market??? who ever saw that coming?? Its like ""unprecedented"" ...... yeesh... cpt fkn obv"
6396,hard effin truth man... thanks for the reminder of that once forgotten Blood Bath
6397,"Alex, you failed bigly on this brother.... These corporations are using Bitcoin as an asset which can be used to leverage their tax obligations. If Bitcoin goes down, they win; bigger write-off, if Bitcoin goes up, they win; no need to report gains...... Study their purchases before you mislead your followers."
6398,1000% agree my guy
6399,Awesome video! It's what i learned in 2017-2018  some different scenarios this time around but will still do a similar cycle!
6400,Saylor will never sell

6411,"I am a long term bitcoin maximalist hodler. If I have good reason to think BTC is about to crash by 50% from $100K, 150K, or wherever it's ultimately heading to later this year, then I'm definitely selling off a good chunk which I will later convert back into BTC when I it's near the bottom of the crash."
6412,Anyone relying on this guy for advice needs to do way more of their own research. Then you’ll understand that he don’t know much
6413,"This is on the assumption that when the dollar falls, Bitcoin won't recover faster. I think ur right, certain companies will sell to recover, hell they might fight out a bit before heading out but once the market crashes, the dollar goes down with it and institutions don't want that either. It's gonna be bitcoin vs the federal dollar. What do u think institutions who don't even depend on American infrastructure anymore( most of them using Chinese cheap labor) will fight to re-value the dollar? I don't think so either. Who the f knows what will happen but I hold a little more credit to crypto managing better than the uncontrollable inflation printer the fed has recently become"
6414,"the guys who are making the decisions to buy bitcoin using institution funds UNDERSTAND bitcoin. they won't suddenly sell it all. they get that it is a volatile asset that has major appreciation over time. plus, why would they purposefully lose the support of all their investors who also love bitcoin"

6417,"Keeping it real as always Alex 👍👏🙏🏻, I am completely with you on this way of thinking. Trading like an Ostrich with your head buried deep in the sand, never turns out well. 🤔😜😩"
6418,This hit me right in the feels.
6419,"there is a really good case for 60k being the top of this cycle that started 12 months ago, 1% got out"
6420,"Hit the nail on the head ,great insight 👍👏"
6421,No lambo ?
6422,"If we good for 20 years tho...i'll pass on the rest of this dark, dystopian stuff"
6423,"It looks like crypto is getting increasingly popular as people spend record on screen time, it only feels natural now more than ever that a shift in money is ready to happen
So crash doesn't matter as it will only get bigger in the long term. I don't think this can be avoided as of now
Unless EMP meteor hits earth"
6424,It helps these corporations to hold BTC (asset) for tax reasons.  If the price crashes 50% Tesla gets to write off the difference and when the price goes up 50% they don't have to claim it.  It's a long term play.  Do your homework bro.
6425,I care about the Earth 😅
6426,up or down ... expect both
6427,Not sure if it's really better to be out too early rather than too late. Psychologically this might be easier to digest - but on pure $$ terms it's probably not. Calling the end of a bull market after a 50% drop is easier than picking a random day during the bull run and seeing it go up another 4x...
6428,straight forward!

6430,"Bro, do you think they could just sell all of their $1.5B worth of Bitcoin in a blink of an eye? Cmon... They just started accepting Bitcoin as payment as well lol. 
IMO, these huge companies are buying to hold for 20+ years man."
6431,"So , when Bitcoin crashes is time to buy alts? New in crypto"
6432,"They can sell all they want. But someone will be there to buy it and drive the price back up, Alex"
6433,Wow it's nice seeing Alex back on the whiteboard sharing his wisdom 🙏
6434,"The parabolic climbs will be there, but they'll naturally get smoother over time. I think it's likely the cycles are lengthening too."
6435,The end is NIGH
6436,So what do you recommend doing? Putting it all in stable coins?
6437,I agree with what alex is saying. I think it's important to add that many companies couldn't get into bitcoin last bullrun because there wasn't enough liquidity. Now there is enough liquidity
6438,"Absolutely makes sense Alex! I can agree with you , but if everything collapse what's the option to secure our assets? ✌Fiat has no value we know. Stocks will crash as well. Real-estate?
Just to add, don't get me wrong I believe crypto currencies is the future and I will try to get out of this bull run on time ,buying the dips later, and hodl 🤑✌"

6446,"Mr Woke Becker, what would you propose we buy with our depreciating cash when we sell our bitcoin into worthless USD?"
6447,I would not touch Bitcoin.
6448,"The crash is here, everyone is having the same discussion about trying to get out at 64 or 75k or 95k, before the correction. The market fools the maximum number of people with the maximum amount of pain.  What is happening, the economy is reopneing people are forced to spend money that has been locked up, they have to go out with their friends, they have to drive to work, they have to visit family, etc.  They will start taking the money out of stocks and crypto that was ""savings"" locked away.  On top of this Yields and the dollar are going up, money is getting more expensive, which means the premise that the dollar is collapsing is on hold for now, as the dollar tightens."

6455,The Bitcoin crash you propose does make a lot of sense.    What percentage of Bitcoin do the Corporations now hold ?  Anyone know ?
6456,"Nice update Alex! By the start of this week’s tradlng session, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that tradlng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodlng and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Walter Aarav program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2.6 Btc with Walter’s  help.

Cryptocurrency have seen far more worse times than this.
Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions.
Few months back, I started trading, though I knew just the basics of trading. I have seen a lot of money being made by people in just few weeks of trading. this was a motivation for me to go into crypto trading full time.
I wasn't able to capture the secret to understanding the use of signals so I lost huge amount of money due to inexperience untill I got connected to a trading expert Ms Rachael Davis on t-e-l-e-g-r-a-m.

I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when I encou ntered Eric Clark services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Eric John Clark that has made me over 20ʙᴛᴄ.

7428,"The major challenges investors face may range from controlling impulsiveness to the frail of compulsion. Most newbies and would-be investors often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. Permit me to say that, it’s is best advice you find a working strategy/daily signals that works well in other to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio ahead. I have been trading with DR Benjamin keen's daily signals and strategy, him guidance makes trading less stressful and more profit despite the recent fluctuations. I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just 4weeks of trading with Ben keen daily signals growing 1.5 BTC to 6.7 BTC. His daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who love crypto trading, you can contact him on WhatsApp: +447-8621-00767 and Telegram : @ Ben_Keen* * for inquires and profitable trading systems..."

7438,"You clearly don’t know the relevance of bitcoin and the huge institutional backing bitcoin has now. 😂 Just to open up your eyes, FYI, Bitcoin is made by a group called Satoshi Nakamoto in a way that only 21 million bitcoin can be mined in the whole world in which 18 million bitcoin has already been mined. It is completely decentralised and can be a fighting chance against the growing inflation. With all the institutional buyers coming in and buying huge amounts of btc per day, there’s a huge amount of demand and less supply. These institutional buyers aren’t like retail buyers who sell when they see a small dip in the chart. They can move markets. Bitcoin is considered a store of value by these buyers and is slowly starting to be considered digital gold. Also, now that bitcoin has shattered the all time highs of 2017, combined with all other facts, we don’t know where the price is gonna go. So, I think you should be doing proper research on bitcoin and the technical aspects of it before you make these videos. 😂 Having said all of these, it definitely has it’s risks, and putting in all of your life’s earnings isn’t recommended 😂 But still investing a small 5% of your portfolio would be a wise thing to do. 👍🏼"

And guruji is human so its impossible to hold knowledge n information on everything ... he wont be able to learn abt crytography n economics as he is expert in unboxing mobile phones...  Its even true that the risk of investing is high frm both sides of returns n losses bt I would recommend people to know what actually Bitcoin orother cryoto curencies like eth,  cardano n oll is n purpose behind it then I am sure people will understand the value of it...  Jay Hind...    people with million subscriber like Guru ji doesnt mean he knows everything ..  Aniways no offfence have a good life n please make sure u do ur homeworks before investing as well..."

Wait for a moment, there will be a dip and then you can buy if you like. Visit my Youtube channel if you like. #Euresh_Paudy"

If thinking about short-term, you should really do a lot of research, and should be able to handle a greater risk. It is true that you can make a lot of money in a short term but we all should know that we can also lose all the money.
For all those who are saying that he has no idea in cryptocurrency, I want to say that this is all he wanted to say."

Mining bitcoin consumes electricity equivalent of a 200 million population at the current price of bitcoin $28000. China is the primary source of Bitcoin mining, and the main source of electricity production is coal, which is also very bad for the environment. Please stop buying bitcoin and stop promoting it as this will eventually kill our Earth. Bitcoin is a negative-sum game, so some people win, and others lose.

Just because of your Stupid Video, Many people who might have invested in Bitcoin, unhone invest nahi kiya hoga ye soch kar ki humaare Role Model ne mana kiya hai to sahi hi hoga.. Humaare So called Guruji ne Mana kiya hai..

And you are the reason they didn't invested and didn't have any profit now.
Simply, you are the reason that they are in loss..

So have some work ethics..
Bye !n"
7960,In my view you should invest more in stocks and less in cryptocurrency.because in stocks u have many datas of company from which u can decide the future values but in cryptocurrency u cant know what will be the future price of it. so risk is high but cryptocurrency investing gives you oppurtunity to diversify your investment. So i invest around 10 percent of my investment in crypto.

8005,"Guys COINSWITCH excange rates are very bad.

for eg. I ordered worth 1,00,000 INR VET(VeChain)  but just after order it reflected that I had only worth 95,833.33 INR VET(VeChain). So technically I am paying 4.16% exchange fee for my VET ( VeChain) order.

At the same time When Buy rate for VET is 1.20 INR , Selling rate is 1.15 INR.
so  (1.20-1.15)/1.20 = 4.16% exchange fee.

Guys this is too much , can not trade in this way with COINSWITCH platform"

I’ve earned a lot of wealth only from this. So stop talking about in which you have zero knowledge. You are perfect in unboxing DABBA not in blockchain technology so stop saying all the nonsense. Ponzi schemes are different and they lie in every sector. Guess you also wanted to buy bitcoin at $5k but sorry it has now already crossed $24k. Better luck next time !

Ur giving knowledge to others that is already present on GSM arena and cryptos require technical and fundamental analysis that u don't have ...unscribe ur useless channel.. Tu bad baith ke dabbe khol

But other than that I think you need to educate yourself about what cryptocurrencies are and why it is the future ... Bitcoin has failed as a payment method, but it is a great store of value .. and Ethereum, Cardano, ChainLInk, PolkaDot etc have real use cases ... Check out VeChain ... It solves real world problem of fixing the supply chain after coivd ... DFi, Dapps, NFT are the future ..."

Will it get banned again in the future? You need to know about these details atleast to invest in bitcoin. Instead of barking like dogs use your brain like a human being."

Crypto is a blooming industry and smart people's are invited for investments.. Smart infulencers or scammers se agar aap bach gaye toh aapko yeha successful banne se koi nahi rok sakta.

I have two favourites OnePlus 8T and OnePlus 7T pro( I know it is old and older hardware but when it price came from 55,000 inr to 41,380 inr It got me blown away and my brother also had this phone and he told that still in 2020 this phone is really great)

So my favourites are OnePlus  8T and OnePlus 7T pro except these two if there is another ultra phone do tell me. Please give me the name of the best best ultra phone that I can buy in 40,000 price segment

The Bitcoin trading market is constantly evolving with market fluctuations and trading opportunities . You can make fast profits but trading without experience and the right strategies you can lose even faster . Another thing is your risk management plan even if your wining system is good lack of risk management skills will make you give back all your profits at some point that's why I advice you work with a professional and registered trader , I work with Mr. Daniel and he has taught me how to capitalize on cryptocurrency and his trading signals and strategies have proven to bring out the best result with his knowledge and experience . So far I've made reasonable profits . I recommend him and don't forget as some are snoozing others are capitalizing and winning.

9731,Bhai aapko chennal ke naam ke aage se technical nikaldena chahiye kyuki aapko blockchain ka knowledge hi nahi hai
9732,"Very humbly speaking, ye bahot baseless video thi. Mujhe aapka message samajh aagaya but you mixed everything into this video. 
Knowledge ke name par kuch nahi samjhaya aapne, investment kyu zaruri hai, baki investments ke comparison mei bitcoin itna kyu badh raha hai, kitna badh skta hai ya kab khareede? Agar kisi se aapko dikkat hai to usi par focus karte. 
Target audience ko 3 cheeze chahiye, phone/bike and gf. Logic kaha hai Bhaisahab, kuchbhi matlab? 
Matlab iske upar ki audience aapki nahi hai. And logo ko ye batado ki aap 12-20k ka phone to lelo par bhaiya 5k ka investment mat karo. Ye umar ke logo ko financial independence ke knowledge dene ke bajae aap gf/phone/bike batarahe hai waah. 
Aapka message ye tha ki it's risky toh sochke karo but aapne ye bhi kaha ki bitcoin mei invest karne ki zarurat hi kya hai ? 
Logo ko inflation batana zaruri nahi hai ? 1970 mei Rs.100 mei kya  aajata tha aaj kuch nahi aata, kyu? 
 Zarurat ye hai ki this revolution is in its early stage, traditional markets ke comparison mei crypto market is very very small. Haan mana ki recent years mei kuch clarity nahi thi but agar news ko follow karoge to pata chalega ki baki govts isko regulate karrahi hai, billions of dollars ki institutional buying chalrahi hai market mei, TECHNICALITIES chodh ke aapne sab bata diya. 
Agar 50 jagahe hai invest karne ki to ye bhi to hai hi ek jagah.
I hope ki aap is topic ko detailed tareeke se samjhae taki baki logo ko actually mei pata chale ki ye hai kya, 
How is it different from stocks? Iski value itni kyu badhti hai ? Ya why it's so volatile? How is it different from gold (due to  limited supply) ? 
Jab aap ye sab cover karke apna opinion de use kahenge ek unbiased and knowledgeable viewpoint. 🙂"

Instead teach them to become a trader, teach them how you can manage your money, teach if you are already influenced to invest in bitcoin then how much you should invest. There is  many more things to teach. Don't always promote negativity , tell them pros and cons at the same time."

10528,"Sir, you lack knowledge of bitcoin.

You are giving example of potato that someone needs someone not.
But everyone needs money. Bitcoin may soon replace dollar as a world reserve currency. And may replace gold as a store of value. And in this process wealth will be transfer and those holding bitcoins will gain those wealth. So educate Indians about bitcoin that what it is , people outside india like in us are buying bitcoins. Why?
Because dollar is going to collapse as government prints currency backed by nothing. And there will only be 21 million bitcoins."

I am saying worthless because it is just a technology, you are using public private key encryption right now and you don't pay for it, rather you don't even know about it, you know why because I can build that technology if I wish to, same applies to bitcoin, bitcoin is nothing but a software that is dealing with ledger for which no one can be held responsible, if anything goes wrong, and I tell you being a software engineer myself things do go wrong, and if each bitcoin costs 15 lacs, single one will cost you same, and you are supporting such dumb stuff."

10745,"Great content as usual. Although bitcoin struggled to clear the $18,600 resistance zone. A high is formed near $18,639 and the price is currently showing a few bearish signs. Even with all this, it makes it a very hard decision for both old holders and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell, but rather the potentials of tradlng Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving you from any future deep that may occur. I started tradng with Philip Walton since late last year and till date I have made over 18 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey. How? Two words, Tradlng SlgnaIs.

11069,"Banks interests are going down. 
Money printing is highest today which decreases its value and increased inflation. 

INR currency Inflation rate - 5.1% 
USD currency Inflation rate - 1.8%
World wide inflation - 4.7%

Meaning Currencies are losing values, government printing money like crazy & Things will be more & more expensive.

For example. 2016 it cost 2 Bitcoins to purchase latest iPhone 6 in 2020 you can buy 9 latest iPhone 12 using 1 Bitcoin. You know iPhone prices are almost double from where it started. Same goes for everything else and even gold. 

Bitcoin is deflationary, if you don't buy it on average today it'll be way more expensive in future. You won't get rich but you'll get more fiat currency in return. 

You can't get rich in short term investing in BTC but definitely increase your currency value investing in BTC.

I wonder why Gaurav made this video while he haven't educated people about bitcoin  like he did back in 2018. 

Ye video like aur subscribe karne se pehle Bitcoin buy zarur kar lena.."

11150,"एक कहानी मुझे सबको बतानी है,
थोड़ी सी नई है और थोड़ी सी पुरानी है,
कुछ बातें सुनी कुछ अनजानी है,
मेरी कामयाबी मेरे सपनों की रानी है,
मेरे चाहने वाले मुझसे प्यार करते हैं,
जो जलते हैं वो भी मुझे फॉलो करते हैं,
बातें आज सारी विस्तार से बता दूं,
तो चलिए शुरू करते हैं….
सीधा-साधा लड़का नाम गौरव राजस्थान से,
रहता हूं दुबई प्यारा देश अपनी जान से,
अंग्रेजी है आती फिर भी हिंदी में मैं बोलता,
प्राउड टू बी इंडियन जय हिंद शान से,
जीता नहीं ज़िंदगी मैं हवाबाज़ी करके,
ऐश नही की रखी ज़िम्मेदारी सर पे,
पापा के थे सपने जो थे मुझको पूरे करने,
साथ होते आज तो वह गर्व मुझ पर करते,
मेरी कामयाबी मेरे सर पर नहीं चढ़ती,
क्योंकि मां मेरी हर एक गलती को पकड़ती,
पहले व्यूस चेक करता था कैलकुलेट करके,
आजकल हर एक वीडियो है ट्रेंडिंग पर चढ़ती,
छोटी छोटी आंखों में में सपने बड़े रखता,
ना कभी भी मैं अपने काम से हूं थकता,
सुबह राजस्थान शाम को मैं बैंगलोर में,
अहमदाबाद से गुवाहाटी मीटप करता,
ईगो नहीं रखी मैंने काम रखा भारी है,
जिनसे फोटो तू खींचाए उनसे मेरी यारी है,
जीता हूं मैं खुद हार मुझसे मेरी हारी है,
कछुए सी चाल चलके मैंने बाजी मारी है,
मैंने बाजी मारी है…
लाइफ इस गुड जो होता सब सही है,
मेरा किसी से भी कोई कंपटीशन नहीं है,
मैं चलता चलूं आगे पीछे ना मैं मुड़ता,
सब आगे बढ़े मेरी दुआ बस यही है,
सब मेरे यार दोस्त सब मेरे भाई हैं,
अपनों से भी किस बात की लड़ाई है,
छोटा हो या बड़ा मैं सब से हूं सीखता,
मेरे हालातों ने मुझे जिंदगी पढ़ाई है,
जिनका था मैं फैन आजकल वो भी जानते,
मेरे कर्मों से लोग मुझको पहचानते,
सच-सच सारी बातें आपको बताता हूं,
मेरी मातृभाषा को मैं आगे लाना चाहता हूं,
2 साल पहले 0 अब लाखों साथ हैं,
खुशनसीबी मेरी मिले हाथों से जो हाथ हैं,
बातें उनकी होती जिनमें होती कोई बात है,
मुझे आपने बनाया मेरी क्या औकात है,
हां मेरी क्या औकात है… हां मेरी क्या औकात है…"

11771,Old giruji is back love you
11772,"The real purpose of life is to find god. and secret to reach him is inside you. but you only can't reach with your capacity . In this way you need someone who has reached to God . kalki avatar,imam Mehdi , Riaz Ahmed gohar shahi etc.., names is given to him.and in many religions there said that in last times of world someone will come and he will have power given by God by which he will initiate all human kind heart with God and  love of God .now he have came and his images is on moon ,sun,maha shiv ling,hajr e aswad etc,, he only will help you to reach God. But you reach to God only if god's gives permission otherwise you can't become saint.but at least try your luck.
They will give you zikr of God in which you believes.that zikr will start with your heart beats and God can come in your heart too. for true spirituality.
So go and take zikr e qalb by contacting (Alra TV) @alratv YouTube channel and also watch. He is for all human kind.for all religions. He may come in your dreams.just at least try . I think there is nothing wrong in taking zikr of god's name and giving 5 mins to take zikr for your spiritual growth. so best of luck take zikr.may god accept you.

Log sochte hai ki ye halwa, but iske liye dimaak chahiye, naki bas ye vol dena ""mujhe lag raha ye graph ab upar jaega"" and then say "" mai sahi tha aur main isse earn kiye itne rupay"".

 Shares ke jo graph hote hai na unko study krne mei hi ga*nde phat jaati hai, jo log karte hai kabhi unn se picho ki kitna time aur dimaak lagata hai ye sab seekhne mei. Naki bas 4 ya 5 hazzar rupay ke liye promotion kr do kisi chitiya app ka.

 And one thing more ye jo apps ka promotion ho raha hai , inn mei kuch apps to hai jo ki kuch countries mei ban hai. Kyunki kai baar vo apka paisa galat jagah invest krwa deti hai.

Mat pado kisi ke influence nei ki paisa kamane ko milega free mai. Mehnat karo to hi phal milega."

I'm disappointed with this video of Guruji. He talks about how the world is ignorant, while he himself don't know about Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is not run by anyone, no one encourages you to buy it. There are scams built around it, just like there are scams built around gold. Does that mean Gold is a scam? 

After this video I'm relieved that this isn't the top as your favourite influencer is still a sheep. 

Good luck guys."

14920,The hardest thing a small youtuber can feel is when you wake up in the morning and nothing has changed on your channel. Its always been my childhood dream to become a youtuber. The videos uploaded by the creators makes me strong and gives me motivation to make my own videos. I am a casual gamer.....just being able to edit makes me feel so satisfied and proud. Even though i got no viewers and very low subscribers but watching my work makes me so happy And hopefully I can make so much people happy with my videos ! I hope one day miracle happens? i will do anything to make my childhood dream a reality❤ ! THANKS :(

16029,First bro
16030,hi guruji
16031,First
16032,First
16033,First view.Gaurav my most trusted tech adviser.
16034,First
16035,This video is superb.Trading bitcoin requires adequate tutelage from an expert. Mrs Juliana has helped me attain really high level of financial freedom from using her as my broker.She’s reliable and trustworthy
16036,We pay massive fees for crypto now I don’t understand
16037,"I make huge profits on my investment since i started trading with Mrs. Christi Lily, her trading strategies are top notch"
16038,If we want cryptocurrency to stay and thrive then we must start voting for politicians that will support cryptocurrency. Best way to make them change their way so we get our way. Stand up and fight. Spread this message. Time to change before it gets shut down.
16039,"When this video was uploaded the bitcoin price was somewhere $42,000. And today it is 57k just wow!"
16040,"The cryptocurrency has a fresh record high for in three years last month as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can see now the market is very unstable , the truth is that you can always make more profit from tradn rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started tradn with David Hunt since late last year and till date have made over 12 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey. With David Hunt help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin , you can easily get to David on :Teleg:ram : @Davidhuntcrypto."
16041,BTC changed my life
16042,"Calling ""people"" buy bitcoin and so its price increase is total missleading and a bs for an educational video. There are only very few big players involved into price inflation. The masses dont have such buying power, no matter how many millions we got on your bank accounts, need few billions instead to see some real price increase and not a mere +0,0005%. Not that we call each other even, telling hey lets buy btc all at once, lets make it spike! Same stuff for alts, forex, stocks etcetc. Cut the crap off, sir"
16043,"bitcoin will ultimately fail because the transactions use a lot of energy and that energy mostly comes from coal, so you can't have a world that is so cautious about protecting the environment yet at the same time support bitcoin."
16044,"We all know how a pyramid scheme ends. Every time they say: This time it is different. It's never different. Same experiment, same result. Wait and watch."
16045,Wtf f bitcoin is high risk?  Who says? Whats the higher risk then.owning klepto fiat which is melting away at 15 per cent per annum...wheres the comparative risk....?
16046,"Quick correction 3:00 Bitcoin's price cant mathematically go to 0 let alone below 10k at this point. Amount of lost/unrecoverable bitcoins keep the price of bitcoin up, even if everyone sold."
16047,"It doesn’t look good as of this moment...price and volume and slowly dropping off the highs. We will see.  Currently $53k, all time high was around $62K"
16048,How do you lose everything if Bitcoin is here to stay?
16049,"This is gonna be good, all the poor people whom think BTC and crypto are a good idea, something seems fishy..."
16050,"I don't know  who needs to this, you've got to stop saving money to buy luxurious and exotic cars, invest your money wisely to so many other of you really want financial success"
16051,"The last 48 hours saw CHZ hike by over 18% on the price charts, despite some rangebound action being the norm over the last few trading sessions. The lack of a corresponding uptick in trading volume may have contributed to the latter, with CHZ, failing to extend its uptrend on the charts. XEM, the altcoin ranked 47th on CoinMarketCap, has been at the end of a sharp downtrend since the market-wide depreciation on the 16th of the month. While recovery efforts have been made of late, most notably, the 22 % hike in the last 48 hours, XEM was still trad|ng at a level well below the highs seen earlier in the year. With the trade volume refusing to hike exponentially, it would be difficult for XEM to climb to its local top in the near term. What’s more, the alt was still over 80% away from its ATH of $1.37. with the pr|ce movement it’s safe to say the crypt0currency market is highly volatile and if handled properly can be very profitable. I tr@:de daily with Vincente Sanz's tr@de signa|s and I have been successful in my tra’des, accumulating over 14 btc in prof!ts in the last seven months just by copying his tra’de calls in my tr@des. Vincente is a pro tra:der, author/publisher, and tra:de s!gnal provider with a lot of free contents on the internet to aid newbies to become better and more proficient tra:ders and he can be reached through his *ͲҽӀҽցɾąʍ:@vincentesanz and GmalI:vicentesanzofficial@gmailcom* for any crypto inclined inquiries...."
16052,BUY THE F#CKING DIP 🚀
16053,Nice content but I rather stick with ClarkInvesting platform schemes.
16054,"Governments around the world especially the US government are over printing their currencies. I guess it something to due with covid.
For every Dollar, Renminbi, Deutsche Mark, or Peso printed makes the ones in your bank account less valuable. This is a flat out tax that most people pay very little attention to. 
Bitcoin up turn in value is partially or mostly due to it not being diluted from over printing by any government."
16055,thechinahacks are so awesome .They helped me out financially with their platform .
16056,"I think the pandemic has taught people a big lesson, having one stream of income is not really a good idea cause your job doesn't secure your financial needs. The pandemic has really set out business-minded people from the rest that is why I'm  so lucky to be among the investor's trading with Mrs Linda Jo's, as her student it's been successful and happiness since the beginning of my trades"
16057,"You didn't explain anything really, also that comparison with apple and  gold and was idiotic along with quotes. Useless video."
16058,"So everybody is starving themselves now, so maybe, just *maybe* in the future, they will eat better than than majority... 



Okay"
16059,"Crypto is on quite up run, with little sign of stopping. I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the number of banks, institutions, and companies who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars with the intent to hold long-term: how can we refute that this may be the ""supercycle"" everyone is talking about? The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. βͲ↻ still has a ways to go in terms of gro wIth, I have been in the crypt0 world for just over a year now and I have been able to make 30 βͲ↻ following the reasonable advice and train sIgnals from Barret Ezell, a pro analysis that is always one step ahead of other trades, he runs a program for serious-minded investor/newbies who are curious to earn from bitcoin regardless of the current price chart. You can easily get to Barret on Եҽl ҽցɾαต @barretezell01 or you should contact him on email bcezell500@gmail.com"
16060,"Automate is truly the safest platform you can invest your funds.I must commend the platform, they are always consistent with withdrawals and their payments are automated always making me happy💯"
16061,I keep hearing bubble in all the news its like they keep trying to scare us. Even if bitcoin slips and loses 50% of its value I truly believe it'll 10X in a flash. I don't wanna lie hearing bubble is scaring me from jumping in but fuck it if I lose ill be just like my dad on dot com bubble lol
16062,"Automate is truly the safest platform you can invest your funds.I must commend the platform, they are always consistent with withdrawals and their payments are automated always making me happy💯.."
16063,These days a lot of people no longer go in search for jobs. Bitcoin has made success more easier than we thought.
16064,Wow!! this video is just so wonderful . But cryptocurrency trading requires strategies of an expert to avoid unnecessary loss while trading. Mrs Janet has been my broker and I’m really proud of my financial status right now. She’s really reliable and trustworthy .
16065,"Exactly, just as long as you know it's a bet, not investment."
16066,Check out wall street silver on reddit.  It's a good place to park your crypto profits.
16067,"Automate is truly the safest platform you can invest your funds.I must commend the platform, they are always consistent with withdrawals and their payments are automated always making me happy💯"
16068,"Bitcoin is The future, lnvesting in it now will be the wisest thing to do especially with the current rise"
16069,I would like to sell all my bitcoin to this youtuber.  please help me
16070,It’s obvious the government and Bitcoin did this! Cryto and stocks is so fixed it’s not funny all around the world you telling me cryto crash lol it’s manipulation that’s intentional
16071,"The crash won't happen momentarily, but fall with style.🤸‍♂️"
16072,"Thanks for this great video, you are a gift to everyone watching it.
At this crucial time, telling someone about Bitcoin investment is not just a financial advice by all factor but a life advice. For a trustworthy broker, think about Ms Olivia."
16073,"What is its use case?
What does it do? 
Gold has a 12000 year record as money so can't compare the 2. 
Every single person who buys BTC plans on selling it to someone else for more money. Its actually insane."
16074,"Criticizing the banking system for the “cut” they take with every transaction when bitcoin transactions cost much more is funny! And criticizing the banks control when bitcoin is ever more in the hands of the big miners is even funnier! It’s very, very disappointing seeing bitcoin become even worse than what it was supposed to replace!"
16075,"Waitting for bearish market though. all leveraged bearish tokens 3x short, will gain incredible value. Now they are like less than 0.001$ and once bears kicks in, BTC drops, 3x short tokens gains value, then buy BTC as much as you want it."
16076,I would bet my life Bitcoin becomes sub 20k again before 2024
16077,"I think the pandemic has taught people a big lesson, having one stream of income is not really a good idea cause your job doesn't secure your financial needs. The pandemic has really set out business-minded people from the rest that is why I'm so lucky to be among the investors trading with *metro__kelvinfx* on insta. as his student, it's been success and happiness since the beginning of my trades"
16078,Why bitcoin? With dogecoin or some penny stocks you can make more money.
16079,So what is the Problem With The 2021 Bitcoin Bubble?
16080,"I think from the view of today 20.4.2021 that it's time for bitcoin to go back to $10-15k.


The price when I posted this comment is $56k"
16081,"Hi u all
I am quiet new here. I have a question. What happens when the bull run is over? Can Btc go back to 20.000? And Eth?
Thanks a lot"
16082,"PONZI/PYRAMID SCHEME WARNING!! It doesn't take ape to figure out that all the crypto coins will continue to be printed at a much faster pace than any legit currency. Do not pump your stim checks that are meant to stimulate your OWN economy into hot air. These crypto currencies are directly linked to black market drug dealers, rogue nation states, child endangerment and above all a lack of education. Why on earth would you want to devalue your own currency in favor of a digital fiat that will be pumped and dumped the next day. Have some pride in yourself and your country sheeple. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE or that YOU DONT UNDERSTAND FINANCE"
16083,I think It’s a little different though now that companies are investing. You have institutions in it now. It makes it more stable. It’s not all retail investors now trying to hodl their retirement savings.
16084,"have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience, I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people, One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticising bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset, there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook, line and sinker and of course, those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing.  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) . Persistence and commitment and love for success is what you need in the crypto space and we all can.             cryptoforex60@gmail. Com"
16085,"Most wise investors with crypto uses the opportunity of when there is a drop in the market to buy and day trade with a working strategy and a plan to navigate the market system using the low price in the market to trade daily speculating the increase in price. Get a working plan today for that profit-making. fact is, BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest ? Before jumping into a conclusion I think you should take a look at things first,for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if is going bearish or bullish. while others still continues to trade without fear of losing, others are being patient. For me trading has been going well because I use a day trading system that helps me  with signals which have made me to accumulate over 8.5btc in two weeks.get a working strategy with the help of an expert his telegram (@ ) and on wtsap (+447828450768"
16086,"Guys! have anyone else noticed the price of ethereum is on the rise again? An expert on crypto currencies posted about the price dynamism of ethereum, he said the market is bound to either go up or down, but the ability for an investor to study the price history and properly access the flow of the market is what is called market analysis and can be done by anyone. Ethereum is gaining momentum above the $1,250 and $1,280 resistance levels. I see only opportunities for holders and traders, although i would go for the latter because its much more profitable. Overtime, i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with my trading and also tried couple of strategies from renowned experts in the trading business.

 answer is more, from the very minute he buys it the price will climb... and he knows this, so does dick smith, koch and keiser... and this is why they will tell you about this ""gold mine"".

(taxes that is used to run the country) but consider what will happen if it hits a trillion, will they be happy to watch, loosing 200 billion in taxes...  so what will happen the 

minute they find a way to control it (tax it)... capital gains is as much as 50%.. more importantly, who will know one day before, you! me! or the nice rich people... there is one guarantee... when losses occur, it will be mum's and dad's again that will suffer the greatest losses... want a worse case scenario, what if the government suddenly deem it illegal and turns off the connection to bitcoin... you loose the lot...

Thousands upon thousands of companies with a depreciating asset ""Cash"" sitting on their balance sheets just looking for something else to put that into.  My guess is each company will convert at a minimum 5% of their cash into BTC... What will that push the market cap up too??? multi-trillions of dollars and then just divide by how many BTC's are available and boom, there is your new price.

What person selling a good or service is going to want to take on that risk?   Seems like a big scam to me.

So eventually the cost of mining may become so high in terms of energy and time that it will be no longer worth it and if all the miners leave, all BTC transactions will just stop, won't they?

Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, I know some hodlers are happy at the moment due to the recent rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts. That's why it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto tradlng came my way. ""Why hold a currency you can multiply or grow?"" With much energy channeled into tradlng bitcoin daily with unique slgnals, it was no surprise how my portfolio went from 3 Bitcoin to 19 Bitcoin within a year.

I am glad I know what I do, looked into both sides, have put money down into this and I can confidently say that 80-90% of people do not understand the concept of value and how it applies to currency. It is literally like saying ""This paper dollar is worth 100x more than this paper dollar? This could never work! It is based on paper!"" or ""an original babe ruth baseball card can't be worth 1 million dollars, my house is not worth a fraction of the price of a baseball card""."

16320,"Digital coins have lots and lots of problems that people ignore. Stolen from you? Have you been deceived? Can not help. Lost your account hacked? there's nothing to do. more and more...

At the end of the day, whoever is not a criminal has no problem being followed, between us we are not important and no one cares what we do.

The big companies already know what we do all the time so what does it matter.

Comfort and a better experience will always always prevail over anonymity. Few people think this is not true. But it's only in their minds.

Besides, do you think the state can not follow you on the blockchain? You are naive, it is a matter of time before technology and computing power overcome it.

We as a society want good monitoring of money, so that people can not steal from each other or from the government (if there is criticism against the government then attack it, but undo the basis will cause disaster).

If a person steals 100 million. And transfers to a completely anonymous account that cannot be tracked.

Only then does the government really care about it, and then it takes the money out of it.

But with Bitcoin it is impossible to take the money. And we encourage injustice."

I've been in the last two groups, but with the assistance of  Josh Antonio whose trade I've been copying for over four months now, netting in more than 3btc and over $25,000 in profit already.

16364,"B!tcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) appear to be experiencing something of a slowdown, as on-chain data shows a dramatic decrease in the U.S dollar value of coins being sent across both blockchains in the past week. At the same time, transaction fees for both chains have receded from recent highs, or in Ethereum’s case, an all-time high. Data from Bitinfocharts shows $46.68 billion worth of BTC was sent across the Bitcoin blockchain on Feb. 25. For some context, that’s around 5% of the total Bitcoin market cap, which stands at $925 billion at time of writing.  In fact, with the cryptOcurrency dropping below $50k at the time of writing, this just seemed all the more likely. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. It really depends on the pattern with which you always tráde and also the provider of your signals.

16391,"I have some bitcoin and I do think there is a future for it but my problem with it is it is clearly in a bubble right now. This is unpopular and smug to say but once the average guy on the street who knows nothing about investing, or stocks or inflation or whatever is in on something ""that is a sure thing"" that, "" you will miss out on"" then you are clearly in a bubble. it's mania and hysteria. Literally the same exact thing that happened in the mid 000's with housing. All of a sudden everyone was a developer, everyone was  a flipper, everyone knew everything about housing and it was riskless and anyone not involved was a dumbass who obviously didn't want to get rich. doesn't matter what it is, when that becomes the sentiment, you are in a bubble. there is no such thing as a sure thing investment on this earth, never was, never will be, but the majority of those involved with bitcoin aren't saying that. it's all just "" well I guess you don't like money"" or "" enjoy living in your mums basement"". If you literally have to persuade people or insult them  to get in on this thing that's a sure thing, you are just going with a crowd.... again, bubble. bitcoin hasn't even demonstrated yet what it is. some people are saying it's a currency and other's are saying it's a safe-haven asset. It can't become a proper currency until it becomes less volatile and people speculating on it have no interest in it being less volatile because they want quick gains. it can't be a widely used currency until it is stable. you can't wake up every morning and wonder if your money is worth $2000 more or less than it was when you went to bed. How could you ever pay for things like that? why would you spend money that could be worth more tomorrow. How could a business ever accurately price their goods if it changes by so much every day. one day a can of coke is worth a thousandth of a bit coin and the next day it's worth 500th of a bitcoin. So what, they re-sticker all their items every single day? how to they keep up with the conversion and the price change? until that gets sorted, it's never being widely used as a currency. So you have the speculation side, which largely rests on the price continuing to go up, when it stops there will likely be a big run on it. Also what happens to it when it gets to 21 million coins? once it hits it's ceiling it could tank because it's ceiling has been reached and that's when bubbles certainly pop. Other safe-haven assets have either history or inherent value on their side. gold and silver for example can store wealth but they also have use and 5000 years plus of history suggesting value. bitcoin has none of this just people who need to believe it's different. I mean all the reasons people distrust paper money is because it's not backed by anything? what's bitcoin backed by? less? the us dollar rightly or wrongly is backed by the emerican government and economy, bitcoin is backed by nothing. Again, I think it will have use but the clear evidence is at the moment that it's a bubble and that it's potential is all theoretical and not definite. Hence why I am suspicious of anyone claiming it's a sure thing. especially when most of the people involved seem to take a piss and dump based on what musk says on twitter. not exactly logical investing"

16480,"BTC is very limited in supply so isn't it only useful as an asset like gold and not a currency? Gold can sometimes be used as payment and so can BTC, but they are not currencies because there's not enough to go around no? The largest shares of BTC are eventually going to be owned by a very few compared to the global population. That's already happening. Sure we got a decentralized world out of blockchain tech, but it seems like BTC itself is just going to be another fashionable asset like gold. I think the entire purpose of Nakamoto's project was to enter into a decentralized world and I don't think he cared about its use for day traders. The way I see people making money off crypto is no different than the FX market. The only difference being that if you get in early with a crypto, sometimes you can make 100x 1000x etc. But only if you get in early and hodl.  We all know [most] people don't hodl for long. I know people who bought in 2012 but sold at $5k, $10k, $20k etc because you know....everything is 20/20. It could crash any time like you said so people normally cash out. I think BTC is going to crash big time, but much more than previous %'s. Before was the crypto winter, next it will be the crypto nightmare."

The week has seen more bullish news such as the first German-listed company allocating its cash reserves to BTC as well as the launch of the first B!tcoin ETF in Canada, which traded over $220 million in its debut. Such news is fueling the price of Bitco!n, while Elon Musk has also embraced the latest “laser eye” meme to the joy of hodlers who are itching for a $100,000 BTC pr!ce. However, the next major point of interest is at around $63,000, and this could be reached relatively soon if B!tcoin can hold above a few key support levels.

The dollar has 10x the nuances and ability to affect the market in positive ways.

16590,"Videos like this assume the market is the same place as it was in 2015 with more retail buying interest from  individuals on the street. Wrong! This is a whole new game and market. The institutions have moved in. The cypherpunk and retail buyer rises and crashes with tiny percentages of the population even aware this stuff existed is over. I'll spell it out. O.V.E.R. It's a real market now, with real money moving in, and real institutional interest. If you are shorting bitcoin waiting for that crash to $25,000 I'm sorry for you but I'm not. This is not a volatile game like you wanted from all the other times. It'd just not."
16591,you sir are the man
16592,What a shit video Jesus
16593,RIP Banks. You have been replaced by Bitcoin and Defi. Power To The People!

16598,"Paper money is becoming worthless, the pandemic saw a rise in the demand for a contactless mode of payment opposed to paper cash encouraging investors to look into digital currencies, I invest in stocks with over 60 dividend paying stocks and diversify in currency pairs and digital currencies also, quite a large portfolio thanks to my broker (Eddybruke . Info) whose expertise has brought me this far in less than 2 years"
16599,"..but But BUT Bitcoin is up $300 today !!!!     If you can't trust a ""Cyrpto-Currecny-Coin"" (that is not a Coin, is not a Currency, and is not ""Crypto"") with promotional features (like security/stealth/tax free status etc) that were ALL found to be TOTAL LIES, that is being pushed by a group of Elite Globalists who have suddenly flooded $$ Billions into it while the BIG MEDIA has been pumping it like  nothing you have ever seen before, that ...Totally Depends...on about 20 different systems (Power/Net/Net Prov./Comp.tech.etc) within ""The System"" just to function... a majority of which is owned by less than 2000 ""deep insiders"" (65% of who are Communist Chinese) ...That has been RUN UP from .001 cents to $50,000 in 10 years for no ""value based reason"" at all..That can only function on an IP Address system owned/run by the United Nations with most of its servers and technology based in Communist China, that can be used to trace/track/tax everything you do for your entire life...that is a valueless string of coded digits that nobody knows who created.

16600,That was an interesting video.  Thanks
16601,I just purchased another asset with the assistance I got from JASONMADDISON2020 on !G  after receiving my ROI Thanks for the referral and good work... Keep it up sir.

16603,SCALA(XLA) is the way forward.
16604,80% of btc are held by one group..major investors...sounds like a bubble to me
16605,"The Feds keep printing money
Diluting the value of the dollar
Plus inflation rate 5%  or higher
And 0% interest rate on savings,
Why do you  want to keep it in the
Banks or gold.   BTC keep on going
Up so my meager stimulus check
Of $600 went to  $3000 is a God sent.  Let it pop so I can buy more
Satoshi."
16606,"Ok. Don’t trust the government that depends on the solvency of the dollar, but do depend on a bitcoin that depends on how an group of large holders feel about it that could take bitcoin from 50K to 5K in a matter of a few hours. It’s a gamble no matter what. I suggest anyone that has made a decent amount, cash out and buy land."
16607,The crazy thing about cryptos is that there are 4000+ of them and 99% of people’s flock to bitcoin because it was the first cryptocurrency. The altcoins are dirt cheap in comparison and will spike up harder when Bitcoin mania will hit full force later this year
16608,"According to PlanB, BTC should go well over $200,000 before the next bear cycle. His stock to flow model has a great track record. @100trillionUSD"
16609,you are so new to the space lol BTC will never go to zero you should studying on the history of BTC!!!!!
16610,Imagine thinking bitcoin is a bubble lmao.
16611,It's at $51k as of today
16612,I bought bitcoin when it was worth $9k.  That was only last June.
16613,"Bitcoin is the PIN!...................... 
Well, here you are. Some of you came out of curiosity some to earn a little extra, but, all of you came because deep down you know that as the days slip by the world you all knew is fading away.
Maybe, what most of you don't know is that 'you' are making history, you are part of a brand new system that, before your eyes, is tearing down and replacing the old corrupt and, some would say, evil system that has reigned supreme for thousands (at least five) of years. A system that had always been centralised either around royalty or the body politic. The twenty-first century is crying out for change, for a system that treats everyone fair and square.
So, strap in because this will be a bumpy ride. The TPTB hate Bitcoin with a passion because it scares them, and they have not held their lofty positions because they are stupid people (I'm not including politicians in this statement😜). But their only recourse now is to print more and more fiat, and the more they print the stronger Bitcoin becomes. We are in a totally unique position a situation whereby a belief system built on lies and held for thousands of years is being torn down and replaced by a belief system built on truth, fairness and freedom for all people wherever they live.
Max Kaiser calls Bitcoin ""a lifeboat"", and that is exactly what it is! Because when this present paradigm finally collapses in the very near future if you and your family and friends are not on board times will be very very hard."

16616,Selling bitcoins has never been safer and payments has never been this fast. I receive payments very quickly when I sell bitcoins on the AxisOption wallet platform.
16617,People buying Bitcoin with freshly printed stimulus USD is like making someone who is dying dig their own grave
16618,People who buy now are not smart investor. When or if it crash they will be the one loosing the most.
16619,No bubble
16620,POP. People still would buy at each stage of profit taking.
16621,I'm hoping it crashes so i cant buy more
16622,"Talking about bitcoin being adopted as a banking standard is like saying bitcoin would reach over 31 million dollars per coin. It ain't gonna happen. It wasn't designed for it.

In my opinion, XRP is far more capable of it. It was designed to be able to do things like micro loans.

With a total of 100 billion in the maximum supply, XRP would reach 6600 a coin and be capable of handling all the wealth in the world.

As a bitcoin speculator, I do it for fun. As an XRP investor, I do it for the long run. The SEC lawsuit will determine a lot, but with XRP being able to affordably hold the world's wealth, I will stick with XRP long term and Bitcoin as speculation.

I apologize to the bitcoin fan club, but the idea of Bitcoin becoming the banking transaction standard is ridiculous."
16623,"""It could go to zero"" is not an argument or an insightful commentary. 

Because this can be said of anything.

Literally ANYTHING ""could"" go to zero value.

He is basically saying, ""I don't understand it, therefore it could go to zero or a million, and I can't tell you which one, because I don't understand it."""
16624,"Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when i encountered Daron Wilber's services., although i have been into numerous services but he stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favor. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Wades it was more easier to understand, Here are his details on ω𝐇𝓐𝓽ѕ𝓐ρ𝐩 +1(431)813-5396 for his assistance on strictly crypto related concerns."

16627,"It's a bubble. So many people pumping it up higher than it's actual value because of fear of missing out on it's performance. It feeds itself, but it's not sustainable because the traders that pump it run out of liquidity."
16628,This sounds like a guy who isn't aware of/doesn't understand the halving cycles of Bitcoin rewards build into the network.
16629,No matter how the stock market crash one need to have different portfolio. I already invested in forex and crypto which are really profitable
16630,God listen this channel and make bitcoin Blow up big so we all can buy
16631,I think bitcoin is the best
16632,I like how you take the time to describe what bitcoin is. But then you describe something it’s not and miss it’s reason for being. Dig deeper!
16633,"It’s difficult to compare the seventeenth century Dutch gilder with the present day dollar, but reasonable to say tulips were selling for 300 to 500 thousand dollars at the top in 1635 Amsterdam. I do not know when or how the speculative bubble in Bitcoin will burst, but here are a few thoughts:
1. Warren Buffet values Bitcoin at a few dollars. He likens it to a checkbook. Just because you can use it to write a check for 50K does not make the checkbook more valuable.

2. A modern economy needs a central bank and a fractional reserve banking system. Most people do not have the capital to purchase a house, or even a car. Banks making Bitcoin loans must be reserved in Bitcoin. Thus can Bitcoin be printed.

3. Bitcoin is “mined” using a cryptographic hash function. It takes about the same computing power to find a string of bits that hashes to the 256 bits that creates a Bitcoin as it does to finding new prime numbers. The advantage of the hash is that once such a number is claimed to be found it is easy to check. Very large numbers are difficult to factor so it is more difficult to verify a new prime. When you purchase a Bitcoin it is not much different from purchasing a prime number.

4. Blockchain is a useful and legitimate accounting method, but it adds no value, it merely makes it impossible to steal. Blockchain may be used to verify ownership of anything such as digital beanie babies, digital baseball cards, digital art, etc.

5. Elon Musk was caught in a stock fraud scheme a few years ago to boost (or maintain) Tesla’s share price. Musk is not who or what you think he is. Do not follow his lead.

6. The “greater fool” theory of investing: I’m going to buy this because some greater fool will pay even more in future."

16640,Bitcoin the largest scam of the century.
16641,What doesn't make sense is you can transfer crypto using stable coins which don't increase in value or decrease in value. There is no need for bitcoin. However everyone likes bitcoin because the price is going up.

16665,"Thank you for this video!! Extremely informative and so far one of the most honest and straightforward insights I’ve seen into Bitcoin. It’s a high-risk, high-reward gamble/investment, and that’s how everyone should treat it. I’m a “rookie investor” myself and am planning on investing a little bit of my own money soon (not more than I can afford to lose of course 😉), so hopefully it pays off. We’ll see!"

16678,"have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience, I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people, One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticising bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset, there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook, line and sinker and of course, those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing.  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) . Persistence and commitment and love for success is what you need in the crypto space and we all can."
16679,"The truth is that now, in the worst case scenario, Bitcoin will never go below 20/25k. Search for logarithmic regression and you understand how bitcoin works."

16684,Yeah I don’t know why you even mentioned Robinhood
16685,"I don't understand the beginning of the video how it's bad lol... 
Banks don't take any fees from transactions, let you easily access credit with your card, you get frauded they reimburse you and you have easy in person service. 
Bitcoins on the other hand (and i bought some and i'm holding it forever cuz you never know) has a withdrawl fees from most trusted blockchain at around 0.0005 which is today around 30$ fees... 
The only benefit i see from bitcoin is being able to carry (legally or illegaly) money across countries and there's a high risk of fraud if you store it in a hot wallet, and that could easily be done with a currency worth way less than bitcoin. Why make a coin worth 50k each when you can apply the same principle with an electronic coin that can be worth only 1$.."
16686,Bitcoin will become one of the world reserve currency.

16697,"Bitcoin has a huge scalability problem.It can only handle a few hundred transactions a second , where Visa /Mastercard can handle thousands of transactions a second .This is why Bitcoin has a huge problem and cannot be used as a currency ."
16698,"Today we talk about Bitcoins value in terms of the US dollar. This means it’s defacto backed by the dollar. When the dollar is gone what will we say the Bitcoin is worth? All other fiat currency is also backed by the dollar. After the dollar collapse happens so to will another event happen. Somewhere in the world someone will buy the first ounce of gold (post dollar) with Bitcoin. This will set the intrinsic vale of Bitcoin ,when dollar’s are no longer a viable comparison to value . The world is already quite aware of just how many goods and services an ounce of gold should get you. Gold will back the Bitcoin eventually. Buy gold instead."

And less than 0,001% kept it after hitting 10$. All those people feel like crap right now. Many of them probably jumped off the bridge. And Bitcoin won't be on the top for long. It's slow. At some point, another crypto will surpass it, so the smart ones will be investing in alternatives like Lite and Ethereum right now, and hold for the next 10 years regardless of the price action."

Gold is gold and is been proved that way for 5k years, BTC is a different asset.
Those predictions of BTC getting to 500 k are ridiculous if one does not point out WHEN?
BTC will be live as long as the deep state  (federal reserve) will allow it to be, and I think BTC was a product introduced by those entities.
BTC will keep going up following its movement price cycle as it was before
The most important thing to understand is that the USD as other fiat currencies are in their last stage of life. Digital currency is the present and future and certainly digital currency+blockchain is the future that will guarantee the elimination of cash and our financial freedom
Buy BTC if you are a trader and or investor, just be aware that at some point the bubble will burst. So far if you are already in BTC you may be very happy...enjoy the ride as long as it lasts
NOTE: IF YOU HAVE BTC AS ANY OTHER ASSET YOU DONT HAVE TO LOSE EVERYTHING, USE A STOP LIMIT AND THAT IS IT
Those who are saying losing all are stupid!!!!"
16732,Good video but your wrong about the past bubbles being a taste of what’s to come. The bubbles have gotten smaller over time (law of diminishing returns) when looking at % moves which you should anyway for bitcoin. If you look at the log regression bands you see that we top out 1-2 bands bellow the last each time. That does not mean it’s not a good buy. You should look at the stock to flow and metcalfe law for what’s to come. Bitcoin follows metcalfes law (just like ETH) and you can map out what the price would be for x amount of users. Stock to flow can help the same as the cycles tend to move with it and it’s why the halving has such strong effects.

Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. for the past few the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose,others are being patient...it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 6.7 BTC in just two weeks, with the help of Larry Kent their methods are top notch and profitable. Give it a try guys.

16816,"That Bitcoin vs Apple vs Gold argument is completely retarded.  Apple wasn't just an 'idea' that lucked out.  It has created and sold countless products, acquired assets, provided employment.  Gold is used in industry, jewelry, and considered a Tier 1 financial asset.  Bitcoin does absolutely nothing other than make you money if you sell it to someone willing to buy it for more than you.  Bitcoin is nowhere near the market cap of Apple and Gold because it has 'zero' reason 'to' have that kind of valuation.  You can't just SAY 'look at these other huge market caps.. bitcoin has all this room to grow to these sizes.'  For what reason?  And the 21 million = scarcity argument is equally dumb.  You don't mention that bitcoins can be split into satoshis.  ONE bitcoin = 100 MILLION satoshis.  How scarce is it if you start measuring bitcoins in satoshis?"

16844,"The secret is built into the way the exchanges operate. The price of the coins goes up and down based on supply and demand, and the supply and demand for the currencies around the world are different from one exchange to another, and because of this, often there are HUGE price differences in the same coin on different exchanges. Many people trade their crypto assets based on online predictions and they end up losing all of their money to the whales. This is not the time to gamble with your money but the time to trade with the right strategies. The market can sometimes be tricky and making good profits despite the unstable market only works with trading with accurate trading signals📉📈. I have been making massive profits off the market for about 9 months now and I have just been following the trade signals provided by Mr.Troy Henderson.

16885,6:45 secret message to buy a lot of tampons.
16886,"Bitcoin and other digital coins’ greatest asset is that (probably) they are not controlled by a corrupt entity, which seeks to create more and more to funnel funds to its secret owners while deceiving the public. How long can the “Federal” Reserve keep deceiving most Americans, when they are growing cynical of the benign motives of the Wall Street crooks? So many people keep seeing the ""Federal"" Reserve bank cartel's actions in the most false, possible light, when it was secretly created by deceiving the US congress and then president into believing that it was not sponsored by the banks nor by their ally Sen. Aldrich but created to oversee the banks better. Thereby, it has been able to transfer more and more funds in bailouts and other gifts to banksters. 

Yet, people naively keep believing that the goals of the banksters' ""Fed"" are supposedly to benefit the majority of Americans and not the banksters, which are ""coincidentally"" always the primary beneficiaries of all of its actions. See ""The Fed Now Owns Over $2 Trillion in Mortgages, What Else?"" at Thestreetd o t c o m. 

If you remove the delusion that the ""Fed"" is acting to benefit the American public, its true goal to profit the world's banksters and protect them from suffering losses is clear from its actions. See BusinessInsiderd o t c o m: “Mortgage rates have been under 3% since the summer — here's how long that might last” See “Home lenders brace for up to 15 million mortgage defaults” in the LA Times, which was written in APRIL 2, 2020. ""Shadow Housing Inventory: The Deception of the Foreclosure Numbers and the real REO Picture. A Case Study of Southern California Real Estate. How 40,000 Homes are Hidden From Public View by Banks.” in doctorhousingbubbled o t c o m.

This is a continuation of the Wall Street and bankster parasitism that has occurred for decades. See at thenewamericand o t c o m, “Federal Reserve Issues Secret Low-interest Loans to Banks.

See at thenewamericand o t c o m, “Federal Reserve Issues Secret Low-interest Loans to Banks.

Why can read about all of the secrecy and fund transfers from the deceptively named ""Fed,"" whose district banks are owned by the owners of the private banks, which own its shares, and still believe that it is benign and still looking out for most Americans? It is actually our enemy, which is there to protect and look out for the banksters even if in doing so it severely harms most Americans. The ""Fed"" will seek to regulate out of existence or destroy all these coins, which hamper its abilities to manipulate investors to give their wealth to its crony banksters."

Last time it went up 20x from it's previous highs in 2013. This is just a baby warm up to the bull run. The main bull run will come towards the end of the year. THEN it will be in a bubble. This is just a soap stud of a bubble atm

16915,Interesting....but I'll pass.
16916,"Yeah I’m not sure I agree with you, like most investments of course it can go to zero... everyone knows that going in. And in these weird times people don’t want to deal with centralized systems that they don’t trust to have their best intentions. With blockchain the people that actually use it make the changes. Also, bitcoin is much faster to transfer than funds from centralized systems. Also, bitcoin is becoming more and more scarce as time goes on and more people start to use it. Unlike paper currency there’s a limit to the amount... Unlike the fed that can just crank up the printers and make “more” (inflation). Just the way I see it as an investor/user of banks, securities, rare metals, trading cards/games, defi platforms such as Uniswap, and of Course crypto."
16917,"Bubbles are not problems!  Everything bubbles, then falls, bubbles then falls.  Why do people put scare tactics into this.  Of course it’s a bubble...how high will it go before it pops?

16956,bitcoin also have transaction fees
16957,One of the biggest market crashes was during COVID. BTC only went down to 4K. Not anywhere near zero really. It immediately after tumbling started going up eventually 400 percent. The dollar has done nothing but go down. It’s time for us all to get with the times and try something new. We don’t need an economy based on inflationary paper or a mineral in the ground. Don’t get left behind.

16981,"😂 😂 😂 YES it makes sense if you believe that the stockmarket is a investment place and not a gambling pyramid scheme.
The last decades and the reality behind the so called trillion Dollar companies is that they bought their own stocks (manipulation) so that they can grab the bonuses!

17002,"The weird thing about bitcoin (and probably most cryptocurrencies) is the most common way to acquire it is through exchanges and brokers (who have fees).

17008,Check out “AMC” & “NOK”
17009,Should i buy Bitcoin now and invest?
17010,"It is a simple story of supply and demand, or more specifically the halfing of bitcoin mining causes a staggered bull run. Miners sell coins as fast as they get them creating a consistent sell pressure, but when this is cut in half that consistent sell pressure takes a consistent drop. First in the days and weeks before the hafling miners will stop selling  some coins they mint and start holding a percentage. For weeks or months after the halfing the horded coins will supplement the sell pressure they can create with newly minted coins. Well this is happening interest is building up around the raising value and starts to increase buy pressure. Finally the miners and speculators run out of horded coins at the same time interest is peaking resulting in the price spike we saw in December. The thing that is different this time is there are not many spectacular looking places to move your bitcoin earnings into, and major institutions are jumping on board to further increase interest and buying pressure."
17011,"The biggest fallacy and false narrative is the ideology that there are only 21 million Bitcoins. True, but there is NO limit to the Bitcoin versions one can create after that i.e. Bitcoin 2.0, Bitcoin 3.0, etc. All with no limit to the addotional coin base creation behind the versions.....30 million, 40 million. 50 million, etc
Sooner or later this realization will come to fruition based on greed, control and power just like fiat currrency."

17019,"call ""financial vertigo"". When the price of a stock (in this case the bitcoin as a risk investment), goes strongly high in a short time, you start to feel can crash at any second. This happens especially because you are just a point in the system and cannot control what other ""whales"" or investment companies can do to move the price and win money, so you believe this stock will go up but you are always with the fear of losing all.
The problem with the bitcoin is that 99% of the coins are in hands of the 0,00000001% of the holders. All other 1% of the coins are in hands of the 99,999999999% of the users, like you, me, my neighbor, etc.. so basically is a coin totally controlled by very very few wallets in the world."

So, I think this satifies the question how good it is. If that's not enough, it has gathered 10 M pioneers in meager 1year and 8 months time . You can now understand how it has penetrated in peoples' minds.

As it is just in phase 2 (of 3 phases) it's kinda too early to put a price tag, but one thing seems sure to me, this has set a platform, Pi is going to be next part in evolution of currency, the digital currency. So, mining as much as possible while you can is a wise thing to do, use code   (marini1) DOWNLOAD from Play store or AppStore."

17034,"Three reasons why bitcoin will never drop below $20,000 again!
1. Institutions are demanding more and more bitcoin, they are buying for the long term. This means they won't sell anytime soon.
2. We just went through a halving which means the amount of mined bitcoin every day is now cut in half.
 This is good for the price because the demand is increasing while the supply is lowering.
3. With all these institutions buying bitcoin it is certain that bitcoin price will never go below $20K again."

17062,"Aye, cutout the middle man and lose 20% of asset total supply. Forget or loose password and lose all. Missclick one freaking number in adress and boom uou loose agin now. Nothing of that is possible with exsisting banks, unless you have fund in banks or could tell where you’v got it."
17063,"This is a pretty good video, although its not cover the complete picture of what exactly #bitcoin is!"
17064,Current BTC prices are more related to big companies investing rather than people hype..therefore big crash will probably not happen since big companies hold their assets for a long time and do not day trade..I have zero worries for Bitcoin...I will buy until I die!!
17065,"Bitcoin is a bubble but it's still possible to make money on bubbles, the trick is to sell just-in-time."
17066,Bitcoin will collapse global financial market. Undoubtedly.
17067,"Comparing BTC with Apple or GOLD is like comparing online rummy or poker games , with football or Cricket industry. there is a old saying goes "" A fool is the man, who knows the price of everything, but value of nothing "".  Just because dollar is losing value, doesn't means every other country is fool to remove the gold standard and go to printing spree. doesn't mean you can live inside a computer algorithm or eat virtual reality."
17068,"The EU is starting to talk about laws for cryto. Blockchain is here to stay, but not sure about crypto."

17079,"Just added to my bag of WISE, im thinking $10 in 2021"
17080,Just bought the dip on $WISE i think it will do big things in 2021
17081,"I think we can drop the ""low tx fees"" argument for crypto now at least for Bitcoin and especially ethereum. I'll pay $1 to my bank for that e-transfer any day rather than $50 for one smart contract interaction on price gouging eth. Bitcoin not as bad as eth granted."
17082,they are both right we are going to 100k to 200k before a pullback back down to 40k.   sell at the top and buy back in at the bottom is my plan
17083,Nobody needs to know what BTC is.
17084,bull theses.... was that meant to sound like bull feces... bullshit? cuz i see what ya did there!
17085,I just got $2000 with just $250 from Goldvendor10 on telegram through the credit card i got from and i brought bitcoin with it..thanks a lot sir
17086,Bitcoin can never go to zero because there are lost bitcoins that add to the market value.
17087,The Chinese IT genious tiLui has wrote an algorithm that can access each individual block in Blockchain. He is currently co-operating with the Chinese government on making another currency on Chinese which is related to blockchain but a lot safer. Be aware everything can be programmed in the computer science field. Dont Invest on something you don't understand!!!!
17088,"Bitcoin is nothing more than encrypted electrons sitting on peoples’ memory devices.  I find it incredible that there’s any value in it.  Unless a company goes out of business its stock is worth something.  But if, and it’s a ginormous if, there’s a situation where people need to cash out of Bitcoin the residual value is zero. Zero!"
17089,"This bubble is slightly different in pattern from the previous, plus it has institutional investors primarily right now. This might alter it.

You can diversify your portfolio to minimize the risk. Look for a project with a lot of growth potential. If you want, look into XSN if you want to invest in a coin that has yet to pump. It gets listed on a top-tier exchange like Bitfinex. And it's building the first instantly tradeable DEX in the world. Meaning you can trade BTC + ETH instantly (will feel like trading on Binance)."
17090,Good strategy indeed! I also have a bit of bitcoin on the side. But one of the reasons I'm sceptical is the high environmental cost of mining them.
17091,"Bitcoin is terrible as a currency.  Bitcoin can only handle 5 transactions per second while VISA can handle 1700 transactions per second.  

As a commodity I guess Bitcoin is ok."
17092,If Bitcoin is volotaile and borderline a speculative asset...what about paper Gold? Without the possess of physical Gold. A topic you might look too.
17093,Good job!
17094,Mind you governments will NEVER let someone taking away from them the money printing monopoly. In worst case the use of crypto currencies will be forbidden by law.
17095,*The Problem With The 50 Year Fiat Bubble...*
17096,"This doesn't go into the issue of why bitcoin might not ever be adopted: 1) it's not a stable value, 2) it takes 15 to 30 minutes to execute a transaction.  Are you going to wait 30 minutes at a cash register before you can leave with whatever you're purchasing? 3) it's a pain in the ass to purchase and people don't want to deal with the hassle of acquiring a wallet and exchanging existing currency into Bitcoin.  4)  There's a risk of losing all your money either by losing your physical wallet or by a hacker getting your money stored somewhere else.  I really hope that Bitcoin could overtake the BS fiat currencies that governments are inflating by the minute.  But I don't see that happening anytime soon."
17097,"I can’t force you to make an investment in crypto,this was exactly what happened last year when bitcoin had price reduction,I really appreciate my portfolio manager for given the best advice no one has ever given me,she made me understand that crypto is the best investment on can make when you are guided by a professional portfolio manager."

17104,"Interesting video. Some counter-arguments to the points you made:

1) Bitcoin has a finite value of 21M coins. Yes - for now. There can only ever be so many coins in existence, and what happens once most of those are owned? Bitcoin is a deflating currency, no one would ever sell it when it will just go up in value. Once it becomes hard to buy bitcoin, there will be extreme temptation on the part of brokers to modify the software to create more bitcoin (and essentially print more money) so that the market can keep liquid and profits continue.

2) Bitcoin is not the revolutionary technology. *Blockchain* is. Nothing theoretically stops big finance from developing their own currencies based on this technology and displacing Bitcoin as the ""market leader"". In fact, major institutions are already working on this. Bitcoin is valuable currently simply because it's the most *widely adopted* crypto, but nothing makes it innately better than any of the other coins."

Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset. Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, some hodlers may be happy at the moment due to the rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts.

17141,"1st the bear argument is completely false. (I know it's not your argument you're just saying what other people are saying)
The latest run was not made bc of clueless investores like ourselfs, it was made by big institutions buying bitcoin.
A better argument would be, since the value lies in the blockchain and not in the bitcoin itself, bitcoin has no value. 
Bank have recieved a green light to use blockchain technology. This will bump up the rate of deposit yields since bank have basically no fees with cryto. If you recieve more money in a bank savings account why should you buy a bitcoin ?
2nd printing money itself does not cause inflation (money is not backed by gold but it's backed by demand)
If there were no demand, money would not be printed. They can't just print what they want. They're only able to print what they need. If you look at the money that has been printed in Europe after the financial crisis (2007-2008), you'll realize that it has 3x, meanwhile the inflation rate has not 3xed.
There is no linear relation between Inflation and Printing. 
There is a linear relation between the value of assets that are being purchased with such money. In other words, If you buy junk with your money, your money will be worth junk."
17142,XRP is the one. Wait till the Tether lawsuit and KYC government requirements crush BTC. LOL. It's coming and the EU has already kicked off that agenda. Never listen to Twitter. Never trust smart money on TV either. They will lie and tell you the exact opposite of what they are doing. No rich man wants more competition. Free advise from the rich is disinfo. Do the research.

Bitcoin soared about 200% last year. Institutional interest has led to this buoyancy. Rising inflation and increasingly negative views of modern monetary policy are forcing investors to look for alternative ways to preserve the value of their capital. There is no better time to accumulate and stack up because soon enough the price of bitcoin will skyrocket to the moon, there are two approaches to increasing your portfolio as an investor first is by buying little bits of crypto periodically (DCA) and the second which is a preferred and a better option is trading because it is less capital intensive and more profitable.

The only way it will work when the govts decide to use their own digital currency whose price is regulated - even that will not happen bcos the powerful banks will not allow it to happen.

17198,The Crypto market has proved to be profitable over time but it all depends on your choice of investment. Investing  wrongly might have you ending up with losses and no one wants that

17200,"When I came across all this testimonies I thought they were bots and all made up till I was convinced And honestly I don’t regret the move I made because I invested my savings.
I’ve not stopped thanking my Aunt who got me introduced to him"

17202,So Nice 💘💘💘💘💘💘
17203,The exuberance is getting crazier 😱
17204,"Bitcoin is currently aiming higher for a more solidified price as expected by many before the year runs out, with bulls now aiming at sending the cryptocurrency up towards $37,000 following the recent break below this level. That's why people who are new in the market always panic daily over the charts, it's a never-ending road if we are being honest. Well as for me, it's always been no pressure ever since I ventured into the crypto community, purchased over 5 Btc in 2017 which I saved until 2020 before switching to Tra dlng the currency. I will always advlse anyone who just started dealing with bitcoin or old holders, Trad e people! It's truly easy, only requires your time. I registered with a mentoring firm on Te.leqram mssngr who helped me grow my crypto portfoIio all the way to 17 Btc in a year. @profryan on Te.leqram or ryanjackson5501@gmailcom  made my year."
17205,"Stock’s are crashing, bitcoin investment Right now will be at every wise individuals list ,in a month you will be ecstatic with the decision you made today"
17206,"The problems with BTC are
* it is an intangible asset of no physical use 
* Not backed by any govt
* Security threat is always there 
* It is like collectable item which is purely sentiment driven than a asset backed value driven"
17207,"Bitcoin has been a great speculative investment in the past and as said in the video, there weren't probably too many people investing in bitcoin in 2013. Past performance, however, shouldn't be supposed to predict future performance. Also with Apple and other corporations, they produce something of value and generate enormous amounts of cash. Unlike bitcoin which like gold is speculative air-asset without intrinsic value."
17208,Nice explanation and great effort❤️🔥💕
17209,"I tried to warn people many times, but they just won't listen. They're so ignorant, arrogant and obstinated. Maybe they deserve what is coming to them."
17210,"I am bullish on Bitcoin long term, but I can't get over the technical limitations on transactions per second and speed. Bitcoin is very archaic in terms of scaling compared to most competitive alt coins and even Ethereum."

17222,"*COMPLIMENTS* to a Bullish season Lol!! Most people don't understand the Concept of  *""Buying the Dip""*. Buying the Dip is all about Buying digital Assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rise. Holding is Profitable, although Trading is far more Profitable. I was able to grasp the Knowledge of Trading Crypto Assets early enough, but I was still Limited due to my lack of Technical Understanding on how to Analyze the Digital Market, all that changed when I Encountered *Dr Catherine Ruth's* Services. 
Although, I have been into Numerous Services but *Dr Catherine* stands out with Experience and Expertise playing in her Favor. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the Routes to trading but with the Guidance and Assistance of *Dr Catherine* it was much more easy to understand and right now I proudly boast of turning my *$9000* into *$87000* in less than One month and I'm still earning passively and steadily increasing my Portfolio, You can reach *Dr Catherine* personally on WhatsApp and Email for proper Guidance on your Journey to Financial Freedom!
Remember, a Bullish market is Reversed Bearish Market.

17236,people were going crazy about tesla selling bitcoin so i looked and bam.. they only sold 10% of their holding. i mean come on. even etf and institutions are selling 10-20% of specific shares here and there so wtf is the big deal tesla selling only 10% of their total holding of bitcoin? why do people make it sound like they sold all bitcoin and completely got out of it? this is just ridiculous. it's only 10%.. so stupid.

17238,Is Bitcoin investment is good in 2021
17239,Dude...you killing us with intros!!!!!
17240,"cool!! thank you.. I don't think Elon Musk, pumped BTC, he has pumped Doge but, who knows if he owns any.. but, the people are the ones that decide if they buy or not.. I think it's healthy for people to take profit.. what's the point on buying everything that you can NEVER EVER sell? that makes no sense... HOLD for sure but, if you need to take profit than take it... there are coins/tokens that are not meant to be hold for long term unless you like the project and support whatever it is that you searched. I have a few that is short term and some are long term holds, EVERYONE works like that.! anyhow, thank you for the information"
17241,20 years from now you will have no need to cash your bitcoin for fiat.

In my opinion, we are already post-dollar and anybody smart enough to be buying crypto and learning about blockchain technology shouldn't be thinking in terms of dollars at all.  BTW, I don't waste my time grumping at people I don't respect.  Your website, twitter page, and youtube channel all have the best information on the subject - bar none."

Or we are in a new Everlasting phase where all of the projects that show promise continue to build on their promises and become better Financial tools than the banks ever could. Cryptocurrencies could never end up dying and Fiat currencies will just have to live next to cryptos. All the new deflationary measures put on new and existing cryptos to help drive price actions also got me going crazy.

17278,Why Tesla doesn't convert their Bitcoin to Doge since Musk seems to like that shitcoin more.
17279,it does seem like it’s Adam Back who’s satoshi. Unfortunately sometimes the most obvious person is often the correct. he runs blockstream which is basically the single handed bitcoin developer. he controlled the small blockers. “satoshi” came out in favour of the small blockers. plus everything else that lines up in Barely Sociable’s video

17708,This is an excellent tutorial on how to HFSP.
17709,"Well explained .BTChits another bearish cost as individuals expanded their offers in order to make immense addition from the ascent however as we would all be able to see now the market is truly insecure , truly you can generally make more benefit from tradn instead of just hodlin and sitting tight at the cost of BTCto soar . Surely its an extreme choice for both old and beginners whose intensions are simply to hodl and sell yet rather the possibilities of tradnBtc would permit you develop yourBtc not disapproving of the current value graph and furthermore saving your butt from any future profound that may happen . I began tradn with Machael Graham since toward the end of last year and till date have made over 16Btc even with the high points and low points since the excursion. With Michael's assistance I presently don't need to stress over the ascent and plunge ofBitcoin, you can without much of a stretch get to Michael on Եҽlҽցɾαต (@michaelgrahamfx* ) for any Crypot related issue."
17710,Great video Alain!
17711,"I agree - the prior 2017 cycle had multiple 30% corrections on its route to 20K - what we have just seen is nothing out of the ordinary and is actually a positive one. All the RSI metrics reset, weak traders have been flushed out, the market is deleveraged, fear and greed has dropped to quite a low. This is a great foundation on which the next upswing can be built - the BTC bull market ending now after it has only just broken through the last ATH (for 3-4 months) makes very little sense. According to cycles we should anticipate at least another 4-12 months of bullish price action.  I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to a well known Juliana Victoria in the cryptospace  who trained me as my initial start up Cap was multiplied by 5 In two months. After getting in touch with her, she showed me how to use their program to make transactions and got I7 btc in 3 moths. if you are looking for a way to increase your portfolio or investment. She can be reached on Ꭲ  Ꭼ  Ꮮ  Ꭼ  Ꮆ  Ꮢ 𐋎 Ꮇ @ Julianavico Cheers."

17726,"I wouldve sold about 75% of the bitcoin instead of all of it if I felt that way about BTC. Use the 25% left to see what it does. I did that with BNB. Bought at $12, in 2018, sold most when it hit $130.it's now $670 so glad I hodl."
17727,"Nice contents you put up always👌.BTChits a new bullish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see now the market is very unstable , the truth is that you can always make more profit from tradln rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of BTCto skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newb!es whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradln. I wept deeply and prayed after the last time i had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to an expert Dr. Bernard Theo  who i started tradln with since late last year,i've covered up and made over 21 B T С with 2 B T C even with the ups and downs since the journey .

17737,"Good  points made,but looking at it from a certain perspective when it comes to the  mother of all coins < B  TC >, nobody knows where it will go, Surely I wouldn’t invest in it as a retirement asset, I don’t think it will ever replace fiat (Both because of its limited availability also because it would take generations to do that)and most of all because now at (almost) All-time highs, is in my opinion not the best moment to enter..
Nevertheless I’m happy I enter`d sometime ago and I’m holding.. None has  had a  clear  crystal ball in my humble opinion, most people just talk about B TC, which is just the tip of the iceberg, I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. B  TC is the future doesn’t mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. I advice that we all follow a less talked about way which is trad!ng. I was able to generate more than 8 B TC with 1. 4 B TC in an interval of 6 weeks from using the tradё signal of Koroush Ak . he can be reached via   Te l e g r am @KoroushAk1 for  more insights >...."

 is that you can always make more profit from tradn rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of 
BT C to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl 
and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price 
chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started trad!n with Tayler Samm I 
no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin , you can easily reach on tele ; grm  at

17746,"It’s really mind boggling that Bitcoin has major ties in China, that was very concerning to me from the get go , but I found a comfort level when I saw Michael Saylor , Raul Pal and others in big biz loading up on BTC , figured , these guys are obviously not fools ... Like every other market, if there’s a way to be manipulated, it will be, just finding it fascinating, yet again, that when people find a decentralized monetary vehicle to break away from govt / mainstream, it will just happen to have ties to a Communist country like China, that is likely America’s greatest enemy right now, other than our own govt itself, Lol ...
I do believe crypto is here to stay, but unless China changes like Russia did years ago, there will eventually be a pivot away from Bitcoin to many others with great technological use cases, in my humble opinion...

17948,"Anyone who is blaming bitboy for his loss think again all that mean is u don’t do your own research, eth is struggling with scalability with the constant demand its getting slower and slower , gas fees is in all time high main defi project in eth are considering getting help from others competitors such as sushiswap wants to integrate with solana one of the fastest blockchain in the space , solana is extremely undervalued it has the features that ada and eth both only dreams of having , 1inch want to use binnance smart chain. And this is hurting eth badly, i think selling eth and adopt to the new technologies is a smart decision untill eth find a solution my advice is don’t get emotionally involve with the project."
17949,The institutional migration is beginning already from BTC into ADA
17950,"The Bit coin mar:ket is experiencing a fierce correction as many institutional investors are entering with a buy-and-hodl mentality given their understanding of Bit coin as dig!tal gold. I think that will be beneficial for Bit coin in the long run; making now the right time to stack up more Bit coin by tradn the asset.

Who would ? Charles Hoskinson is respected they will invest in him as well as ADA."
17960,Put all your ETH and BTC into ADA
17961,Funny how people always buy dogs that look like their owners.
17962,"well its got down and the setiment seems good, we could use some indictors but BUY NOW"
17963,"interesting that exchanges are part of the mining pool strategy - seems they must be wanting dumps too as they are running out of Bitcoin, it works for them to build up reserves"

17968,Shorting in a bull market sounds like suicide (unless you know something we all don't)

17970,"What the charts are showing me (I could be wrong), from the red wick on February 25th on the 4h chart (based on the spider trendline technique): -17.28% @ 42599, -28.19% @ 36,979, -30.58% @ 35, 751.5 & -38.66% @ 31, 588.5.

17978,Buy the dip with your unlimited cash reserve
17979,The chinese govt do not wast competition for their own digital currency  thewill attempt to destroy Btc in offer to make the yuan the new world reserve currency in place of the dollar. We all know  it’s already game over for the dollar but the cccp didn’t bank on Btc  becoming adopted by the global institutions  before the yuan had full global exposure. The only hope is for  a couple of  national  governments to put BTC  PUBLICLY into   their  reserves.  even better  if they start strategically mining   Just a thought   Ps all businesses  in China are government controlled  that includes the Btc miners
17980,buybit to the uk?
17981,Super glad I found your Channel finally someone calling his people out
17982,"on the reels....Ben Armweak is not a reel trader. It is fun to watch his channel , but it is not professional advice. You cannot blame him for your trades. I watched on one of his vids where he put half a million dollars on ADA. Smart trade, where is ADA now in this downswing? Exactly."
17983,This guy and his clickbait titles are NOT good for crypto. He so reeks of used car salesman.

18015,"I am no crypto expert at all. As a regular guy with a bit of knowledge of how supply & demand can be manipulated, to advantage a few, I have always had this thought that crypto is no different. It's a whole new asset class than the traditional asset classes for sure. But money goes in and out. Bitcoin will definitely hit very high values in times to come. That too will be manipulated I am sure. Remember that China did not become the economic power it is today, without Globalist Zionist meddling. China has been set up since the early 70's for exactly this day & age very cunningly by currency controllers. China is just a useful instrument in the hands of the few who controls the globe. How will the few get us all into their coming CEFI digital currencies? Destroy the DEFI system. May make loads of profit before everything implodes,and  form parallel sustainable economies outside the Zionist Globalist matrix."
18016,COTI is one to keep an eye on as holy smokes COTI has an insane roadmap ahead.
18017,"Should've sold ETH at 2000, because it's gonna dump hard after Cardano mainet launch.

EDIT: Word on the street in China is that the government is considering regulations or an imminent ban, hence why insiders that hold a lot of BTC are dumping."

18054,"I don't say this as an XRP maximalist, it just happens to be true. The money has has been sucked up by bitcoin and the crap coins and now their selling. This money will now sit on the sidelines until the time comes to inject it into the real utility projects principle amongst them XRP. A lawsuit settlement is close and the outcome will be favourable for XRP. Watch the price of XRP dump before a massive   rise. Of course this will happen before a the settlement is announced."
18055,Whines about f2pool selling. Rants against derivatives in other vids. Considers shorting the market. Such a hypocrit!
18056,"This guys a fraud, eth 2500 by v day. Smh"
18057,"Why are Americans so obsessed with china. Other Countries in the world mine bitcoins,  Netherlands Amsterdam, Iceland and Canada, America Washington DC, and they all look out for themselves. So blaming china alone is very one-sided. And you have no proof. You sound like trump more and more every day. When cryptocurrency flying and bitcoin at ATH no one complains. Stop being a big baby and let the process play out."

18062,This dude is always wrong lmao
18063,Can someone explain like I'm a ten year old what shorting is please?
18064,this is what i was thinking. we are under chinise miners. if miners want to dump on us whenever they want we fucked up. we have to find other crypto like btc that is not owning by fucking chinise miners
18065,"don't understand. china miners are allowed to dump if they want no?  let us make a video on who are the bastard hod'ling bitcoin and causing the price to rise.  china is as communist as USA... bitcoin was born due to collusion between gov and banks. there would be no bitcoin is USA was a true capitalist country. they would not have been ""too big to fail"" in 2008. I am struggling to understand you. you sound anti china."

I can say i have had my fair share of loses over the years i made loses to the extent that I almost quit. Until late last year when i was introduced to an Expt. David B.

18094,"So, Chinese are behind this dump?"
18095,He predicted ETH to be $2.5k by valentine and it didn't happen; listen but don't believe everything he says.
18096,"Ofc it is bearish, BTC is at 860B market cap. People are selling and taking profit, who knows when will stop."
18097,What's the Problem about Shorts term dips caused by whoever as long as ut didn't Interferenzen with the long time predictions you gave hours ago?
18098,The thing we always must remember is mining pools want the price to go up eventually
18099,"No one knows what the f-ing price is going to do...if anyone did, they wouldn't have to work...or spend all their time making youtube videos. It's the same in every market, at every blackjack table,  at every horse track...if anyone actually knew, they wouldn't have to work...and they certainly wouldn't tell anyone else about it. Yes, it really is that simple. That said, BTC has appreciated every single year since it's inception, and likely will continue to..."

18104,$45k support
18105,"The sharp recovery in major altcoins and Bit: zion suggests the uptrend remains intact. Although the bears tried to start a correction today, the long tail on the day's candlestick suggests the bulls are in no fashion to relent. If the bulls can sustain the buying pressure and push the price above $ 50k, the BTCpair may witness a short squeeze that could quickly propel the price to $ 60k. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I'm not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s! Gnals from Patrick. he runs program for investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trad! ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin.

18108,"Thank you. Great times. I will be buying  this for me is fantastic. I came in late so a second chance. We all have to remember most crypto is the result of work done like digging gold and silver. The institutional money is the foundation wherever that settles. Remember where else can mums and dads and the big boys play in a free market ? The next run will sit us on our arse so keep your powder ready for some excellent once in a life time oppertunity. Good luck   dont borrow , what you have will do. Cheers."

They don't even have to fear backlash from the western gouvernments because these don't really like the cryptomarket either if its not controlled by the central banks.

The simple fact is this chud is guessing AT BEST and should not be relied upon for any decent advice. Do your own research, read your own charts. Cons like this, Ivan, and most of the other crypto channels are just part of a racket of people that can barely read a wave chart let alone predict what's going to happen with crypto in 6 months."

There must be some way where Bitcoin can no longer affect the whole market. Maybe some genius can create a new crypto currency that cannot be manipulated. Shieldcoin would be a great name to keep the market balanced and healthy. Otherwise, bull runs and bear runs will always be dump runs.

18294,"I don't want to hurt the Bull run but China owns Bitcoin. If they wanted to do a 51% attack they could, but it would destroy the value of Bitcoin. China won't do this because they own too much Bitcoin unless... they sell it all off... 🤔 (that's what these dumps are about) And if Bitcoin becomes valueless they could switch all their mining hardware to do this to Litecoin or Bitcoin cash ect. The only hope we really have for a true decentralized cryptocurrency is a project like NIMIQ. You and altcoin daily turned me on to it during your interview with them. My portfolio is 55% Cardano and 45% NIMIQ. I'M NOT HOLDING ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S TRULY VALUELESS. 🤷‍♂️ However I'm a massive believer in cryptocurrency and its future to dominate finance and the entire internet. ✊ Long live the open source!"

18321,"Maybe the whales who were long on the futures fell short of their price prediction and did not expect the price of BTC to go beyond 50k. Michael Saylor's conference happened after the renewal of the futures contract so they were not able to factor in the positive impact of the conference relative to their forecast.

Futures contract will expire on Friday 4 pm London time or 11 am Eastern time. I expect more dumps up to the last minute to ensure that the price of bitcoin stays below 50k. After that, the price of bitcoin will blast to the moon."

18355,"The price dump, or the F2pool selling has nothing to do with Chinese government. If anything, US gov, US Federal Reserve and Treasury, they are the biggest enemy of crypto.

18357,"So at some point the first pool won't be dumping ,for 2 reasons 1 the lack of volume ,2 would they dump at a price substantially lower than what btc price hit???"
18358,ADA and MATIC is sacing my ass right now... Or id be down so bad
18359,Totally agree with your video but I’m gonna say something... China ain’t communist. They’re ultra capitalist . The entire economy and life model is about that right now. The difference it’s that China is a country with government control on hardcore mode with different moral standards :)
18360,YouTube will silence the president but can't get rid these annoying hacking bots commenting on every comment. hysterical
18361,Isn’t it more important who’s buying? Which appears to be American business. If they are selling then they are loosing market and power. They can only sell so much.

18369,ADADADADA
18370,It went up to fast. Then it's not a dump
18371,Thumbs downing for clickbait
18372,Bro U dont know shit about TA and the fact that you advocate shorting bitcoin makes you a traitor. If you connect all the recent tops with a line you can see the new resistance that we jest now bounced off
18373,"Big fan of Bit Boy but I’m wondering when he will realize that when traditional stocks have a bad day it drags Bitcoin down as well? I’d like to see Bit Boy crypto tie that into their analysis. He talks like a traditional stock collapse wouldn’t affect BTC, when others say that would effectively end the bull market"

18382,"New World Order just around the Corner, It's almost dumb not to hold any decentralized currency such as bitcoin I'm sure you don't want to miss out on the best investment/plan of the last decade, partaking in infusing on Bitcoin is not only a good decision but also one of the best and reliable investment to ingest in, or are you afraid you don't know how to trade you can buy at low cost and sell at a very splendid price with the help of a good crypto expert and analyst sometimes Fear, uncertainty, and doubt cause volatility to spike, but that doesn't mean you had bad luck. Moreover, Bitcoin is impaling even higher ,with the help price action strategy I was able to increase my portfolio from just in just couple of trades of using , if know you are interested, newbie or will like to increase your portfolio you can reach mrs Amelia Paul on Telegram >> @Ameliatrades1 Goodluck! lets make the best of whatever"

18385,"Love the channel and your work! Just thinking out loud here, but what if BTC is a commie plot to draw in the whole world and then all these Chinese miners which are owned by the CCP pull the plug and cause BTC to go to zero? They’d wreck the whole world and thus could take over. Admittedly, kind of far fetched but want to put it out there. Cheers!"

Everyone knows btc will is not going anywhere it will grow and grow 😎"
18389,"Bitcoin price just finally blasted well above 50K for the first time in history. With the leading cryptocurrency by market cap having no clear resistance above it, it has now entered price discovery mode, and where to next is anyone's guess. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I'm not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s! Gnals from benpaul . He runs programs for investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trad! ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin.

18392,4 hours ago you said bitcoin to 306k soooooooo............LOL
18393,Bitcon is a security as the profits and price relies heavily on the success and selling at the Mining pools
18394,"It's been execpected I have buys set in at 42, 40 and 38 .... But our bottom main trend line is around 37k"
18395,Ethreum to 2.5 k in feb
18396,Please don't do the video thumbnail stupid face thing. You're better than that.
18397,"He KEEPS SAYING.   """""" I'LL BE HONEST!!!!"""" YOU KNOW HES PATHETIC LIAR"
18398,BitBoy can speculate with the best of them! 95% of his subscribers are noobs and believe everything he says lol
18399,Bens wife sure has a lot of books 😂
18400,Sell time
18401,I'm ok cuz I'm all in on ada
18402,Fuf2
18403,Can we see your High School Diploma please?
18404,Alright here I'll say it. Btc was invented because we got tired of the big banks and corperations minipulations of stocks and gold etc. What do we do ? All cheer when they buy and make big corperations and get together with all the same folks that were shoving it way up whare the sun dont shine....... Back to square one. Should have kept the banks out. There I said it
18405,"It makes total sense, you have to wonder who is controlling alot of this if it is being controlled by one entity as i think co-incidence is a complete load of crap"
18406,I would love to see you on Tim Pool’s show.
18407,So glad I set a stop loss
18408,Now the whales will hear ADA saved too many people and will attack ADA to scoop the rest
18409,"Great update Ben. I know exactly what you mean when your talking about more going on here than it seems. But yes, your right. All BTC mining pools in China are in fact under the direct control of the CCP. Lol! Just spit it out Ben! Lol!"
18410,"Way too much good news from companies buying, etc. for it to fall much farter. Not everyone is in love with a 1.5% bond yield."
18411,I'm in long
18412,Long at $48K and consider short at $46K. What could have developed in 2 hours that would arrive at that ?
18413,Its profit taking and they trying to bring it lower its hard to buy a dip that hi.holding its your money.what i would do is convert one coin to polkadot and hold.its up to the big boys what they do.21mil compared to ten mil.whats more rear.
18414,ADA about to kill the game very soon.
18415,"My liq. Price on eth trade is 1080 , should i be worried ?"
18416,If this is coordinated...then where is the idea that decentralization helps keep this a savings platform?? Satochi in his great wisdom forgot one of human's greatest flaws ....greed
18417,I think we are looking at this the wrong way. F2pool is doing us a service by dropping btc's price. We can get cheaper BTC. altcoins and it's keeping BTC from overheating and ending this bullrun early. USA needs to buy BTC just like most of the smart money in this country is doing... Keep China from 51% attacks
18418,Oh well I bought all my bitcoin with money I won on Chinese slots at Hollywood Gaming 😃 and tomorrow when I go to the bank and deposit what I won today I’m gonna buy somemore  LoL!!!
18419,Bitcoin will go wherever the manipulators want it to go. You wanted all of the manipulators from the major institutions to buy in and they have. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are just a big casino.
18420,You guys look alike.
18421,"lol, this man steals content from cryptos r us"
18422,F2 pool dumped 5000btc
18423,Dog and owner = match 👍🏼
18424,Let’s rally a WSB style movement... this is getting too much
18425,"smell u in 6 months buddy, when US economy collapses"
18426,Everyone gave me crap about Vechain being a Chinese coin. Well guess what? Bitcoin is also.
18427,"I love that people watch Bitboy and than bitch that he's wrong, like F off creeps"
18428,Jesus there channels are becoming a bit too much for me.
18429,Sux when miners dump that's their job though ppl take profit mining takes money how much do you actually make when you sell a Bitcoin you mine there's a lot of electricity it's the same thing with gold miners control a lot
18430,Don’t short!
18431,"Doesn't this dump you speak of defeat the ideal of having a trustless network? How can these dumps stop if the blockchain protects their identities? In the long run, the price of Bitcoin will keep rising. However, it doesn't give a fair opportunity to all. Nothing wrong with the computers, sadly it's the humans who are operating them."
18432,should we load up on (CRV)CURVE DAO?  The all-time-high is $54.00 and right now its only $2.00. Once Defi season kicks into high gear the price should pump due to new partnership with Polkadot and YFI
18433,Be greedy guys. Hold fast.
18434,$GRT  the future of Web3
18435,This drop started about 15 hours ago...

18439,"great video keep up the good work.

18446,"I'm officially predicting... if F2 keeps this up, we will see a large drop in the btc dominance chart. People will get tired of the manipulation, eventually boycott in part and alts will reach a level of dominance. Rightly so."
18447,"If you see the graph level of market, mostly down except Ada and Dogecoin"
18448,It should be back in 20k!
18449,Ben got tekt again
18450,"You have a scam advert as the intro to your show dude. If you can locate who the advert belongs to,  you can help close down the scam they are advertising so they cannot continue and perhaps even get caught.  Its one of the worst scams on youtube because it is presented so professionally. It's even using footage of Vitalic Buterin  to promote the scam...."
18451,Right now is at 47
18452,"Ben was really real with the Crypto Crow about what a shirtcoin Ethereum is.  Big props to Bit Boy.  However, if you listen to any day trader including Bit Boy you will get crushed in a highly manipulated market."
18453,Once bitcoin dominance drops its Alt season baby! Well atleast If you Hodl Cardano 🤣
18454,"As soon as you tweeted the blood diamond, I made sure I was in stable coins. Going to average back in when things cool off. Thanks for all you do, brother!"
18455,My charts are telling me I need another coors light
18456,Nice clickbait. These fuddy titles for the videos seriously are not helping
18457,I’m in it for the long haul.  I’m holding firm.

18459,Proof Market Cypher is BS!

18461,I think you may be correct with 38k.  Love your channel. Go Short
18462,"Love the info... but i cant stand the silly faces everyone has on their thumbnails when a dump/price drop is happening. Makes me more mad than the price drop itself. Either way, keep rocking on bitboy"

18465,So no more moon videos bitboy.....lol
18466,"So far nothing this dude says has happened and he is making money off his viewers , no one knows where this shit is actually going"
18467,Are you saying the Chinese own half of the bitcoins? 😧👹
18468,"Bitboy, dont copy Mmcrypto with that thumbnail, we love you"
18469,If bitboy gets banned it's because china joe was told by daddy xi to do it.
18470,SO we like OMI
18471,ANOTHER STIMULUS VOTE TOMORROW MONEY PRINTER GO BRRRRRRRRR
18472,Lol they always say dogs look like their owners 😂
18473,Ethereum is a hedge against Cardano.
18474,Have you considered the possibility of a self fulfilling prophecy.  That these things (like this video) generate fear (or the greed of potential opportunity to sell and buy back cheaper) which creates the selling that actually cause the dip... Just a thought.
18475,"Bro.. Drop the stupid face thumbnail theatrics that all others use, it makes you look desperate. You are better than that, much love"
18476,im in so early on all this shit that im still up LMAO
18477,I really have lost trust in this channel. But at least there is some honesty
18478,I’m holding!
18479,"I thought the same thing when watching Crypto Daily's vid (love that guy; his vids are the highlight of my days). The likely hood that thousands of individual minors from f2pool all sell on the same hour is pushing it. In the same day at a ATH? Sure; it can happen. Obviously there's gonna be a lot of sellers on ATH days. But that much from 1 pool in 1 hour? That shit reeks of coordinated efforts. Especially dumps like just now where we weren't even at a top. I haven't looked at any outflows for tonight (and don't have the access to one), but if they were all dumping right now? That's definite evidence of manipulation. There's no way a shit-ton of random minors would have just dumped at the same time when we weren't even back up to that 57-58 mark yet. Also, I heard somewhere that buyers are paying premiums for coins without any transaction history. This might be why they're not even bothering with dollar-cost-averaging out. They might be getting higher bids for them freshly minted stacks so aren't concerned with the current selling price. Just something to think about."
18480,@zaincrypto on telegram Get touch with him he's the best 🤝
18481,So is someone going to beat them up with a wet noodle? Call them names?  Shake a finger at them?
18482,"Communist funded mining pools, these pools have an unfair advantage."
18483,"At this rate, wouldn’t you think F2pool and miners will have limited Bitcoin to dump eventually?"
18484,Anyone can sell at any time. Stop throwing a fit bro.. Who cares what they do.
18485,Let me guess. You predicted this as well?
18486,"my charts are telling me from this time of posting up volume to 49395 then if we still have buying volume 50900 then possible resistance, if buying continues with this move top at 52825 before retracement. opinion only... babysitting trade"
18487,2:22 for Freudian Slip
18488,"OK, so if what you are saying is true.......how is this not a huge problem for Bitcoin going forward?  If it's that easy for miners to coordinate and royally tank the price, then investing in Bitcoin is a house of cards that could collapse at any moment.  We all understand that Bitcoin is volatile, but what you are describing sounds very serious and I'm not sure if there is a solution to that problem."
18489,this guy keeps validating the fact that bitcoin is not a decentralized as people think
18490,"you were the rise and the fall of my eth portfolio, down 1.5k rn. i would like to know why you just stop talking about eth. maybe you’re the one shorting the eth market so hard"

Im liquid large and will wait for drop.... thanks for confirming BCBacker and your analysis too!! good shit. do you believe true ALT parabolic season will begin if it hits 38k?? love your show"
18492,Ben are you losing weight?
18493,"Here’s a question!! If China is doing a lot of the mining why would anyone want btc, mining in my opinion in the end the rich get richer. As it gets harder to mine places like China and their cheap power government controlled everything can control the coin. Your better off in stake pools. Just thinking out loud right? So if I’m reading this right China has every btc holder by the balls? Anyone else think the same? So a government supported entity like China can use oh say the largest dam in the world’s hydroelectric power to mine btc .. just thinking out loud any thoughts?"
18494,Henry!!!!! Lol
18495,"seriously though, why is F2 pool dumping?  Is it detrimental or are they keeping us real?"
18496,"Harmony $ONE still doing well and at a great price, $ONE to the moon!"
18497,"So at this point in time, is it even worth investing in BTC and ETH if whales and miners won’t let it grow?"
18498,YouTubers and Twitter expert knows nothing
18499,AHAHAHAHAHA RIP LONG
18500,China = State Capitalism
18501,Just a friendly advice turn off all the nonsense YouTubers and Twitter only and only watch price action
18502,more dogs in your videos please
18503,"Stop dumping the market. YOU ARE AN INFLUENCER.  If your 500k followers dump 100k BTC into the market, what do you think happens?  You ARE the market, WE ARE.  What we decide, effects the market, or creates it with enough influence.  Think like a LEADER, a market maker, not a pawn."
18504,And yet you still ignore the Binance corruption.  You are supporting this by supporting Binance.
18505,"If I would say anything on the topic, I think Bitcoin will grow rapidly when Ethereum adds the major improvement to the system. I am not concerned about the decrease in Bitcoin value. I think you should mention how you can buy some cryptocurrencies on PayPal. This makes it easier for the average joe to get into cryptocurrencies. You can only buy and sell through PayPal; however, you gain something else in nature: potential fraud protection. PayPal controls the public and private keys, but I think this will protect ignorant crypto buyers from some scams. The 4 cryptos you can purchase on Paypal are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and LItecoin. Think of Paypal as a Crypto security box in a bank. PayPal simply holds onto it until you ready to sell. I think the fact you can buy Crypto through PayPal needs more attention."

18521,I sold some. I don’t have any other money to buy the dip. Hopefully this dump goes way further.
18522,"""let them off the hook"".  What hook? Why are you always talking like we control F2? It's obviously the opposite, they are controlling us.  So why the false narrative that they must obey us? It sucks, but if there is a solution it doesn't start with believing that we control them."
18523,This guy eats too much hotdogs and McDonald’s lol

18526,Thanks B
18527,"Dude, bad TA call.  There is nothing to say we dump further at all yet.   Currently we're just bouncing between Daily ema's.  That's it. Breaking 4hr support doesn't mean squat. We had a great bounce to over 50%.  Yes, the pullback today is a little extreme, but it's also at 1hr OS so we could easily get a  bounce here.  Have you already forgot the August 30% pump which retraced almost 100% before blasting off into this bull market?"

I am wondering why I did not hear all this about mining pools dumping, the CCP possibly having control, etc before now on all these crypto channels.  No better that the precious metals guys.  What BS.  You all sit in your echo chamber and stroke each others egos and lure new people in with your lies and misinformation.  Just as bad as the metals guys, and that is a very big insult.  Its going up any day now.  Yup Yup the dollar is going to 0, the banks will freeze up, bank bail in, mad max beyond thunderdome, you better save yourself by buying gold and silver.  Crypto guys, same BS accept add on ""bitcoin is going to 400K this year.  I bought gold and silver last year, when I told my friends they looked at me like I was from Mars.  Same with Bitcoin.  Well, looks like they were right on both accounts.  Ohhh and if the Chinese are in control of huge amounts of bitcoin, then yes, that means the CCP is in control of every last Satoshi.   And if this is true, then we are truly screwed.  The CCP will chew up Michael Sailor and spit him out so easy.  The CCP runs most of the planet right now, they will use bitcoin to destroy anyone, and you won't stop it.  Don't sell your bitcoin, it is going well boyond 6 digits.  It is a way to fight the system.  Hahahahahahaha  Xi Jinping laughs, hey we destroyed your economy with our virus, what should we do next......

18552,what does short the market mean?
18553,The CCP tells their miners who they are allowed to sell to I heard it from a Chinese miner with my own ears. If they tell them who to sell to they tell them how much to sell. If not the give it all away. So dump it for money so china can scoop it up for cheap or give it to china.

18754,"Thanks for the informative video. The breakout continues👍B!tcoin could be in the process of seeing a ""volatile reset."" By the start of this week’s trad!ng session, moving between dips and rises is a typical neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for lnvestors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that trad!ng B!tcoin is way more lucrative than just hodIng and waiting for the price of B!tcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from trad!ng till I came across Prof Ryan program jackson for lnvestors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng B!tcoin works, to help them stack up more B!tcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 25 ₿ TC from 3.6 ₿TC with Prof Ryan help.

18773,"HERE IS A REAL EXPLANATION OF Bitcoin. It is just another version of a Stock. It goes up and down based on trades and can make or loose you money. They will tell you that it is to protect you incase a governments economy collapses. Stocks do the exact same thing already. You can buy stock with Dollars and sell it in Euros... Bitcoins price is also based on money backed by the government. If the world economy collapses so would bitcoin and the value of stocks. The reason it's price keeps going up is because people keep buying more. Once people get a little profit or they realize it's just another Stock they sell it off. When they do it causes the price to fall, just like a stock. The companies you have to use to buy and sell the coins give your transaction history to your local government, so it can't be used to hide earnings or shelter funds you already have. Originally it was popular among drug dealers and black market criminals, now that it is popular governments worldwide have forced the companies trading it to give the records to them. Using black market companies who don't turn over the info is a crime and you can be fined or arrested for tax evasion or sheltering assets if involved in a court case over another issue. Plain and simple it's just a Stock at this point and you can't legally hide the fact that your buying and selling it. So only criminals have a real use for it when it comes to hiding funds. You're much better off buying traditional stocks because eventually it will crash dramatically. It's just another bubble..."

Since then, however, the altc0in’s recovery has been incredible, with the crypto recently climbing to a 3-year high. Alas, the aforementioned bullish momentum was stopped in its tracks recently by B'T'C’s fall. In fact, on the back of Bitc0in falling, X'R'P corrected by 44% in a matter of days. However, recovery was back on track, with the alt up by over 36% in 48 hours. Owing to the fact that the said bullish pr!ce action is very recent, the same wasn’t projected very strongly by the crypt0’s indicators. According to a recent analysis, the alt may retest the high of $1.96 yet again if it is able to consolidate around the $1.40-mark before undergoing another strong rally. X'R'P has managed to carve a position above $1.18 and breach past 0.5 Fibonacci line at $1.246. A minor re-test of $1.416 was also completed and it was consolidating under the $1.40 mark.

Let's say I your coin being hack, your being still, can they trace who the hack is  really holding that coin. No right unless that hacker use that coin. But what if he doesn't use it just like to ruins the coin.then your hard earn coin is gone forever."
18800,"Gates' opinion is in direct opposition with his path to wealth. He claims that software with unlimited use cases, has no value. He also doesn't seem to understand that blockchain is an infinite ledger, an record of all transactions and wallet balances. So, in conclusion, his ONLY issue is the decentralization. Which aligns with all of his decisions, that all focus on centralized control. He clearly is fearful of any threat to central powers. Good video, thanks for making me think"

I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the amount of banks, institutions, and companies who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars with the intent to hold long term: how can we refuse that this may be the ""super cycle"" everyone is talking about? The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen.

18820,I think everyone needs to stop brining in Tesla's investment. They are doing it for their own discrete reasons. They sold around 20-30% of it already in 1 quarter. What would you say now? The last investors will cry but then one who loses should not point the blame the government for not banning crypto and not taking care of them. Greed killed them. As simple as that.

18912,"There is something big going on right now.  These elites are playing us and using our media to do it.  I became concerned awhile back and started studying Marxism.  Their using these tactics.  Then I heard about the great reset.  At first thinking it was some conspiracy theory I didn’t look into it.  But then I heard someone openly talking about it and I bought Klaus Schwab book “the Great Reset”.  These guys they thing own us.  He literally taking about what society to build.  He sounds like an evil scientist. 
They says we all will not own anything by 2030. D we all be happy about it.  Our freedoms are slipping away and we have to wake up to this foul and corrupt America haters.   They want to take our opportunities and freedom.  Everyone is trying to come here for a reason.  But we have to listen to these people through their colleges indoctrinate youth to be radical.  We see it. BLM. ANTIFA. That’s democrats the support it, bail them out. And it’s funded by Soros.  Obama was a student of Sal Alinsky or a subscriber to might be better way to say it.   But he may have already been radical.  But Obama said “change”.  That’s what Linen and a Stalin ran on. He said “in five days we are going start fundamentally changing America”.  You all seen how they acted when trump was in office through wild fits, ripping up speeches like children. Looking over at the group.  Pelosi is such a joke.  Look at Maxine waters.  Wow what a serious blunder how she made it to office.   They all have million dollars homes way away from the districts they claim to represent.  No no no.  These people clearly represent themselves and those who control them.   Their not changing anything.  People are waking.   They want chaos.  That why these bitcoins and crypto and whatever we might not even have computers messing with these communists.   
I’m more worried about the Bible and the word of God.  An amazing revelation.  Proven over and over."
18913,Bill gates... Pure evil. He hates BTC because he is a globalist. He hates freedom
18914,Bitcoin is ruining the planet. Their system is using as much energy as Denmark
18915,"I do believe that digital money will become a big hit 5 years to 10 years from now.
Many people find it easy to pay/buy using online and rather than lining up wasting your time and energy looking for products you wish to buy. or lining in a queue just to withdraw money from the banks. For example, I would rather order online my passport at and paid it online delivery rather than taking the absence of my work or not attending my committed schedules. 

With this Digital money like crypto, we can easily pay for our ordered products can be very useful to pay online transactions.  What if the store will come in your door? ""Lets called it Vehicle store"" all you have to do is swipe in your card /ATM to pay and voila the parcel you ordered is delivered.

And there is greater security just like withdrawing money at ATM but this time we are paying directly ATM cards swipe in the vehicle stores.

In my own opinion the Rise of cryptocurrency today will change the next generations.
Next-generation will no longer have to use calculators, count manually paper money because technology is there any app wallet is there for them to just to click pay, click buy maybe a robotic car will just drop by in your doors and drop off your products in your doors."

18953,"Even though all central banks in the world print their country's digital currency, it does not affect bitcoin and friends to become weak or even extinct, it will only legitimize the cryptocurrency that is more accurately called bitcoin and its friends. the existence of bitcoin and cs has never replaced the one  the name is a global major currency which says it can seem like an inconsequential analysis. Now gold and cryptocurrency holders have been worried on the part of gold holders, yes we understand that lately many infestors have started to switch not to crypto, it doesn't mean they don't like gold but only use it.  just a good opportunity and that opportunity will be more memorable if my global idol figures like warrenbuffet and billgates take part I'm sure it will be more impressive and there is a certain satisfaction in investing, to be honest and forgive me this skeptic has written a lot of expert comments and has  criticized the policies of the US finance ministers and gubers  Nur European banks are very naive in assessing bitcoin and his friends, maybe because America and the European continent hold the most gold deposits globally ... ???  with the existence of cryptocurrency, market participants will automatically be amazed by the presence of cryptocurrency. global gold equity decreases and the impact of the price is stagnating or even decreasing, that's a bad thing for gold holders, the value of their portfolio slows down. Infesting in cryptocurrency has its own physical satisfaction, yes maybe there is a fundamental reason, yes?  can build what mood maybe because bit coin is the coin of the champions ...?  that's just my version of understanding .... and in my version there is a reason too yes bitcoin biting coins, not everyone biting coins is only done by champions which means bitcoin is the coin of business champions, champions in this case are idol figures and those who  I am proud of the above, the true champions of the universe."

According to bitcoin Halving cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in the bull run, so if the PI indidcator (and BTC) might repeat a similar bull run to 2013. these indicators are experimental and therefore there is no certainty.

People who invested in Bitcoins at the beginning or even in 2013 or 2015, when Bitcoin was crashing, have now become millionaires. I have been more skillful than lucky.

19070,"4:40, Bill Gates is clearly lying and does own some bitcoin.  Any poker player knows he is lying with 99.99% certainty by that reaction.  I think he was being weak and giving in to peer pressure with Buffet and crew so negative and in the room.  FWIW, Buffet has walked back his statements and is slowly moving towards “The biggest mistake of my life was getting bitcoin wrong”."
19071,"It is evident that they are hiding behind these statements. Bitcoin has value, it is a way to escape from governments. However, is this a good thing? The truth is that they understand it's not so that's why they give a negative opinion."

19075,"nice analysis mate! if only we had more people paying attention to the crypto market, the bullish movement on the crypto market these past weeks has been beneficial to both the holders and traders alike, but more for the traders. This i can say for fact because i personally as a signal user, i was able to trade and make profit running over 89k USD, although i had guidance from Jason Brown, we all can agree it has been a good run for crypto assets. Being a signal user for a while, i can firmly say trading with Jason signals is the real deal, i have made a lot using his signals in my trades. strictly for crypto Jason can be reached on  telegram (JasonBrown1) WhatsApp +447537126930"

19087,"I always get confused when they say things like bitcoin is going to make banking for all Africans possible..  are we talking BSV?  because BTC costs 30 dollars per transaction and can only handle 6 transactions per second.  I know BSV can handle 50k transactions per second on chain and it costs .0002 cents per transaction and dropping but I don't think that's what these people are talking about.

BTC is low tech low efficiency crypto, I really wonder when smart people start calling a spade a spade and throttled tech throttled tech."
19088,in a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrency.
19089,Bill Gates still hates bitcoin.  How somethings never change.
19090,The people who use counterfeit fiat currency to artifice a business advantage for themselves of course don't want the general public in control of their own money..
19091,He doesn't know what he is talking about. There is a lot of work getting Bitcoin. And it is not easy to mine.
19092,"things bill gates grubby hands couldn't corner and got catastrophicly wrong.  Linux, Tesla, opensource, and electric trucks.  guy is a monopoly man NOT a genius of geniuses.  he has his hand in the digital dallar and doesn't want competition"

19097,I don't care! Crypto is live crypto is future😀😀😀
19098,"Negative Me: Lmao Bill Gates has a horrible poker face. ""I sold my birthday gift.""-my ass. He definitely has Bitcoin and he's had it since it's inception. He's not stupid, he just doesn't want to give his honest stance because he knows how big of a deal it is and how dangerous an unregulated currency gaining popularity among the proletariat will be... Just like Tesla! He doesn't want affordable innovation given to the middle class.
Positive Me: He's being honest And he's worried about people funding Bitcoin instead of the actual economy with dollars leading to government regulation of crypto. This leads to the BTC bubble popping & Americans who had invested more than they should've losing their money. I mean... Tesla's stock is totally overpriced... even Elon agrees with that. Maybe he's right about crypto as well? 
Actually I just think Bill doesn't want to look like a nublet in front of his wise investor friends so he just sides with them."
19099,Stocks are good but I swapped and interested in Forex and Bitcoin trading l've been making good profit

19106,"Bill Gates is one of the wisest men on earth, possibly surpassing his mentors Charlie and Warren."
19107,This title is very misleading. Gates never once predicts a panic of 2021. He said he would short it 4 years ago and since has remained neutral.
19108,"Bitcoin dropped to $61,000 giving new investor time to set up another investment plan.....some people will still missthis golden opportunity due to ignorance"
19109,"Of course one can short Bitcoin, it has a futures market. Bitcoin crashed in 2017 when the futures market opened proving the point."
19110,"No offense, but I don't think you really understand finance and investing properly. Short selling is not that difficult and there are not 1000 different perspectives why it is a bubble deflator."
19111,Bill doesnt know about market manipulation and tether power!!!))) I think if 20 % of crypto holders wanna cash out there woudnt be enough cash! I real action is ahead of us in crypto!
19112,He probably says that while buying himself
19113,"It's strange how people talk about all the profits,

19116,"Terrible advice from Buffet, Munger, and Gates. Time proved them wrong!"
19117,There is an easy way to short Bitcoin.  It's called a cryptocurrency exchange and you are able to short crypto in the same manner stocks can be shorted on a stock exchange.
19118,"From a technical point of view, the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls, as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time. the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens, it might assist the market in reaching higher highs.

19121,"Bitcoin is not an asset or investment. It is in its current state 100% speculation. Look at this: more and more people step in it and don't care about the risk: in the Netherlands market research showed in early 2021 5 % of the population has bitcoin, and another 15 % plans to bet on it in 2021...and don't care about the risk. Ergo: casino! and as the maker of this video says clearly....fast rise and even faster downslide. Can be finished in months!"

19127,"The crypto mark:et is currently experiencing a bull run and a lot of newbies see this as a chance to get in on the action,
I think I'll let others hold the bag. This happens anytime something moons. I've seen with Bitcoin in 2018, in the silver mar:ket, the oil mar:ket, housing and even about individual stocks. When something moons like this, sorry you are too late. My advise if you are planning to go in the Crypto Mar:ket is you should trade with a wise approach rather than buying Crypto, holdin it to make gain and then get disappointed by an imminent crash in a few weeks. Over the past year I have been able to make 13+BTC following the instructions and s!gnals from Allen Kovac, He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradN Bitcoin works, to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto mar:ket and also stack up more Crypt0.

But as Internet access is so big in south east asian countries now specially in India  Bill gates see profit , other hand he impossing and playing same game now to shift his business to south east asian countries .

19129,"I feel the other side of this is that bitcoin has brought new people up and it threatens the old wealth of many. I could be absolutely wrong. Or they could be trying to scare people away from it. If we dont operate on the system they can manipulate they lose power.

Also keep in mind Microsoft would like to roll out their own cryptocurrency."

19131,"Those words are not financial advice but political propaganda.

If you didn't notice already...
We are systematically pressured from all sides.

Stock market will crash obviously since it's way overpriced compared to what it produced the years before. It's just inflated and at some point the money will be taken out of there and put elsewhere, so it collapses.

At the same time the biggest chunk of money in history was printed. Which short-term pushed the house prices to all time highs since 2008 already and now further beyond.
As soon as the FED increases interest rates, this market will crash as well as the gold price at the same time.
And then all middle class people who lost their loan-contracts and inevitably now have more cash piles and no property, then the inflation comes and takes the cash away.

So ALL your possible option where middle class people could invest are systemically wiped out.

The ONLY ""black market"" that can not be controlled entirely (control being the goal here), is crypto.

That's what you can see in china!
China doesn't like or even forbids the crypto market but it's still the biggest crypto market in the world.

So basically they try to make you people scared of the only threat to their plans.

If you don't believe me, learn about how inflations and Megainflations started. Learn about their plans in Davos 21. Learn about the powerful people's agenda 2030.

If you didnt hear of the ""great reset"" while all the news were focused on a big ship stuck in a canal in asia then at least invest 30minutes in your future by googling this.

Peace"
19132,"5:20 not sure why he says ""you are not producing anything""... To produce a bitcoin (mining), you need to spend energy which costs money. But then if you say, you are only coming up with ""information"" through mining, then everypiece of software is equally ""information"". The point would be that if someone finds that information useful (be it a software code or bitcoin), then it is worth something (has value). Bitcoin finds usefulness in exchange of value. So... Yea, you ""are"" producing something."

This is called the Cantillion effect. Digital assets not control by them and with no  ability to inflate is a threat to them. They are parasites. Time they worked for a living.

19253,"Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when i encountered Blain Reinkensmeyer services., although i have been into numerous services but Blain Reinkensmeyer stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Blain it was more easier to understand, Here are his details on Tel- gram  ( @Blaintrade ) for his assistance on strictly crypto related concern.."

..and learn Gematria"
19298,Gates is a 🐀 just like zuckerberg
19299,"Governments do terrorism, money laundering and fiat money scams. Then they blame the same thing on anyone who tries to create a system which takes away their criminal activity and tries to make the system legit, trust worthy, honest and the best system to serve the human race. Then you have some cock sucker that tries to create a video such as this one to try and smear the good effort of the people who are trying engage in this BITCOIN REVOLUTION."
19300,He doesn't like it because people are becoming rich from it much more easier then getting into stocks and shares.
19301,lol at all these losers in the comments section thinking they know better than the guy who invented the PC
19302,All three are just keeping hush on the standard XRP. They all own tons of that.
19303,"This Demon Gill Bates doesn’t want us to own anything, he admits in a Ted talk openly he thinks the world needs genocide and vaccines is his choice of weapon"
19304,Sounds to me like he's been pretty consistent throughout. Bitcoin no. Crypto and block chain yes. With his African connection probably ADA or XRP.
19305,I thought Bill himself was speaking at the start of the video lol good job man
19306,bill gates = Satoshi
19307,"3:18. I wonder what part of bitcoin's ""technology"" Bill is talking about.  All of bitcoin's ""technology"" is aimed at making it so you can't control it, which is what he doesn't like.  If you want to control it, you don't need bitcoin's technology.  In fact, you could make it far more efficient without it. It's like he doesn't know anything at all."
19308,I think it's important to remember that this is the same guy who didn't think the Internet was going to take off.
19309,"Just the same way I saw testimony of how Austin helped a man make -$50,000 weekly Profit I tried now am also sharing my testimony with over,$10,000 from the company  thanks for the good did he has done for me for this short period of time."
19310,All the money is going to XRP. Bill has invested on XRP. He said BTC NOT XRP
19311,"Lol ,,Satoshi Nakamoto knew very well what he was doing,Bitcoin doesn’t care who wants what or wants to control,bankers, big investors, politicians are afraid of their position,we want to be able to control it cryptocurrency,,,now not only great whales can invest, but also the average person,thanks to Bitcoin!! We do not ask for companies, entrepreneurs,bankar who only care about themselves,and we work for a minimum wage to produce foreign cars in western countries!!  All due respect to Bitcoin 💪🙏 From Slovákia"
19312,Bill gates is a tit
19313,"Great video,keep it up!💰🥕💰"
19314,"Bill Gates Makes As Much Sense As A Hippie That's Been Smoking Coyote For A Week, He's One Of The Richest People In The World!"
19315,"Gates LOVES Btc, he is a globalist and knows its future. This is the man who thinks we need to reduce the global population... This guy is accumulating he just DOES NOT WANT YOU TO OWN ANY."
19316,Afraid people are investing more ln this sh.t instead of MS? Just let people do what they wanna do. It’s their money. Tell this first to Michael Saylor’s face  🤪
19317,"This guy is too late to crypto and Bitcoin. Since everyone is HODLing BTC, he is trying to create fear in minds of people and snatch away from them. Don't listen to Rich people who missed to Crypto boat"
19318,click bait
19319,This man does even have a degree
19320,French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday announced that a 'limited lockdown' will be imposed across the nation to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19.Y’all should develop an online income means and focus more on bitcoin. I have been into bitcoin for a while now.
19321,"He predicted Covid, built Microsoft. We should listen to him. Don’t let your desire to get rich quick pollute your mind"
19322,Bill Gates: Enemy of the People.
19323,Bill Gates is just mad early investors will all end up richer than him without any effort
19324,I can't separate it from PayPal. Digital Currency.
19325,"He’s sort of like Henry Ford, who hated the fact that technology necessitated the demise of his beloved Model T. He’ll always be famous but technology can’t be stopped by denial"
19326,"This is guy who thought MS netBEUI would see off TCP/IP, and didn't see the Internet coming."
19327,He did short Tesla also back in the days so...
19328,safemoon
19329,"Zelf proclaimd philantropist 🙈
biggest criminal in human history.."
19330,He hate bitcoin for no Reason!
19331,That’s how you know you need to buy bitcoins because bills says don’t pay it
19332,"these old guys are so sad. ""I don't understand what it is and don't know what it is but i think is terrible people should stay away"". Also, if Buffet, Gates and so on are so sure about btc future dump, why aren't they shorting it? And don't tell me the crap ""uhh there aren't ways for big investors to short it"", jez they're big investors, if they want they can make institutions like Binance or others create instruments to short it."
19333,Bill Gates needs to shut up no one cares what he thinks. Warren Buffet is old and out of touch with reality.
19334,Bill Gates is a  POS. Do the opposite of what he says.
19335,Bill got burned by Elon Musk when he shorted Tesla
19336,"Short answer:  He’s a globalist and doesn’t want anything which represents liberty, autonomy, or anonymity."
19337,Well 640K is enough for anybody - Bill Gates 1981
19338,I I'm so overwhelmed that this paid me I never believed it not until my first withdrawal with AUSTIN.
19339,Bitcoin = Tulips??
19340,Blockchain pool ceo  is a criminal who seized all our accounts since July 2020 and all our money vanished in MARCH 2021 blockchain is a mafia system that ruins our accounts
19341,"I have been investing with mr Chris Russ, I came across some nice comments about him here on YouTube and I gave him a try and honestly I didn't regret the move"
19342,He doesn’t like it because it’s competition for him
19343,"Bill ""i stole all ideas from others to get rich"" Gates, you mean that slimy weasel??"
19344,I can easily see the cons within Bitcoin and have accepted the bearish possibilities although Bill Gates seems like a sore loser.
19345,"Yes friends , I got my withdrawals from probtcfarm.com i did not pay any fees when i withdraw. Thank you 🙏🏼🙏🏼"
19346,I would have loved to watch Bill Gates short Bitcoin
19347,go F o
19348,Lol 😂 Microsoft just started doing Bitcoin stuff this week.
19349,"Who cares what bill gates thinks? He is not a financial guru, he’s a computer programmer."
19350,It's pretty simple....he is not a fucking idiot....
19351,safemoon🔷❤
19352,"Bullshit u are just too late to start on bitcoin ? 
Or u are afraid of people go to crypto than stock !!!
Btc there is no one can control it for their self “
With big caps almost 14000 bilions dollar
Thats why its flutuaktif...!
In stock there is one who always comman the price up or down...! Thats a fucccking cheating people....!"
19353,"He's an idiot.  Put your money where your mouth is.
Just because he's Bill Gates, it doesn't mean he's GOD.
If he were to short Bitcoin when it was at $10K in 2018,
he would have gone bankrupt by now and sold MFST
to Michael Saylor and Elon Musk.
What an idiot."
19354,He shorted Tesla too. He's a dumb f-k.
19355,"He is actually telling you that the technology behind Bitcoin is great, but he does not like it for moral reasons i.e. money laundering and criminal transactions. The media has been pushing for 10 years the narrative that Bitcoin is a network for criminal organizations, despite not providing any hard data to support that claim. I think the more this narrative fade away more people will embrace the technology."
19356,Bil Gates is ignorant ass...e
19357,"Not content with controlling most of the personal computers on earth, Bill Gates is currently busy trying to 'vaccinate' the world population with an experimental pharmaceutical. He is also now the largest owner of farmland in the US. His next project is tampering with our food supply, no doubt? If you haven't heard of this already, it's probably because he's also one of the top four investors/influencers in the mainstream media. This guy is dangerous!"
19358,"He is one in a million, best among many, most trusted , I almost gave up on trading then I met  him through a friend,  Austin is  the most trusted trading expert who helped the life of my family and I ,"
19359,"People's opinion don't matter when facts speak for themselves: the dollar is being inflated at high speed withnout limits, and when the stimulus hits the banks and then these banks create 10x the stimulus volume due to fractional lending, 1 ($) = 0 (value) becomes an equation. Keeping banks operational cost much more in CO2 than all crypto combined."
19360,"Bill Gates makes me cry , I hope god exists"
19361,Gates is the typical authoritarian pro-regulation establishment Democrat. He will never understand this. He's getting old and dethroned now.
19362,"Nice video, but it wasn’t clear where you said it can’t be shorted yet some exchanges do allow it but not for large firms 👀 that doesn’t sink in my brain at all 🤷🏻‍♂️"
19363,"The best decision I ever made in my life was investing in financial market. Trust me guys, it pays!😊"
19364,More like the Gates panik of 2020-2021...  Crypto is gonne be great for the people around the globe and can slove so many issues that he is afraid of it.
19365,Many benefit from the current centralized banking system and in a decentralized system they lose control.
19366,Let's not forget Gates also shorted Tesla
19367,"Just the same way I saw testimony of how Austin helped a man make -$50,000 weekly Profit I tried now am also sharing my testimony with over,$10,000 from the company  thanks for the good did he has done for me for this short period of time"
19368,He had absolutely no imagination and no class. He's a child at sea.
19369,No way man!! My 20 dollars of bitcoins will be worth billions and I’ll soon be able to take over the world!!! 😆😈😈😈 Then make everyone my slaves!! ☠️
19370,"If he does not own it why does he own Google patent WO2020060606 (the beast system) 
Sociopath"
19371,Okay there doctor strangevax
19372,Whoops a picture of the carona virus was a bit random on a Bitcoin talk
19373,"There is this bizarre semi-religious belied that an expert in X is automatically an expert in Y. This is simply false, and this video amply demonstrates this. Bill, just stay with your Windows and leave Bitcoin expert opinions to Bitcoin experts. Deal?"
19374,what backs bitcoin? USD?
19375,"Gates is involved with cryptocurrency Mojaloop, of course he's going to put down the competition."
19376,"He is one in a million, best among many, most trusted , I almost gave up on trading then I met  him through a friend,  Austin is  the most trusted trading expert who helped the life of my family and I ,"
19377,If it did crash I’d buy as much as I could get.
19378,ROFLMAO Bitcoin is extremely easy to short. Just saying. Do it then Bill we will all gladly liquidate everything you put in.
19379,Governments will simply continue to demand taxes in fiat the run to fiat during  tax fillings will crash bitcoin constantly
19380,hater
19381,They know loads of people will be getting rich
19382,i hate him
19383,"He probably put a few billions in it himself. When they rich see a system that bring up poorer people towards their level, its human condition to feel a little resentment. I will counter balance his opinion against that of Elon Musk and Michael Saylor since they are billions too."
19384,"at 4:05 the hacker is watching a youtubevide and ""hacking"" lmao, made my day bois"
19385,Gates an corporate socialist aka orwellian.
19386,"Bill gates also shorted Tesla, where did that got him? he couldn’t live with his failures and it got him back here"
19387,COINS WITH GOLD NAME (YFII GOLD) WILL BE THE NEXT TREND
19388,rise
19389,the best part; bitcoin can go up and down! great ! cause dollar will only go down
19390,AMC short squeeze jump on the rocket guys 🚀🚀🚀
19391,Bill is slime
19392,Man I don't like Gates
19393,"He is Deep State, all Deep State banksters hate decentralized money, and hate freedom for the masses.  He is also big on injecting poisionous toxins into the people, in order to keep populations low.  I'm for, anything this psychopath is against."
19394,"Do your research, you can short thru the futures market."
19395,"have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience, I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people, One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticising bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset, there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook, line and sinker and of course, those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing.  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) . Persistence and commitment and love for success is what you need in the crypto space and we all can.             cryptoforex60@gmail. Com"
19396,remember this guy sold btc so low
19397,bill gates is like those 1% who laughed at the internet.
19398,Don't believe any thing this guy says...
19399,He is jealous people stopped buying stocks
19400,"Those big fishes dont want the small to make any profit...and they´re right. For the this people insanely rich , BTC is like rat poison, Cause people will put their money somewhere else a non on they pockets. I´m pretty sure that is a bubble, and will explode some day, and wouldn´t go up forever. But also I´m pretty sure that you only can lose the 100% of your investment, but you could earn a lot more than that with BTC and other crypto."
19401,"When Charlie Munger talks, he sounds very ignorant. as if he’s trying to convince people that he’s still a good investor despite his net worth not keeping up with the growth of the snp500 lol. Bill Gates on the other hand sounds like he has a natural opinion. He talks like a genius would. I don’t care about Bitcoin. I’m not a Bitcoin bear or bull. Just making an observation here."
19402,"Bill: publishes fairytale of BTC crash
Everybody with more than 3 brain cells: order more"
19403,Crypto is the future but btc wont be part of it. Once there is a full transition over to the new monetary system. Btc will be useless. Xrp has a huge future in finance.
19404,"There is a difference between I would short and I am short for x billion dollars. Don’t listen to words, look at what people are doing"
19405,Hahahahaha pathetic clowns jealous they didnt get in early so now they try to destroy it. Evil ass bitsj gates
19406,Bill Gates is against Bitcoin just to appease his friend Warren Buffet. Before Warren came out against it Bill was all for Bitcoin.
19407,"I'm simple man, I see this guy I press dislike."
19408,THE RICH STAY RICH BY SPENDING LIKE THE POOR AND INVESTING WITHOUT STOPPING THEN THE POOR STAY POOR BY SPENDING LIKE THE RICH YET NOT INVESTING LIKE THE RICH...
19409,"My comments on Gates get censored. Nothing more to say ... We all know who this guy is and what his ""clique"" wants ..."
19410,"Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Peter Schiff, Charlie, they all missed the boat and they all look stupid for smart men"
19411,It’s rat poison because they are the rats!
19412,He's just rich. He's not right about every possible thing in life. Get over worshipping rich people.
19413,"He’s just jealous! His time has passed, the world of technology keeps evolving and he should be proud and happy he contributed to it."
19414,"""I do not own bitcoin, im not shortin bitcoin so i can take neutral view.""
How the hell that can be neutral view?"
19415,"This control freak should not be given any air time, he doesn't like crypto because he cannot control it."
19416,The mining gives it value
19417,"I think trust has been broken for many and never to return to Gates, Dorsey, Zuckerberg.  Why would anyone trust these guys when they have advocated this wicked new narrative for our country.  They are finished.  Cryptocurrency is already causing MAJOR disruptions to the financial industries and its impossible stop it.  BLOCK CHAINS will change crypto to create utility/use more easily for the common man/woman.  Legislation/regulation has already started because its not going anywhere.  Gates is 1000% wrong and people would be foolish to take his advice and not buy some crypto asap."
19418,Let me tell u what will happen. Elon Musk will rule the world if not this one Mars and these guy's will die cause they are allready fossils and not so much to live. But bitcoin and cryptocurrency will be the future. Just let's live with the ppl like Elon Musk and Michal Strategy and we will be fine
19419,"There have been rumors in the past that Bill Gates is purchasing Bitcoin. Which is why his project Microsoft 6-0 6-0 6-0 is so important. He will literally mine the human body through the usage of vaccines which contain the nanobyte technology needed. The cryptocurrency system along with the vaccine will replace every form of money. This will be the fulfillment of Revelation chapter 13, the mark of the beast, the name of the beast and the number of his name! The vaccine contains an mRNA of an animal, which is the mark...  Microsoft's international patent number  ends in ...""6-0-6-0-6-0..."" which is the number of the Beast, and the dye used to indicate whether a person has been vaccinated is called lucifer rays! Which is the name of the beast. The only thing missing is the image of the beast which is the zombie-fied look those who take the vaccine because their bodies will no longer produce proteins. They shall seek for death and death shall flee from them. So why did FEMA as well as the CDC speak about a zombie apocalypse. This will be there psuedo resurrection of the dead. Bill Gates certainly reminds me of Harry Potter for some reason."
19420,asking old bags about the future is worthless
19421,He’s just keeping the price low to buy.
19422,do exactly the opposite of what Bill Gates says is a good way to live life
19423,"I think Bitcoin has a usable technological process, but it's one that can be replicated by competitors.  The problem I see with it is that it has no intrinsic value and is structured an awful lot like a pyramid and/or Ponzi scheme, and it's those elements that seem to account primarily for its price appreciation."
19424,He maybe fool or he just keep us as fools.
19425,why he is betting on a total collapse.. because he fucking sold almost allot of his stock couple days ago. I think something big is coming up. The reason why i think he is against crypto is because he DOESNT HAVE CONTROL over bitcoin like he wants to have control over the fucking world
19426,on alts PIVX is exploding.  Proof of stake is the next big thing in demand
19427,"Newsflash:  Bill Gates doesn't know everything, even if he believes he does."
19428,He also said dont buy farmland and now he is the largest land owner in the USA
19429,Gates feeling the peer pressure from his mates Warren and Charlie.
19430,Hypocrites
19431,"It's not true that you cannot short bitcoin, you sure do, even in an institution scale, by shorting stocks that track bitcoin. If Gates wanted to short it he could do it. But he knows he would have to be available to loose lots of money on the upside."
19432,"This is the guy who once dismissed the internet and then quickly realized his mistake and tried to use OS dominance to make up for it.

Also though he left by that time, Microsoft kind of dropped the ball with mobile. The current state of Microsoft with smartphones is reflective of his legacy. He no longer leads the company, but his mindset lives on.

What a buffoon. A rich one but still a buffoon nonetheless."
19433,the gates of hell
19434,Moral of the story:  ♣ Buy Bitcoin ♣ Never short Bitcoin ♣  You can make better decisions than the rich ♣ BITCOIN TO THE MOON
19435,People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
19436,It’s funny that the media and everyone will follow someone who owns no bitcoin And has been wrong about it for 10 years as a bitcoin professional
19437,Mrs Sydney is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy
19438,"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull with little sign of stoppn. I know people hate saying ""this time is different"" but the amount of banks, institutions, and companies who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollas with the intent to hold long term: how can we refute that this may be the ""super cycle"" everyone is talking about?

19439,WARREN BUFFET DOESNT PRODUCE ANYTHING
19440,"Cryptocurrency is the future, I'm not afraid of that.  What I'm afraid of is that a calm rational video that shows Bill is pro Crypto and realistic, has comments like these."
19441,The only rat poison is the dollar
19442,"Gates : Bitcoin will crash..

*Bitcoin crashed*

Gates : *buys all of Bitcoin*"
19443,Gates hates BTC because he can’t control it. He wants a centralized digital currency and nothing else. BTC is the future
19444,Bitcoin literally worthless cause all people do is flip it for more money.  Finding the greater fool
19445,He just want keep the control like all other. Im gonna buy bitcoin no stop. Better this then let my fiat dying in my bank anyway
19446,All of his assets are priced in fiat currency that’s why he is bearish. He fears change.
19447,"He hasn't looked far enough into blockchain technology to understand what it is capable of. Its not only going to be safer than visa and mastercard, but it will be faster and more transparent. Look at companies like Elrond EGLD that are literally creating a new financial economy.. its incredible. BG is just old AF"
19448,Watching this video after investing 200 dollars ...
19449,Have you ever heard bill says Bitcoin is only for rich people.
19450,Why would the US gov and the full fledge of it's military allow a decentralized currency to thrive in the future?
19451,"Bitcoin can be shorted simply at institutional levels using CME futures.  They are settled in cash rather than BTC but they do regularly influence the BTC market.  Clickbait was a bit misleading.  Bill Gates is not predicting a panic in 2021.  Also, in the interview with Buffet and Munger perhaps he had the desire to not be the odd one out.  Berkshire Hathaway stock does not have dividends.  Such stocks are priced via the greater fools theory.  BTC is not unusual in that.  Less illegal activity occurs with BTC than fiat by a large margin.  Full disclosure: I own BTC, I do not own many non-crypto stocks at the moment - just a Farmland REIT."
19452,talk is cheap
19453,"BG is a liar if he says he doesn't own BTC. He once said someone gave him BTC - what he really meant was, that he asked someone to buy it for him, and then they give it to him!!"
19454,"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office."
19455,Great video man. i'm working on a Bitcoin video myself at the moment. I hope you dont mind if I use one or two of these interviews!
19456,"Great Video, Thank you!
Could you possibly share your thoughts on Walmart vs Costco - who might be the better value company long term?  There's a lot of traction with value investing right now, i'm sure many will find value in this topic - similarly to your BRK.B play a while back. Thank you!"
19457,I hope he shorts it and it goes straight up to a million and liquidated everything he owns
19458,"Anyone ever understod economics, regulations and purpose of money will agree with Bill Gates, it is fine though. At the moment it is just a money laundring tool and if it EVER becomes close to cash/payment  equivalent, thins thing just HAS TO BE regulated just like every other transaction. I am not sure what is hard to understand here, it seems that the people think that those regulations are just the way they are controlled :) Funny storry, anyways, we leave in an age of extreme greed where companies like Tesla has 10x price that can be justified so this is not something anyone predict in a short term. In long term, I have no idea how can someone justify the price of this."
19459,"Crypto taking off so rapidly in such a short time given the market uncertainty has me conflicted. It could develop into a fantastic asset if this continues, but as soon as the media jumped on it and started promoting investing, that set off sirens in my head. May be tempted to get into it when it does inevitably have a serious, serious crash."
19460,"I see too many pressures for it to go up.  Those big institutional investors are poised for huge earnings growth and increases in free cash flows such as Square and Tesla.  Tesla is estimated to double its net income in 2021.  I imagine their 1B position could at least double.  Moreover, Africa is a rapidly growing economy. Finally, the financial services sector surrounding crypto is seeing massive influx of users.  Robinhood has more users than any, and they plan to expand the crypto offerings and have a crypto wallet associated with all accounts this year! So we have both retail and institutional investments surely to rise in 2021."
19461,Hes got 100 billion last thing he needs is another $.  Cant let the masses get a couple of million can we?
19462,"Yeah of course bill gates wants a digital form of currency, help out his central bank buddies use less printers to create cash out of thin air and track where all our money is going. The value of something is based on the populace, not one person. Privacy becomes a bigger and bigger concern every year as companies gather more and more data (like bill gates founded Microsoft), the way to go is privacy but that means bill gates losses money. 

He is against bitcoin because he becomes a poor man, not because he actually cares about people or any other reason he gives out."
19463,Isn't this the same guy who said the internet was a novelty?
19464,"BTC is the future of crypt0 and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 6.7BTC in just two weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by Rodwick. his methods are top notch and profitable. give it a try guys. Rodwick has a telegram channel @Rodwickgeorge where his provides daily signals for all members."
19465,Are live aaja
19466,"Hi. Bro Thanks for all the updates and help. Much appreciated by heart.  Actually I have one thing to say, whenever you give any signal on telegram, please make sure to double check it, in the terms of spelling. Sometimes its quite frustrating to not understand the actual meaning of your phrase. It seems like that the auto suggestion is on in your phone. Plz make sure to proof read ur sentences rather than hitting send in hurry. Again thanks much. More power to you :)"
19467,Bhai unlike the previous dumps on open markets this time they sold via over the counter(otc) so their will be no impact on price on regular exchanges

19497,"Filec0in chart was noting that the long-standing support has now turned into strong resistance. The pr!ce, after collapsing yesterday, was recovering above the $150 support. However, $161 had been established as firm support before the fall. Although FIL was on the path of recovery, it has not managed to breach resistance. Bollinger bands were indicating that the volatility in the m@rket has reduced. The market has remained quite volatile since the fall. The s!gnal line was trying to make a move which could indicate that the price trend was increasingly trending lower. Meanwhile, momentum was returning to the FIL market. Tradlng crypt0 @sset for an amateur like me was very difficult until i meet the genius expert bryant miller who has make it possible for me to make constant gain from tradlng crypt0currency, his s!gnal are second to none, his strateg!es has been helping newbies like me and other !nvestors to increase their pr0fit.

19510,"Thank you for your time and insight!  👍💕💕👍....Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Matthew Mark's services, although I have been into numerous services but Matt stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Matt it was more easier to understand, Here are his details on TeIeqram group ( @MattMarkTribes ) for his assistance on strictly crypto related concern."

19528,"From the look of things and according to experts in the crypto space. This period the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals, this i have been doing with Mr James Carlson daily signals which has been so accurate and well profitable, Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 6.8btc with my initial 1.2btc which you would agree is a very good profits. I see no reason to panic when you can build your portfolio with James daily signals and guides, James can be reached on Whatspp: +447476717980  and Telgram @ JamesC51 for inquiries into profitable trading systems."

19739,"I was banned from a new coins channel and I have a feeling it was because I asked about a pump and dump. I see a lot of similar purchases and sells. I just wanted to know why there are so many of the same buys and sells. It seems like it is being propped up by either the devs or maybe whales?. There is supposed to be a tax on the sells @15%. Someone was saying the fee is currently turned off not sure how they know that maybe they sold something and noticed. I'm very new to this but was watching on poocoin and there are just tons of similar numbers. 666's 333's and 1000's down to the cent exactly. Very strange.

I think what they also might be doing is they have applied to coingecko and cmc so maybe they are trying to keep the numbers looking good to get listed because today it tanked big time."
19740,what if you buy the dip and sell at the rebound??
19741,"Spot on, I lost about $500 over 3 pump and dumps, and never made one penny.....when they call the signal its already up 100-500% then you buy and trying to sell is impossible as the price is dropping too fast....worth learning, and I am glad I never when in with more than $150 at a time."

- Speedy.

   - Can create buy and sell orders within a second of entering the coin pair.

 - Stop loss feature.

   - Means you can set a stop loss sell order to ensure you won't lose too much in case coin never reaches your profit goal.

 - Average price checker.

   - Bot checks last 24 hours average price of coin and creates a buy order at a maximum pre-defined value. This means you won't be buying coins at huge markups from people pre-pumping.

 - Simple to use.

   - Easy to setup with a customizable config file.
and many more...


AND IT COSTS NOT 300$ or more.

However, as the market crumbled yesterday, the value of UNI and other alts like Filec0in and VeChain were also drastically impacted. Uni;swap chart reflected the rise in pr!ce observed earlier in April. The pr!ce was already on a downtrend before volatility hit and dragged it lower. The pr!ce was currently close to the $31.54 support as it traded at $31.75. The convergence of Bollinger Bands indicated that volatility has escaped UNI m@rket; the s!gnal line crossing indicated a bearish market. However, relative strength index noted that the digital asset was near the equilibrium zone and it could suggest a further consolidation of the asset. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant gains from tradlng till I came across an expert bryant miller, whose tr@de sig!nals has been helping both newbies and !nvestors to increase their portf0lio. I have been a very happy person because I have been able to build my crypt0 asset in the space of a year since I started using his tr@de s!gnals and strateg!es.Obviously, he's the best and his free-tr@de courses which can be found on the internet is a handy tool for serious minded tr@ders, you should check him out if you want to be profitable in your crypt0 !nvestment.

19748,"By far my favorite channel on YouTube! From a personal view point I feel crypto got to be best thing that has happened to the financial market for awhile now, it continues to open room for bulk gains whether in holding or most importantly trading. Following the papers closely would reveal the amazing amount of institutes that have embraced the use of the crypto assets to optimal results, that’s why I would continue to say btc is only just in the early stage of a bigger surge. Considering the bulk returns one can get trading I’d readily pick it over mere holding. While it might be a bit late buying an asset while holding, it's never to late to buy in while trading crypto, am not really an expert trader, although I’ve been doing copy trading with signals provide by experts in trading.

If 90+ % of these groups are run by greedy, unscrupulous owners, it could be very easy, and profitable, to create completely honest and fair groups and never screw your members over, building and keeping a good reputation.

Owners buy coins before they announce it. Then there's the pump, where people buy regular sell orders from the order book. When the price reaches the owner's sell orders then they sell. A lot of people get stuck with the coins because not all of them sell at a loss. At this point the price is still higher than what it was before. Then arbitrageurs buy the coins from other exchanges and sell them on the exchange where the p&d happened. The price resettles to the original price."
