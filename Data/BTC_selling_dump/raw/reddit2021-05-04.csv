For the record, I will gladly pay my taxes to support the infrastructure plan, health insurance for all, homeless/mental health funding, as well as education and student loan forgiveness. I want us to have an excellent economy with a good social safety net and hope they spend less money on corporate tax breaks.

66,2021-04-18 23:29:46,"Bitcoin is heavily manipulated. To prove my point I'll share a few things I've uncovered. From January to now every time it hits a peak (which is usually a 10k gain) within 10 days it drops back down (usually between 20-10%) then around that 10day mark it starts to climb back up. And within 20 days time you'll see it hits a new peak and then starts the downturn again. Look at at the dates Jan 9th to Jan 26th. Feb 28th to Mar 13th. Mar 25th to April 15th. Look at every pean and then every drop. You'll see its like clock work. 20days grown 10days drop. That is clearly programs set to do this. 

Maybe I'm paranoid but either way I don't trust it. 

Personally I was so hype about crypto two years ago. Then when I saw banks and HF stepping in I was like there goes the free market. I'll still add some to my portfolio but not falling for the hype. 

I like AMC so much more. Even w/o a squeeze I'll be doubling my investment. But I know with 100% conviction that the squeeze is eminent. I'm 10k shares in.

194,2021-04-11 18:13:26,"Set a target for this bull market and then dollar cost average out of it on the way up so that when the bear market comes you can dollar cost average back in and get 2 or 3 ETH 👍🏻

Eg:

Some people are estimating a 5-10k target for ETH during this current bull run (which could last from now until anywhere between end of May to December)

You have 1 ETH.

So let’s say you do your research and you think that 7.5K is a good target…

Your sell targets could be something like:

+20% -> sell 10% ($240)
+30% -> sell 10% ($260)
+40% -> sell 10% ($280)
+50% -> sell 20% ($600)
+100% -> sell 30% ($1200)
+300% -> sell everything ($3750)

At the end of this you would have $6330

When the market crashes and ETH comes back down, you can either do the same thing on the way down in reverse, or wait until it get’s to a stable baseline and re-invest.

In the previous bull runs, BTC never went below the local top preceding the bull run… Many people think that means if BTC reaches more than 100k this bull run, BTC will never go below 40k again.

If ETH followed that (it didn’t last time and fell to $80) that would mean it could fall all the way back down to $400.

If you are patient, that would mean you are in a position to pick up 15 ETH this time next year. A great position to be in come NEXT bull run when the price will undoubtedly go even higher… (who knows, if gas fees come down to cents and the network can support more people, we could be talking about a 20k or 30k ETH as soon as 2024)

1. Deposit crypto
2. Take out loan with ridiculously low interest and fees using crypto as collateral
3. Take a moment to laugh at traditional finance companies that want to charge you 29.99% APR because your credit score is sub-700
4. After loan payoff, if the value of the collateralized crypto has risen higher than you paid back plus interest, you might consider that you actually profited from taking out a loan :)

These people believe in ETH (and crypto) long term and are fine with the crazy bear market that may come. This is the low effort way to own ETH. You can just go about your life, check back in a few years, and be happy about your gains.

Then the other type of owner is the ""swing trader"". They try to sell their crypto at the top of the bull market and try to scoop it up at the bottom.

This will be hugs hopefully making it not so expensive to use. And have you seen the growth of eth in the last few..the last year....judge by that increase. And you can. Also stake your ethereum and make nice rewards and it also adds stability to the network.

389,2021-04-12 09:27:26,"I'll give you a list of possibilties, not in order:

1. Open a BlockFi account and move it over there for 5.5 APY interest.  (of course this does put it at risk so is not as safe as a cold wallet)
2. Buy a ledger or trezor, move it over there for hodling
3. You can probably still stake it on something like rocket pool so you get a little income from participating in a validator.  It might be fun just to participate

When to sell?  Depends on your needs.  Of course this is not investment advice and I really am an idiot and know nothing, but if the bull run ends sometime dec-feb you could cash your ETH and then wait for ETH to drop in price during the bear market and rebuy.  If I had any ETH I'd just hodl it for 10 years and hope it moons.  If you need the money you could always sell it.  Mentally perhaps think of it as a savings account, where leaving it in ETH would lessen your temptation to buy something unnecessary like a lambo or nice watch.  
I think finding some way to get passive income from your ETH is a worthy goal (like participating in a validator).  It's important to note that getting any passive income from your ETH is likely to put your ETH at risk to at least a small amount, so you would have to be ok with losing it if the worst happened.",lightley,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mop5lb/finally_hit_1_eth_today_what_should_i_do_next/,"Finally hit 1 ETH today, what should I do next?"

624,2021-04-01 15:44:26,"So last night, crypto expert, Teeka Tiwari, gave his ""trillion dollar coin prediction"".  It was Ethereum, but he also stated that there are 5-6 altcoins that also will rise with Ethereum.  Filecoin may be one of those coins.

If that's the case, and FIL is one of those coins, then take heed of ""catalyst 1159"".  1159 is a number in the Ethereum code that means it will reduce quantity of available coins soon (May).  Before that happens, a bull run should start on ETH, (or continue like FIL), but the real explosion won't happen until May, when the line in the code takes effect.  By the end of 2021, he predicts massive gains.

BTW I'd list the other coins, but the guy wanted $2500 to join his newsletter to get the full list of his predictions.  Also, in the past, he predicted BTC, and also 5 other coins alongside it.  A couple of those coins grew at a faster rate than BTC.  If this is the case here, and FIL is one of them, I'm not selling until at least after May, most likely until the end of the year.",MrMichael31,https://www.reddit.com/r/filecoin/comments/mhope1/200_surpassed/,$200 Surpassed 📈🚀

812,2021-03-17 07:16:58,"Will the Corporate Bond Bubble Burst at 2 pm Tomorrow? 
 
This is the question I can’t stop asking myself.  
 
By implementing some alphabet soup of acronyms tomorrow, I think the probability is actually pretty high.
 
Here is my call:
 
The Fed is going to extend the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Rule to banks, which is due to expire on March 31st.  
 
This will unleash another source of demand for treasuries to try to cap treasury yields from rising.  
 
Remember that banks bought 17% of treasury issuance last year.  
 
Banks have lots of cash on their balance sheets and utilizing that as a source of demand for treasuries may counterbalance the lack of foreign buyers.
 
Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea posits that if the Fed doesn’t implement the SLR extension, another $700 billion of treasuries will need to be sold by those banks.
 
That’s not likely to happen, unless Jay is feeling frisky and wants free markets again.

If we get this type of MMT/YCC, the US dollar would likely fall while oil would spike higher as the money printer goes “Brrrr.”
 
The investment-grade corporate bond bubble may burst as inflation goes into overdrive. 
 
This would single handedly make the 60:40 portfolio obsolete, and bitcoin would consequently moon again.  
 
Be long volatility!

Right now, is the worst price we have reached is \~53k, and to drop BTC to another 9.x% to $49k you will need ... tadam ... $174M. This is about double of the amount you have required yesterday.

In the same time you need only \~$160M to buy out BTC to the price equal to $68k and increase its price on more then 26%.

So you need 1.08x less money to increase price to \~2.8 times.

&#x200B;

I'd say, there are one of these things are going on:

1. The FUD didn't reached its peak (might be but it's not critical and does not matter anymore, - the train has left)
2. Go bulls. That is the dip, and whoever can invest now will profit significantly in less then a week.

Some notes (obvious ones, CO is on stage):

1. Crypto prices are volatile, you must know it and you need to have titanium balls to bear with it. \[Oh ... fcking bears here ... unintentionally\]
2. If you sell your assets at a lower price than you have bought it, - it is not an investment, it is a loss. Never sell bellow the price you've bot your assets. Just bear with lesser price for a while (might take two or more years though). Beware that the BTC and some other real cryptos are the limited resource, and deficency in its availability and difficulty of mining/purchase will increase the prices inevitably.
3. Governments of different countries, will screw you as much as they can to squeeze one more cent out of you. Governments will make anything to keep the monopoly on money which is the leverage of foolling and manipulating you. Alwasy be ready for a bad news and have an exit strategy (the sell off might be a most wrong idea here). Some good exit strategies: Change the country of residence, to one that already embrace crypto currencies or have explicit rules for thier turnover (google for the list). Lobby with your own polititians on crypto currencies rules in your country.  Lobby with your  fellow citizens on crypto currencies rules for the prosperity of you your children and your fellow citizens.",pazak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m61lxu/daily_discussion_march_16_2021/,"Daily Discussion, March 16, 2021"

You do make a lot of interesting point though I think a lot of your thought process revolves around Bitcoin. 

To me, a somewhat of an atheist, this is like saying though you have your other paths you must still believe and trust in god or something.

I like everything you have to say about tracking crypto/gains/losses and paying attention to taxes. This is very important information. health savings accounts and retirement plans are also sick ways to avoid taxes, and heal/support yourself lol

I don’t think spending 3-4 hours a day reading about crypto is sound advices. Maybe at the early stages if you don’t understand fundamentals or terminology but this is bonkers.

I think being active in subreddits of your coins.x participating somewhat in daily discussions, asking questions about things you don’t understand, and doin your own research are all great over looking tips. 

If you love a coin and believe in its future and utility, why not dedicate some income. If you think it’s truly undervalued and it’s price will go up why not put it aside as an investment. 

If everyone who is new in crypto is in it to make money, why are we here in the first place? 

New technology’s and real world use cases are evolving everyday. I think NFTs are a great example of this as you’ve said. 

I like a lot of the apps and services you’ve mentioned. Although if people don’t know something like that, I think maybe some lingo and vocabulary may be challenging although I dont know, like most things I’m 80% sure, give or take. 

Overall this is amazing and I think you for this post.

assuming that BTC (and some ETH) is the main holding, what % is located to the other 8-9 coins?
for example is having 1000 ADA really worth it? or 500 coins/tokens on the EFT flavour of the month?

i do own ADA (not that exact amount, was just picking a number) but obviously you won't retire on 1000 ADA unless you really want to hold it long long term

1062,2021-04-11 14:10:04,"What a really long winded explanation of how to complicate cryptocurrency trading, spread your money as far and wide as possible, create an absolute tax nightmare and click your way to bankruptcy.

Most people here are trading in the 1000-5000 range, if that. All this advice is *possibly* only slightly helpful if trading is your job and your pushing towards 10k, researching 2-3 hours A DAY!? bore off, I'm working 10 hours a day, who the fuck has time for that.

I've been investing in crypto since only February 12th, gained 20% so far, compared to any other investment on this earth, that's unbeatable. Yeah bore me with the bull market talk, 20% is still 20%, I've seen plenty of posts about people losing in recent months, and the only way they do this is by overcomplicating things, and buying shit coins.

For what it's worth, and that's probably very little, but here is my advice, what I've learned, and my journey. 
Joined coinbase > did coinbase earn (£30) > traded earned coins for BTC > traded that £30 between different coins, exchanges and wallets until I lost almost all of it, mostly due to fees, this is called 'LEARNING' and is the best £30 I ever wasted, especially as it was free > bought BTC & ETH on coinbase > bought ADA & NANO on binance, xferred to exodus and staked the ADA > been adding to these 4 coins since, splitting it like 60/20/10/10 respectively ^ > profit.

I've set up stop limit orders to protect my initial investment plus 10%, if and when I reach 30% profit I will move that to 20%, and so on. I don't DCA, I just buy dips, invest how you like. The only mistake I feel I've really made, is actually not investing enough earlier, but if you're not comfortable, don't do it, that's how it goes wrong. But for those of you in a position where you're a bit afraid to invest larger amounts, whack it in and set up a stop limit order, this technically can't fail and all you'll lose is fee's.

The reddit crypto demographic really shines thru in these replies tho. Sheesh. OP isn't saying anything that needs to be trusted.  It's more like ohh right, that makes sense, keep records, learn taxes, be disciplined, fight FOMO, think in BTC not Fiat, stack sats, remember the cycles and don't be an idiot. 

This post is even TOO helpful. Now that I read it and corrected some of the messes I've made i wish OP would take it down so it doesn't help a million ppl I'm trading against lol.

If coinbase vc invests in a crypto project it has a higher probability for listing on coinbase. Look up the coinbase effect to see how that affects price.

1074,2021-04-11 09:43:56,"YES! Hammer home how important BTC is to evaluate the performance of your coin!People here often are oblivious to it and never check their alts against BTC.If they did they would see that even really succesful alts don't outperform BTC outside of a massive bull run and usually lose value against it long term.Yes even ETH.

>If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately. Why? Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you. You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.

This is also really important. I always delete my old coins and never look back. It's just insane to torment yourself with eventual ""losses"" or money you miss out on.

1088,2021-04-11 09:35:56,">, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm. Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested. Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold. Remember compound interest. There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.

I would like more information on this part. In the research I've done wrapped BTC or ETH has very low yields (1-2%) so I must be missing opportunities here. What are these opportunities for high returns that you speak of?

The price action is a distraction, its too difficult to track what the price action and meaningful signals are.  Just familiarize yourself with the halving cycles and wait for the date plan and exit your trade.  Its all about time.  Price can be full of false signals and manipulation but it’s impossible to manipulate time.  Time will take care of the price, the cycle is the only thing that matters.",khmerchinaman,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitecoinMarkets/comments/maeemi/daily_discussion_monday_march_22_2021/,"[Daily Discussion] - Monday March 22, 2021"

1592,2021-03-14 08:51:40,"While I like Litecoin, unfortunately all the accumulation from Grayscale isn't reflected in the price because it's not done on exchanges.

In 2017, when Bitcoin almost hit $20,000, Litecoin went to $360.

In 2021, when Bitcoin is now 3X at $60,000, Litecoin is under $225

As for MW, I think by now it's priced in because only the code is going to be submitted in a couple of days, if it's on schedule although the developer did say 11 days ago

""There’s still a ton of work left to do before the code review can be submitted, but I remain confident & committed to meeting the March 15th goal. ""

We're still going to be months away from having a community testnet launched.

Also the privacy aspect, although optional might risk exchange delisting, for example exchanges like Bitt-rex delisted z-cash as a privacy coin even if it was optional.

I wanted to hear from both hodlers and traders what their thoughts are on profit taking as I haven’t done this (probably due to greed/fomo).

1816,2021-03-14 19:58:23,"I am going to say it since no one else really is...  If this is to follow the 4 year trend, then we should expect to see a large decline in a few months.  The price will then go sideways for 2-3 months and then start to slowly rise and explode.  

My concerns with this theory.  There is more institutional money in this bull run.  This may cause a buffer for hard dips in the upcoming month, but could also limit are chances of going parabolic.

I feel like to really go parabolic like in 2017 there needs to be an opportunity for people to hop in, aka Large dip and then slow steady rise. This will make buyers feel comfortable that they are not buying at the top.  

I am not selling, even though I think a large dip is coming.  I am just not sure how it will play out this year with all of the institutions involved.  I think it could cause smaller dips and smaller highs, then what we saw from the FOMO in 2017.  

The good news is that it seems to still be following right a long with the 2017 playbook and maybe my questions will prove to be invalid.  Thanks for letting me get it out of my head with people that will not just stare at me like I am crazy.",njlimbacher23,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitecoinMarkets/comments/m4oea5/daily_discussion_sunday_march_14_2021/,"[Daily Discussion] - Sunday March 14, 2021"

"" *Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.*

*But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.*

*So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.*

*This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

1942,2021-04-19 00:12:00,"Nah, news is smoke and mirrors. You don't need news to drop.

Few facts:

Week and half ago there was inflows of 10k BTC to binance. This was never distributed/sold. Or at least wasn't sold fully. I suspect this was to prepare dump by selling some BTC to fund shorts without triggering bots with inflows of stables to cex. 

Mex whale posted buy wall at 54k in form of 4-5 X 5m walls and left it there untill fully filed. 51k which was tapped was only 50x liquidations levels. Most likely nobody was filled at this places. Nance is known for that. Stop will not trigger but bids won't get filled neither. Flash crash u might say. 

There was inflow/mint  of 96m busd to binance which most likely propped price to 63k or what ever ath was. 

There was 600m of stable coins inflows to another cex which also can be considered as the funds to prop the price to new ath. 

Now fun part:

There was open interest of 25b and only 10b was liquidated recently on derivatives side.

This means cex which ever started most likely Nance MM knew exactly liquidations levels and propped the price to build longs on retail side.

Then used 10k of BTC deposited early to open shorts and when time was right dump happened cascading stops of this degen apes. 

This was enough to bring price to 51k which conveniently closed of all gaps at CME , filled that whale on mex with 54k bids of 20m or more. 

Outflows of BTC confirm that fact.

But where is profit you ask???

10k of BTC on Nance was used partially to sell and fund shorts. This was easier way to cover all this. When enough shirts was filled bid walls was posted across different cex and when time was right dump started triggering stops. 

1. 10k BTC was sold for average price of xxx- profit most likely. 
2. Shorts - brought back massive gains in form of stables.
3. Stable walls got filled with triggered stops. Outflows showing just that. 
4. Profits from short (no.2 ) used to filled longs opposite directions. (This might be not happened yet, to much retail still in greed mode).
 

I think also Eth and other coins was bought or at least longs was opened. 


Everything can be checked. 
Blackout and stories of China mining is only to cover this great manipulation. 

Shortly after bank.of China is posting about crypto products as investment. How convenient. 

Nance most of this time when shit dumped and cascade stops was not responding to any bids. 
Please check Reddit and Twitter to confirm that. 

If you know how to play this game you will and should be rich.

If that was the case, then BSV is part of the plan and certainly was not accidentally farted into existence like OP seems to think.

One of the main contentions of this fork is how to scale:

2. Theoretical Optimization

BSV is spending real money to try to get to 128mb blocks. They aren't there yet but are collecting invaluable data about how the software works and MIGHT be able to patch it. They are actively sacrificing in an attempt to scale.

ABC, by contrast, decided that the software wasn't the issue but that the protocol needed to change with contentious evidence (see how BU heavily voted AGAINST CTOR).

I'd say that they are both trying to build with different tactics. If BSV can pull off 128mb blocks they will be justified.

- Neither party wants to be found to be trading back and forth. 
- SHF A naked short sells to SHF B, then SHF A transfers crypto to SHF B in lieu of cash, to sustain the next purchase.
- In this scenario we have two colluding to drive the price down but it looks like organic buying and selling as the parties appear to be entering exclusively long or short trades, and the flow of money is in a single direction.

2110,2021-03-15 02:55:36,"If you leave Nano after the events of the past week and stop engaging with the community. It’s cool, I get it. 

Goodbye, see ya, I understand your concerns.

but kindly fuck off. 

This is an experiment. All of crypto is an experiment. Good luck finding a project that is not fundamentally an experiment that isn’t flying by the seat of their pants. 

Here’s a secret, they’re all building a bike as they ride it. It’s all the Wild West. Even bitcoin. If you seek safety, go open a bank account at your local credit union.  

Nano is still in its infancy. Nano has always been a shared vision of what crypto is supposed to be. That vision is to make an efficient transactional currency that is outside of the influence of monetary policy. 
And to make that currency as accessible/ethical as possible so that it can get into the hands of the people in countries that actually need it, and make it in a way so they can actually use it.

This project is going head to head with the limits of what people think is possible, not only in the normal financial world but even in the world of crypto. We are kind of a group of crazy people off on their own path challenging everything, And because of that, we are going head to head with some very powerful people.

If you invest in Nano you better be ready to deal with moments like this, where we confront the system that we have created and the forces outside that seek to destroy us. This is merely a snapshot of what’s to come. 

Nano is not perfect, but it can be altered, improved, and tested and retested, by a community of developers who are united by the same vision I have described and a vision of what crypto is supposed to be and what crypto can accomplish.

That is the fundamental nature of Nano. We will always be in this everlasting struggle, this struggle does not stop at the next update/patch, but with each tweak, things will hopefully improve, but at the same time each challenge will likely push us to the limit, and we will constantly evolve.

Other crypto projects are not experiencing these growing pains, yes that’s true, but it’s also true that they have largely given up on solving the problems that nano seeks to solve, they have fees, they have systems that avoid our problems, not out of ingenuity or amazing foresight, but out of fear. Nano was built deliberately to confront these problems and to find the limit. 

Other projects have given up on the vision that Nano seeks to fulfill because they are afraid to confront these problems directly. 

So if you aren’t here for a long-term struggle, you don’t want to deal with these problems and you want to compromise with another project, go for it. 

But I think I speak for a lot of the community here when I say fuck off. The idea behind Nano cannot be stopped, we will experience squeaky wheels along the way and momentary struggles. But Nano is here is stay, and you *have* to be in it for the long haul to make this thing work.",HelloOfficer24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanotrade/comments/m4pca2/daily_general_discussion_march_14_2021/,"Daily General Discussion - March 14, 2021"

IMHO, with all the spam FUD I don't think the NANO/ETH chart looks all that bad. Yes there is some recent bleeding likely due to the FUD, but there were lower points since the spike in early Jan. Also just look at ETH/BTC alone.

2117,2021-03-15 08:34:47,"So we have basically hit first golden cross for bitcoin, in the 2017 and 2013 bull markets was a golden cross (or near golden cross), followed by a big run up. Then after the next cross the bull run was over.

I am still of the impression it will be the same as last time, we have 3-4ish months left in this bull market where BTC will run up to somewhere over $100k then the bubble will burst. I hope to see nano moon sometime in there to take profits but it will end up on whatever it gets.

My advice is to set realistic sell targets, at the very least take out your initial investment during the next big pump, to get as much profit as you can before we go into the next crypto winter. As long as this spam issue has decent solutions rolled out I will be picking up more Nano when its back at the floor with the profits from this run.

Block chain overall is a great technology innovation. Not just crypto currency but it has a lot of other use cases. 

Assuming the bull run will continue, you may prefer to take out your initial investment in phases such as taking out 10% when asset value increases to say 150% or when it grows to 300%, you may take out 100% of your original investment.

If it bear run, I think we need to have patience.

I mean,  the vast majority of people aren't thinking ""hey, I want to make 26.876% profit on this trade. Since we all look at these even intervals,  you would expect to see dips around every $100.

I'm getting runescape merchant clan vibes from this haha.

They used to pump the prices of some items and then the higher rank clan members would dump their stake before everyone else.

So what I used to do was get into the pump and then sell it for a small profit instead of a potentially big one.

2315,2021-04-17 18:52:53,"Thanks for the post. Some great insights!

I would reconsider this section though:

I like to think of the portfolio in terms of these segments:

Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

Privacy coins - Monero, Zcash, DASH..etc

Finance/Bank settlement coins - Ripple, Stellar...etc

Enterprise Blockchain solutions - Polkadot, Chainlink...etc

Promising/Innovative Tech coins - EOS, IOTA, Cardano...etc

Speculative/Moon shots - VERGE, YLD...etc

1. Your categories are wildly inaccurate based on blockchain ecosystem, and comparables

2. While its great to have some mental model for risk management and diversification, it means nothing. There are really no established markets outside of:

- Protocols
- DeFi/Exchange Tokens
- NFTs
- Utility Tokens
- Speculative Coins (90% of thibgs out there)

Diversifications is about exposing yourself to multiple MARKETS, to reduce risk in a certain one. There is no established market for privacy coins, and no discernible consistent utility, so all of these need to fall into the speculative category. There’s no model you can create to represent market dynamics.

Protocols are governed by tps, coins in circulation, with some supply dynamics.

DeFi is governed by TVL, exchange volume, and supply dynamics

NFTs by number of resales, comparable merch, and appreciation over time. Right now, you just want to accumulate some time based NFTs and hold em for 10 years if you are into this kind of thing. Im staying away. Might buy a cryptokitty or topshot for lulz. But NFTs are only valuable if you can generate resale.

Utility Tokens - similar to protocols, but also can be modelled by fees or fiat consumption, but TAM is restricted to the specific real world market comparable for that good/service

And then everything else. Buy it and hope it pumps during the bull run. 

Most everything moves together so tbh diversification is only useful in case of a rug or big fud/catalyst that you want to use to daytrade.

I don't see a 80% correction/crash in the next couple years. Crypto is starting to become mainstream in 2021. Things were different in 2017/2018. Now all the major players and governments are getting into crypto. 

Having said that most coins will fail. But Bitcoin and Ethereum are almost guaranteed to stay till the end of times. And then there are few other alt coins that have very useful real world applications.

I personally believe 2021 is the start of a golden age for crypto.

In 2018 I just bought with lump sums, and the coins would fall shortly after. It's easy to feel like a genius in a bull market and just throw all your cash in, but if you DCA you take all the emotion out of the game, and ride both the ups and downs. It will also keep you investing during a bear market, which can ensure great gains in the future :)",arealhorrorshow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msmszm/some_advice_straight_up_from_the_2018_bull_run/,Some advice straight up from the 2018 bull run

If you do well and take some gains to off-set costs and then crypto grows to a much larger part of your portfolio, and you still believe in crypto you shouldn’t be selling off just to keep crypto in the 5-10% range.

2351,2021-04-18 00:28:52,"I don't agree with most of this, I also went through 2017 and here is my take:

1- Each person is different and there is no general number you can throw randomly like this. For some 5%-10%, for others  it might be 30%. It all depends on your goals and risks tolerance. A money adviser would help you with this.

2- I agree

3- Holding gives better return only in a bull market, many made the mistakes of holding in 2018-19 bear market and lost 90% 

4- Long term investment in crypto is risky and looking back at 2017 fundamentals, nothing is valid to this day. New coins came along, new technology ... Yes researching might protect you from scams, but we are still far from mass adoption for Altcoins and thinking you found a solid project is naïve. 

5- FOMO happens when trading, not when Hodling and you said not to trade and 'hodl' was better, so which?

6- Everybody is a genius in a bull market and most people will lose in the following bear market.

7- I agree, you can't have all the projects that moon, yes you will miss on DOGE and others, but that is ok.

8- This goes with your 'research' at 4-

9- Diversification happens with uncorrelated assets, all of Crypto is correlated and it's delusional to think you build a diversified portfolio, it is not. Too many coins will dilute your potential gains.

10- like 8- this goes with your 'research' at 4-

11- I agree",GameofCHAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msmszm/some_advice_straight_up_from_the_2018_bull_run/,Some advice straight up from the 2018 bull run

2433,2021-05-01 21:27:59,"Yeah for sure! I went through this over the past few months. For example I heard about earning interest on Blockfi so I thought hey what the heck I'll put my bitcoin from Coinbase on there, might as well. Sent a small transaction to test, it worked, sent the rest before realizing the amount of fees I just paid would take several years to earn back in interest. Ooookay whoops, learning experience. Turns out it's better to sell and withdraw to the bank then rebuy on the other exchange than to try and send the crypto due to transfer fees. 
This is why I haven't put any money on metamask yet though I set it up. I'd need a big payout to make paying transfer fees to MM then gas to buy anything worth it. So I'd like to try the Polygon chain, but it looks like you have to pay the xfer fee and gas to bridge things to it, I don't see how you can buy directly on Polygon from the bank. Still so much learning to do!

2609,2021-03-08 15:29:12,You can't compare it to volkswagen because volkswagen was never 100 percent squeeze. Nothing has been 100 percent squeezed. They covered 30 percent. Then short laddered it down and people started selling thinking they missed the peak. Then they covered the other 70 percent when it dropped. Basically winning off this squeeze. We are here to kill the shorts. 100 percent squeeze = launching and not dropping back down. Remember big institutions still hold most of the stock too. So it will still end up somewhere high unless they started selling off.,Mangolorian420,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/,Exit Strategy DD: A comprehensive guide to maximizing your gains during the GME short squeeze.

2610,2021-03-08 14:55:32,"\*Alarm alarm\* Potential HF intern shill detected. Shill strategy of the weeekend/week: talk about super low exit strategies to convince people to sell early.

Some bits of interesting info (charts from previous squeezes), intermixed with hocus pocus bs (technical analysis) and the give-away: ""we'll probably have some 200 USD wedges and then a peak to at least 500 USD higher"".

Very subtle. Very bs. Why where price targets mentioned at all to make the point? Why such extremely low price targets? We're talking about a squeeze that will make the VW squeeze look like an ant. With $GME we're talking > 100% of the float shorted. Something that has most likely never happened before and will never happen again. Why mention 200 and 500?

I won't go looking for patterns, I've been trading long enough to know that all TA is absolute total utter speudo-scientific soothsayer horsesh\*t. What I'll do is: buy. hold. sell whenever I feel like I have enough tendies. And I do know that that is going to be a couple orders of magnitude higher than what was mentioned in this DD. It's either that or bag-holding. I truly don't care.

&#x200B;

This is about how my 20+ year trading insights have evolved:

Beginner trader: buy. hold.

Experienced trader: draw patterns, study charts, study news, create back tests, write quant algorithm trading bots. Fool yourself.

Expert trader: buy. hold.

Remember: the easiest person in the world to fool is yourself.

I personally have a target price and a plan to sell in increments on downward movement. Are you saying that if we “breakout” on the top side of the pendant there could “potentially” be another spike and that wasn’t actually the squeeze? I think that it’s important to really emphasize this because I can see a bunch of smooth brained apes who don’t have a clue drawing triangles all over their screen shots like your first picture thinking this is it🤦🏼‍♀️ I’m covering 10K then I’m in for whatever comes after that but I think there are some that may need a little help and encouragement along the way!

I have 2 questions. 

1. If any smooth uptick above $500 might be for Alpha, how can we differentiate the uptick for Alpha triangle if we expect $10K+ for the price? At $800 price +$2K smooth uptick might already feel large enough to fee like Alpha, without suspecting there might be another one for +$8K. Or even +$100K if it goes there. Is there any way to differentiate between those smooth very large upticks?
2. If we saw frequent halts for raising from $40 to $90 is that even possible to reach $10k, $50K, $100K or more? Would not it take forever to reach numbers this high?

2653,2021-03-08 15:15:59,"Thank you very much for this DD, I found it to be very helpful. What I think always needs to be stressed is the fact that every individual investor sits on an own utility function as has a very individual background when it comes to personal wealth. 

This is something that I have thinking about a lot when looking at all the VW-GME-comparisons. I think what it is important to think of is the, so to say, ""shareholder-structure"" and the wealth distribution of shareholders. What I mean by this is that it can be assumed that the shareholders in the VW squeeze will probably have been wealthier and thus more risk tolerant than shareholders in a potential GME squeeze. 

I assume that from reading in the subreddits here, a lot of low- to medium-income investors have invested in GME. In the end, I think what will also influence the hight of the squeeze is how soon the stock reaches ""life-changing-money"" for the majority of investors. This will probably be at a much earlier point relative to the VW squeeze. And I think that this is okay, because as you also put it, it will not be about ""us"" in the end, but how we individually maximize our profits. 

This does, however, not mean that the stock will not skyrocket, because of all the other parties involved. The sentiment of retail investors could thus not even matter in the end for ALPHA squeeze in the end.

2656,2021-03-08 17:55:05,"Excellent job! Thank you! However I have some concerns:

Why people is starting to talk about an exit strategy? GME is far from ATH. 

Why the post says there is nos “we” and then later on says “go with the crowd”. 

Finally, IMO all investment tactics and strategies are bases on fundamentals and/or a common behavior of stock market, but GME is not behaving as a common or normal stock.

2820,2021-03-09 03:06:00,"Excellent post, saved.

I read it all, I feel the need to add a note about triangles: volumes.

Volumes should start to decline from the moment triangle is forming, be very low close to the apex and then:

* increase sharply in case of a break-up
* increase in case of a breakdown, but this is not always necessary or true

Also, in case of a break-up, a second buying chance could be triggered when the price retraces back to the upper triangle line (now acting as a support) and bouncing back.

2847,2021-04-18 01:14:18,"Short answer: No

Long answer: probably not a good idea. I feel like after the hype of this current surge is over the value of Doge will fall to something much less than what it's at (although higher than it was). Bitcoin though, has a more stable value I think.   
All that is not to say that I haven't considered dumping my BTC and buying a bunch of Doge.

2848,2021-04-13 15:53:41,"""they've invested in BTC for the profit"" - most are BTC at treasury reserves. So, ""they've invested in USD for the profit"" would be analogous. Microstrategy intends to use some as currency (paying non employee board members with BTC).  Tesla intends to accept BTC for vehicles/services, without immediate exchange to fiat.

It will only make sense for institutions to sell this early if they need the capital.  It's a treasury asset for them. Held for reserves.  Selling, just because ""profit"" would lead to a significant tax burden.  I'm more worried about them selling for a deep loss for the tax-loss harvest. 

Companies like that don't burn their reserves unless they have a good reason.  They don't have to sell BTC for fiat to make profit.  They're large/powerful enough that if they want to transact in BTC for something, it'll happen.",brooksmus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mpz5v9/institutions_are_whales/,Institutions are whales

2851,2021-04-13 16:43:18,"I understand your point of view which makes sense. However, I start believing that the only catalysts for institutions to dump BTC is a return of confidence in USD and a return of “normal life” post pandemic. What made institutions adopt BTC this cycle around is not because they received a revelation out of nowhere and changed their mind.  
The stars perfectly aligned this cycle for the adoption of BTC: pandemic, money printing, loss of confidence in fiat, economy and regulators, distrust in the conventional system, realisation that things can change brutally and very fast, realisation that we must adapt to a new era, etc. Because of all of these catalysts, BTC is seen as a solution and it will remain a solution as long as the problems persist.

They x10 their btc, but because they have tons they need to pump the hell of the alts to then dump slowly for months, they now have maybe x2-x3 their btc but it's way enough because they have hundreds of millions. 

People need to realize alt coins are called shitcoin for a reason, they produce no value nor any utility, people are in euphoria right now because it's free money for everyone but wait until whales starts to dump their alts into btc, the only true crypto to hold in bearmarket is btc. 

I agree we might not see a -85% drop in btc because of institutional buying pressure, but your alts that nobody wants except dumb retails? Oh man, the next bearmarket will be a lesson to everyone because all I see now in /cc is that crypto is magic, crypto is gonna take me out of poverty, crypto is better than stocks, I'm never gonna sell crypto because it's the futures.

These are not stocks, and be on the steady ups and downs. It’s a volatile market, and takes sharp ups and downs. You WILL need to choose the right time to opt out, or in. It’s how it works.

But we mostly use it for scouting. Out of a batch of, say, 20 or 30 candidates, you could get a good one who's just undervalued and a bunch of others na masipag kahit di pa marunong. Okay lang yung latter dahil malaking bagay yung masipag: at least willing matuto. Saka we raise their rates naman, eventually. And siyempre laking tipid sa recruitment side.

Would just like to suggest that while you juggle all of your side gigs, leave yourself enough energy to focus on your studies.

You’re taking up eng’g in UPD right? With your grit, you’ll be able to land jobs that will get you much more than what you’re making now.

3228,2021-01-04 16:47:42,"Probably will be downvoted and called a bear but:

Is there anyone else that’s been around since pre 2018 who just can’t shake this sort of uneasy feeling?

I bought in mid 2017 and in late 2017 I remember all the same feelings most people are experiencing now. That excitement, that positivity (BTC to the moooon!) that feeling like it’s just going to keep going up and up (last chance to buy BTC this cheap!). 

But I just can’t shake the feeling that it’s going to crash again in the next few weeks. That’s when it happens, at peak positivity when you’re thinking this is almost too good to be true. 

Even if you zoom out on the 5 year chart and look at the 2017 bull run and compare it to this bull run, it almost looks exactly the same just on a smaller scale.

I’m still super long on Bitcoin in general and of course will be holding some long term but after this run back up to 35k, I may sell a bit of my stack.

Or I could just be wrong and it will hit $50,000 this year cause who fucking knows?

Not shilling just sharing because it’s cool. It’s not even a live or very actively developed project. I just really like their plans and ideas with this. 

I’ve been tinkering with solidity and learning how to build an ERC20 so I’ve been digging more into the random obscure projects out there. These guys are trying to implement MimbleWimble on Ethereum combined with zero knowledge optimistic roll ups and rather than merkle trees a merkle mountain range for data management off chain. 

Thankfully they wrote everything in Python, a language I sort of know. So I’m sensing a 2021 New Years resolution coming on. 

Ethereum 9 3/4. Named after platform 9 3/4 from Harry Potter. My guess is because Platfrom 9 3/4 is hidden from the public so nobody can see who is there or even that a train exists; a little nod to the fact that all transactions happen off chain with zero knowledge that any transactions happened because MimbleWimble doesn’t allow secrets to be spilled to the provers of the zk-proofs.

3624,2021-01-03 15:11:57,"The longer this pain continues, the higher we will rise. Honestly this feels so different than 2017, I was there early 2017 already. 2020 had to be the year of regulations but it has not happened. Everybody is off by 1 or even 2 years. Total market cap reaching 1 trillion, lawsuits left and right aiming for regulations, I mean guys, this is it. I know people don’t want to believe it but what will happen is that XRP will pump so hard soon. There’s always “insiders” who know what will happen. So there will be insiders who will buy the shit out of XRP even before it’s declared a non security or before some settlement is made or whatever will happen. That “small” pump will probably bring us to a dollar maybe higher... Just wait what will happen next, people will think that XRP just pumps because of the general market even it has the lawsuit going but in reality, well, someone will know something... 

Just don’t be fooled by BTC right now. There’s 600B+ in BTC, it’s not smart money to stay there, it’s smart money that is making money of the average stupid investor who still thinks that BTC has actual value. Don’t get me wrong, BTC is likely to stay but don’t be fooled that this is the nr. 1 currency out there for the next 10 years. It simply is not. 

XRP will rise hard, very hard. Flare will contribute to that massively. Imagine DeFi coming to the XRPL. It’s coming, we know it, and it’s going to be absolutely massive. 

I don’t like to make price predictions but I truly believe that 2021 will blow away some people in terms of XRP price. They will all be like “how can this be?”.

If you’ve held 2-3 years or longer, why would you sell right now? What fundamental has changed except for a stupid lawsuit? Do you think Brad and Ripple were having coffee the past 3 years with all regulators? It doesn’t make sense, it’s here to stay!

3635,2021-01-03 03:57:05,"Just thinking loud here... So you all think that it is OK for Ripple execs to dump XRP? I mean there is nothing wrong with them setting up bots to cover up their asses when they sold tokens? I get it, discussion about XRP itself can take a while, but Ripple’s execs making $ while they “believe” in XRP seems a bit unethical to me. I would be be totally fine if they sold XRP to fund Ripple’s operations, but that was not the case. Moreover, I am surprised that many XRP holders think that this behavior is ok. If you believe in XRP why would you dump it (let’s forget about price manipulation allegations)? Maybe XRP and Ripple is the next system that will replace swift and will become a standard, but Ripple’s execs dumping coins while everyone eats shit seems to me extremely unethical and shows imo that all execs cared about is to make $ despite all of their statements (actions speak louder). I am not saying I do not believe in XRP, but execs actions definitely make me think twice about what exactly Ripple as a company wants to accomplish.

3639,2021-01-03 01:47:49,"you attempt to rationalize SEC's actions but you do it from a standpoint of a demotic holder

its not about holders

SEC is not motivated by what concerns an average holder

they dont do it this way

and I dont think SEC was aiming to directly destroy XRP holders or their value

SEC simply saw massive bitcoin rally on the horizon, and they should of been dumb not to see it, right?, then immediately jerried that a huge rally is likely to bring XRP price to higher levels

now then, according to SEC, garlington and larsen are implicated in selling XRP as an unregistered security

now, why let these guys profit immensely off selling XRP amid inbound bitcoin surge?

so they launched their lawsuit to pre-empt garlington and larson from further selling their shares, knowing that a rally this huge could drag XRP along to an ATH thus maximizing their profits

again, why let garlington take advantage of this rally, while SEC insider could take out a short and then toss a lawsuit at garlington?

if bitcoin rallied in august they would of brought the litigation in august

they didint want to let Ripple Labs keep on with the selling, and seeing that they now have no chance but to take action within their regulatory framework, they went to nail G&L asses to the deck with thick large headed screws, and did it right away

its not about protection of shareholders, because SEC probably decided to not deem it their competence to weight in the current situation, and consequences and whatnot and how this might impinge on ripple holders' portfolios

they simply wanted to prevent the CEO and board from profiting further",MiscellaneousPlot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/kp0cqw/sec_deliberately_timed_this_lawsuit_to_reck_xrp/,SEC Deliberately Timed this Lawsuit to RECK XRP HODLERS Period

3642,2021-01-03 04:57:40,"Look at it from an objective point of view and see that the lawsuit didnt come overnight and could have been predicted.

**28 U.S.C. § 2462** states that “\[e\]xcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained **unless commenced within five years** from the date when the claim first accrued if, within the same period, the offender or the property is found within the United States in order that proper service may be made thereon.”

From the Complaint:
**67.** Starting in **at least 2015**, however, Ripple decided that it would seek to make XRP a “universal \[digital\] asset” for banks and other financial institutions to effect money transfers.

**68.** According to Ripple’s plans, to create acceptance for the universal digital asset, Ripple first had to create an active, liquid XRP secondary trading market. It therefore continued its efforts to develop a use for XRP while increasing sales of XRP into the market.

**74.** Garlinghouse joined Ripple as COO in **April 2015** and substantially assisted its ongoing unregistered Offering by, among other things, being responsible for its operations.

Larsen, Garlinghouse & Co. knew the Filing would come till EOY ( 5 year frame ) so they created a last liquidity scheme starting Juli2020.

 “Our bitcoin holdings are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents

MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin.

 
We also pursue a business strategy of acquiring bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin.  We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes.

We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, though we may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate Cash Assets for treasury management purposes.”

Big institions like banks, investment firms or even companies like Tesla are not in it because they believe in the tech. They believe in the money. We already saw Tesla taking some profits. A bank doesn't just buy 1 billion worth of bitcoin because they like the idea of decentralized money. They did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that buying now and selling later will make them a lot of money. They all already know when they will sell and how much. If those milestones are hit they will cash out a chunk which will dump the price. Let a couple of those dumps overlap and they might even panic because they are not used to this market. At that point they will get rid of their bags while they are still in the green, dumping the price even further. Because they own such huge amounts a couple of them selling might actually be able to crash the market. I think Tesla selling all cryptos they have + Elon Musk tweeting something like ""Bitcoin is dead"" might actually end this bull market.

If big institutions are buying Billions worth of crypto, at 50-60-70k, do you think they will allow it to drop back down to 5-10-15k? They have enough power to be able to manupulate the market. or at least keep it going sideways during the whole drop.

Unless there is a Massive Golbal Event, I don't see the cycle going worse than before, it will happen, but it will be tame and probably shorter.

It's a yoyo.  they sell at X then buy at 90% of X and then wait and do it again and again.  It's fraud.  The founders say it's someone else - but somehow their wallets sync up so there is a connection and F2 should be doing something to stop it if they cared.  But their founder is sketch.  Whatever - each investment has it's drawbacks - long run the more money comes in and the more risk they take dumping someone might sit and wait for a dump and buy right at that moment.  there are smarter people than F2 out there.

4133,2021-02-05 23:16:48,"Hey everyone,  I did some math. Let me set the stage first.

Chun Wang (CEO of F2Pool) tweeted that he sold off 10k bitcoin and that they (presumably) had a total of 1,000,000 BTC. So, if they had a maximum of 1m BTC (which I think is actually overestimated), then they have sold (or moved) 12.5% of their BTC in the last 20 days. Yes, that is 125k BTC.

They are selling at a nominal rate of more than 6k per day.

This gives them a \*maximum\* runway of 160 days from the day they started dumping or 140 days from today if they keep this pace.

   * It sounds like they are scared of a member default and want to be able to react QUICKLY... to maintain sufficient liquidity to complete end-of-day settlement.
   * The new rule changes basically means the dtcc can now calculate this 'fat loss fee' everyday and even during the day and force a payment. So pretty much the dtcc is covering their ass and are going to liquidate the member themselves when shit hits the fan.
   * In other words the dtcc will fucking crucify shitadel through a margin call the day this pops and force them to close their short position

$70b of short positions were placed due to insider news that GameStop was going bankrupt or something of the sort. 

WSB community led by DFV decided to raise the price to liquidate or essentially make the shorts be paid back at a higher price. This resulted in a massive short squeeze as the shorts expired; leading to hyper media coverage strengthing the run. 

This situation was unique. But for every sell order, there has to buy. People lost and will lose, just as people have won and will win. Difference with GME being, the institutions/hedge-funds lost big time as they were the ones buying the tops to repay their positions. 

What you’re implying is market manipulation that needs people to continue to buy the tops that will only lead to losses for a number of those people. You say everyone will double their money, but someone has to buy for “everyone” to sell? So many stories on this sub about people getting roped into exactly what you’re proclaiming and getting hit with significant losses.

4184,2021-04-05 06:18:24,Just so you know depending on where you live pump and dump schemes are illegal and it doesn't matter if for instance you are in the USA and investing in a pump and dump in a chineese company its still illegal for you cause you live in the USA. That being said if you are not the one heading up the pump and dump and if you weren't one of the top investors I don't think you'd get in trouble but I don't know for sure. That being said if you ARE heading up an initiative to pump and dump a coin or stock be careful it could land you in jail depending on your local laws.,Malaki202,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mk8k8p/will_a_gamestop_movement_like_work_with_crypto/,Will a gamestop movement like work with crypto ?

The volume typically spikes upwards toward 20-25mil, when other bars around are way less. This only occurs on Bitstamp. 

Looks like this latest volume spike run began back around Jan. 19th. Coinbase delisted around then. Maybe it's Jeb dumping. Maybe it's Bitstamp receiving liquidity. Maybe it's Madeline.

To give it a name so you can google it, it's called a ""barbell"" strategy.

What people used to do was a 60/40 split stocks/bonds

Not financial advice, but I personally would not think its insane or anything to be 95/5 stockindexfunds/bitcoin

The ""safe"" end is the stock index fund (nothing is safe in this world, know that)

But the ""risky"" end is the bitcoin end which is giving amazing returns relative to the risk I think you're actually taking, but JUST my opinion

I am not giving you financial advice okay

I personally think that if you/'re 80/20 stockindex and bitcoin, you will be totally fine, don't reindex during a bull run maybe?

DYOR (do your OWN research)

Etc!

Have you got all the basics of /r/personalfinance squared away?? Be sure you do, have an EMERGENCY FUND

Do not ever put money into bitcoin that you need for your life!

Good book on this (not about bitcoin) but about making money is ""The Psychology of Money"", find it at your favorite bookseller

Do whatever makes you sleep at night and not worry! Let your emotions guide this, imagine how sad you'd be if bitcoin crashed and you didn't diversify, and alternately how happy you'd be if you stayed in and bitcoin soared, but you did diversify. Find a happy medium so you stop worrying. That's your risk tolerance. DONT hang it all on a dream in case it doesn't come true. But DO give yourself a chance at something great.

Have an emergency fund, 3 months, 6 months. Cash is trash, but savings do still matter. They let you overcome unforeseen problems.

The question is what the bear market will look like and when exactly it’s coming. Will we see a parabolic leap to a 100-300k Bitcoin followed by a euphoric alt season where every stupid coin jumps 100x in value just because it’s crypto, followed by a rapid 90% drop in the market that ruins everybody? Or will the way up and the way down look unrecognizably different and everybody is going to miss it? And maybe these slow bleeding dips are actually what the crash looks like when there’s big money support levels.

Everyone wants to magically predict the crash so they can get out with profit before it happens, but nobody knows if this is the crash today and it’s just slower because of all that institutional money, or if we’re going to see a 100k Bitcoin next week and selling then is too early because you’d miss the 300k Bitcoin the week after, and the crash will be more gentle and settle around 50% while we all hodl in profit.",Tritador,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbaofc/there_will_be_a_next_bear_market/,There will be a next bear market.

these ""institutional investors"" aren't random individuals who can afford to be down 60% for 3 years in hopes that they make their money back. They have fixed costs and a fiduciary duty to shareholders.

My point is, sometimes it ISN'T worth to HODL. Sometimes you SHOULD just cut your losses, because sometimes that coin specifically doesn't recover, even if the market as a whole does. HODLing forever is not a solution unless you've diversified in coins that you truly believe will be adopted.

4339,2021-03-23 17:16:41,"This next bear market will be different I think, but all because of one key aspect.

The last bull run in 2017 if memory serves me lasted about 7-8 months. This is from when BTC started to rise, kept rising, then hit it's ATH.... 8 months.

So let's assume that this bull run is going to last a similar amount of time, that takes us to christmas and slightly beyond.

We'll see the same ""peeps buying xmas pressies with BTC"" from BTC maxis, but what we won't really hear is the fundamental utility adoption going on for other cryptos. Everyone will be shouting because ""omg, i'm rich"", and then we'll hit the bear market, again, for years.

However, when we recover, BTC won't have as big a share of the overall market of cryptos as it has in the past. At this point, I would've thought several cryptos will be used in live environments with actual utility, and those tokens will fly much much higher in the next bull run, and they'll also eat up Bitcoin's market share.",TimsKillerRabbit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbaofc/there_will_be_a_next_bear_market/,There will be a next bear market.

Yes, a bear market will happen and shaking out those weak hands is a good thing. We'll end up with more hodlers in the end making Bitcoin more valuable and more stable in the long run. You just don't want to be one of the people forced to sell at a loss because you invested emotionally. 

It's also very possible that we'll see a super cycle, meaning a short bear market of maybe a year before we see another large move to the upside. This is because the ratio between hodlers (institutions, long-term buyers, bitcoin-believers) and weak handed retail is leaning more and more to the hodler side causing less selling in a bear market and more buying as well.

4465,2020-12-13 00:47:15,"This week has been so bullish that I'm pretty excited for BTC's price action in the future. In the past week: 

\-Grayscale bought 14k BTC (900 btc produced daily/6.3k produced per week only) and 142k ETH. 

\-Microstrategy raised $650m in bonds to buy BTC. 

\-MassMutual invests $100m in BTC. 

[https://bitcointreasuries.org/](https://bitcointreasuries.org/) is also a really good source to see how much BTC institutions are holding atm, at it's currently over 4% of the supply. 

These are all catalysts for supply shock. The BTC supply is limited, and institutions are now starting to pick up on the value of BTC as the value of USD keeps going down.

4637,2021-05-01 23:27:29,"The way I see it there are really three main outcomes. For the purpose of this analysis I am going to assume the GPU market remains largely the same by the time POS rolls out. It seems unlikely it will get meaningfully worse, and we will just assume it doesn't get better.

First case: Ethereum miners pivot to a variety of alt-coins. This drives up the difficulty, making these coins less profitable, but still profitable. In this case there will likely be little to no dumping of GPUs onto the used market, but we can expect to see a decrease in the demand for new GPUs for mining as the profitability equation makes it very difficult to justify such a high capital expense for low profitability. This demand will almost certainly not drop to zero, but will still likely drop.

Second case: Same as before, Ethereum miners pivot to a variety of alt-coins, driving up the difficulty. This time the difficulty is driven to a point where it becomes unprofitable for a meaningful number of people. This can be because it literally costs more to run their rig than they earn, or the amount they earn could be less than expected depreciation due to wear on the cards and expected market stabilization. Either way, this would result in some number of miners offloading their cards on the used market until the difficulty stabilizes at a level where it is nominally profitable for miners. This would increase used supply, driving down that market, and demand for new cards would also drop significantly from miners.

Third case: Given the massive hashrate of the ETH network, it is possible that pushing all these miners to other coins could trigger a sharp rise in difficulty that leads to a GPU market collapse. Essentially, if the 2nd case occurs it could depress the used prices of cards, leading to a reevaluation of the expected depreciation of a miner's existing cards, leading to more miners selling, etc. This case seems relatively unlikely, as it would require a rapid sell off of cards to tank the market meaningfully.

As stated in the beginning, all of this assumes no change in the market from now till then, which is likely not a fair assumption. If the market improved this would likely only exacerbate the above effects, and possibly trigger them early (unlikely, but you never know). If the market gets worse everything above should still apply except 1) it probably won't matter that much cause the market still sucks and 2) the effects of perceived depreciation may be more muted as miners see the market continuing to trend upward, or at the very least still sitting above where they bought their hardware.",danfay222,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/n2att5/unpopular_opinion_dont_count_on_light_at_the_end/,"Unpopular opinion: Don't count on light at the end of the tunnel, it could just be more tunnel"

Meaning that even after the next halvening (last one was May 2020, so first half of 2024) BTC will *just* then catch up to Ethereum after it's issuance drop. BTC would drop to 164,250 a year (450 x 365). Adjust supply for 3 years out --- 18,665,000 + (328,500\*3) = 19,650,500 --- and we get to .83% issuance.

4662,2021-03-26 21:57:53,"ETH is already establishing itself as the money of the Internet. NFTs are tapping hard into the internet art, meme and gaming culture & they're priced in ETH; ETH is the best trustless collateral in DeFi with tens of billions of $ worth locked up.

Around 8% of the supply is locked in DeFi, and 3.1% of the supply locked in the beacon chain for staking (which will only become more as Coinbase and RocketPool are rolling out their staking solutions). I also expect the use of ETH in DeFi to grow substantially as the yield is simply too attractive and DeFi is still exploding in new usecases and projects.

And then you give institutional investors a choice: Do you invest in BTC, or do you invest in an asset that is a hedge against inflation (even more so after EIP-1559) *and* generates a yearly yield on top of it?

And while we're talking, big companies are onboarding to DeFi soon, lead by the baseline protocol https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/; they now also have a lot of choices in terms of which Layer 2 to pick from. If you don't believe me, here you go: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mb80at/daily_general_discussion_march_23_2021/gs6268t/ 

This is from Paul Brody, head of EY blockchain. They are revolutionizing ERP systems by breaking up all the siloed data in ERPs and enabling fortune 500 companies to trust each other by leveraging a credibly neutral middleware, and that's Ethereum.

And you're wondering if you should buy ETH? With rollups going live in a couple weeks/months, EIP-1559 in July that will make ETH deflationary, and a rapid move to Proof of Stake by the end of the year.

4709,2021-03-26 22:52:56,"Ethereum 2.0 cancelled their layer 1 sharding efforts (or delayed it far away in the future) and are going for layer 2 scaling now. This means smart contracts will not be able to be executed in their layer 1 and their layer 2 scaling approach sacrifices atomic composability.

Avalanche, Cardano, Fantom, Solana, Algorand and Ethereum 2.0 are not sharded in the first place and therefore will run into bottlenecks sooner or later.

There are a LOT of scam coins in crypto, some already shuttered after being found out it was a scam, some currently still operational (like Dent token) and some we aren't aware of yet.

Dent the company itself is doing a good job, they are doing what they wanted, Dent the token is being used by the Dent team as a personal piggie bank. They sell BILLIONS of tokens a week to Binance for BTC. Then when BTC will go up they'll profit BIG time.

Dent the token is definately a scam. The plan by the team for the token has always been to use the token as their way to make money on it by trying to convince people that the token will be of value in the long term while knowing as soon as the price goes up a bit the team would sell HARD. This has been the strategy of the Dent team.",CerberJM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lltew7/dent_the_token_behind_the_worlds_first_digital/,"DENT, the token behind the world's first digital & global operator, is highly undervalued."

4924,2021-04-14 00:39:12,"in since day 2 or so after i found it in this reddit topic. Sometimes i´ve a good nose for the real things.

Right now it´s only with a buy order, like if the price dips to a certain point you can set it to buy, i can´t wait till the option ´ sell order´ is working later. I tried it 1 week ago already and it worked. Just search for a good coin with lots of dips and ups, set the buy price at around that dip price and spare a lot of stress. I also tried the ´ Trade butler´ , a tradingbot like this but with the sell limit too and as software. But on Linux i could´nt configurate it good since it had problems with fluxating prices that were out of sync. The Bog tradebot is lots easier and it works.

Btw , it´s always a good idea for security reasons to make another wallet just for the tradingbot , like some BNB and the coin only . If something became hacked then they can only go in that second wallet.

Endorsing something that is well known to cause more people to lose than to gain, is simply in poor taste. Shitcoins ARE a gamble, and a terrible one at that. BSC IS the casino of crypto, arguably no better than a gas station game bar where people go to lose their paychecks after work.

These are a gamble and they are hugely risky, iv gotten bad coins and rugged but to be honest iv actually won on more coins than lost, maybe I just got lucky, but I'm only putting in small amounts and I'm only using money I made from my original 80 dollars, so it seems like a good move for the time being.

I've seen people say it's wrong this that and the other.  A market is a market and for it to work some people have to win and some have to lose.  If you are a newbie trying to buy 500 in safemoon cuz you saw it on tik tok and you just buy not knowing anything then oh well.  You should not being investing if you have no idea what the blockchain even is.

Anyway I am trying to develop a sort of plan or system to increase the chances of being a winner on the BSC casino.  I am fairly new to crypto but I have just been eat, sleep and breathing it the last 6 months.  I believe that by taking the time to dig through BSC and identify certain things you can start to develop a pattern.  

I might be a total moron and be totally wrong on this.. But I enjoy the hunt.  I am actually wanting to start a semi small group to help test out this theory i have.  So if any of you are crypto junkies like me and might be down to work together to map some shit out I think we might be able to give ourselves a ever so slight advantage at the BSC casino.  I need to just start a discord or telegram or something.. If you are interested i guess just send me a message and if I get a couple ill start a private group probably on telegram since i have that on both devices.. but I have to warn you now to get this data that can potentially help is really boring lol I mean I like it because I am a nerd ..

5046,2021-03-08 03:32:25,"**Selling for profit seems like a mistake when big corporations are accumulating.**

Either they know fiat is going to further spiral into the toilet AND//OR bitcoin is going to keep on gaining. The accumulators aren’t exactly daytrading or flipping for short term.

Compare endgame/doomsday scenarios:

- internet gets locked down making protocol illegal
- crypto holding gets locked down requiring registration
- trading / holding requires special licensing only available to high power entities

now think of the opposite side

- it gets adopted and used as-is as the new digital backbone for 2nd layer
- it becomes so scarce that it starts to align with valuation along the lines of “all the money in circulation”
- it becomes seamlessly integrated with digital payment, not “converted to fiat” meaning the interface is never able to change access to the funds

As Hal Finney said: the “gamble” on the bottom was miniscule in 2010 and while it’s a lot more now, it is still tiny compared to the potential yield (not even monetary yield, but privacy).

In the cases that bitcoin busts, I think we’d all have other problems to worry about and solve.

It’s as clear to me as this: saying “bitcoin fails because of the heat death of the sun” versus “bitcoin succeeds because people prefer to use it” is a no-brainer",eqleriq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lzm8e1/50k_on_a_sunday_hodl_your_satoshis/,+50K on a Sunday - HODL your Satoshis!

5264,2021-02-15 17:48:27,"Apart from potential conspiracy theories, real answer is combination of 2 things - arbitrage and automated trading (bots/algo trading, whatever you call it). 

Very few bots actually can do this and it requires being in the same building or even on the same server as the exchange server to be able to do it, but basically imagine that at time 2:45:59:200 (200 being milliseconds) a big sell order dumps BTC price from $1000 to $800 (using these for simplicity). 

_____

So, a bot is seeing that price of BTC is $800, while price for ETH is $100 and price for BTC in ETH is 10 ETH/BTC. The bot sells my ETH for USD and buys BTC with it (thus dropping the price for ETH and bringing up the price of BTC), then sells that BTC for ETH. Let's say I sold 10 ETH at $100/ETH (let's ignore liquidity at that moment for simplicity), got $1000, then bought 1.25 BTC with it ($1000/$800/BTC). Then, finally, I can sell that BTC to buy back ETH at 10 ETH/BTC, getting 2.5 ETH extra. Everytime I sold something, I brought down it's price, everytime I bought something I brought up its price. So, reviewing my steps, first I sold ETH for USD, thus dropping the price of ETH in USD, then I bought BTC with that USD, so I increased the price of BTC in USD, then I sold BTC for ETH, bringing down the price of BTV with respect to ETH. So as a result of me doing this arbitrage, I gained 2.5 ETH, while lowering the price of BTC in ETH and increasing the price of BTC in USD and increasing the price of BTC in ETH.

_____

After I did my trade, another bot sees that the ETH for BTC costs 9 ETH/BTC, but the price for ETH is $900 (since me selling ETH for USD just a millisecond ago brought the price down), and the price for BTC is $820 (notice how it increased just a bit from my previous trades, compared to my stronger effect on ETH/BTC and ETH/USD markets). This bot has BTC and wants to accumulate it. It sells 1 BTC for 9 ETH, then sells that ETH for $900, then buys 1.097 (almost 1.1) BTC with that. In the process it increased the price of BTC in USD (just like I did before), decreased the price of ETH in USD (just like I did before) and decreased the price of BTC in ETH (OPPOSITE of what I did before). 

So, this way, we both lowered price of ETH in USD, increased the price of BTC in USD and balanced each other's impact on price of BTC in ETH (or ETH in BTC).

_____

Lastly third bot who holds USD and wants to increase its amount simply buys BTC, sells that for ETH, then sells ETH for USD.

All 3 bots are getting gains while making the price of ETH in USD dump and price of BTC in USD go back up, until they find balance again. 


_____


That's what you see on the market - if someone dumps BTC, its price in relation to other coins also decreases, and the price of other coins with respect to USD also decreases. This going back and forth until there is mo more gain in arbitrage, so all the prices are lower with relation to USD. The last thing to understand this process is that I said ""price of BTC with respect to other coins decreases"". However, this effect is rather small because BTC's volume is so big, it takes ALL other coins on arb like this, so the decrease of price of BTC with respect to an X coin is miniscule. 

If we take into account the difference in liquidity, and adjust the ratios of price changes there, then you'll see how it all comes together.

_____

Lastly, someone who wants to cash out from multiple coins into fiat would try to dump them all at the same time, so instead of giving all this sweet arb grease to the arb/algo traders, he sells his alts at the original high prices, before the bots correct those.",kid_ghibli,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk6sap/multiple_coins_hit_a_big_dip_all_at_841_pm_pst_why/,"Multiple coins hit a big dip, all at 8:41 pm (PST).

Let’s be honest, a good majority of the altcoins will not make you a bunch of money. As many of you who has been in this space for a while may agree, there’s often more hype than tech in this space. Many of the altcoins will die out or not achieve what’s promised/expected in the next few years.

5332,2021-04-10 12:08:16,"Personal story. 

A long time like 3-4 years ago which is a long time ago in Crypto years. 

I mainly bought bitcoin, litecoin, and Ethr cause they were the only ones available on coinbase. 

I always wanted to buy Dogecoins since I first heard of them. So I created an account on kraken and bought Dogecoins and then I proceeded to buy some other altcoins that may actually have value. Well I bought these coins at the height of Crypto Hysteria in Jan and Feb 2018. 

I have a shit to of alt coins. Also have a couple of bitcoins.i then pretty much emptied everything sometime around 2017 or 2018 first during the 19k btc peak then in late 2018 just Everything dipped to low thousands. Still made a few thousands. 

Sometime in 2019 I bought a good bit of bitcoin and I still had a ton of ltc and Ethr laying around. Decided to not fuck with it. And then popped off this year. And then I started investing in crypto again recently after bitcoin passed 15k mark. Things have gone up more in BTC, ETHR, and LTC than altcoins. More so BTC and ETHR. But LTC is doing just trucking along 

They are backbones. I mainly invest in those three. And then what happens with alt coins is just what happens. If it peaks and goes off crazy and I make a huge profit then awesome. 

If it goes back to the pennies then it is what it is. I'm content with it. 

Goal is to eventually pay off home mortgage. Once I get that amount to pay it off I'll probably empty it pay the taxes and pay off the home loan. 

Honestly the Peace I felt when my parents home loan was finished was great. I want that. It takes off a lot of stress. Property tax and HOA is a huge reduction than monthly mortgage.",downtimeredditor,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mnozjj/no_matter_how_new_you_are_to_crypto_you_are_in_a/,"No matter how new you are to crypto, you are in a unique position!"

I think Elon could have pumped the market to get out, not because he was getting in. He pushed the tops a little higher and spruced up some short-term belief in the market. He possibly dumped at the top of the spike after the announcement.    
He put a decent effort into shilling doge while buying into BTC in order to redirect market share for cheaper prices, it’s not really far-fetched that he’d do the polar opposite.

Then of course suddenly DOGE went to $.40. Like that moment basically. The mark where the rocket went straight up in the DOGE chart? That's where I cashed out small profit from RH.

So guess who bought back in on RH (fraction of old 20k) to at least deal in DOGE at around $.30? I'm fomo sorry seriously. Where tf do we go to do DOGE, BTC, ETH, LTC, etc etc etc etc right? All I have for crypto is Coinbase and RH (I get they're not ""my coins"" in RH tho)

 I don't blame the new comer, do ur research and u will know the value. My only complaint is few youtuber/twitter (huge influencer in the XRP space) are promoted the pump and hold as a good thing to help people notice XRP. Were in the top 10 coin they can research xrp by looking at that and why it still up there.

OMI is the first time I've invested outside of index funds. Many people roaring in here are *vastly* misinformed about realistic investment returns. 

VeVe is what I perceive to be a great product...and I wanted to speculate -- simple as that. I got in just below a dollar. Of course I wish I had gotten in sooner, but I still believe there is room to grow. Getting to even $.02 by the end of the year would be a FANTASTIC result. I'm in this for the long run.

That being said...ravenous speculators expecting quick 10x+ on their money are fine, but I think they are going to be massively disappointed in the near future.

5532,2021-03-31 16:18:11,"Thanks for your post - a good read. I agree with most of your points - point 5 - invest in the company, not the market... i agree and disagree with this.  There is good short term money to be made through investing in value in the market although many beginners can lose out with the wrong entry. All of my long term holdings (about 75% of portfolio) are in companies that i believe in... the remaining 25% is in market opportunities that may be for a few days, weeks or months.

Personally i'm a little (not much) more bullish on price but as you say we're all just guessing really and a number of things need to fall into place to see a significant rise (more licences, good quality and exclusive licensing, increased veve customers, increase number of drops, catering for more global customer base through enabling access and accessible drop times etc).  I personally don't think of it as a crypto - its a very different type of product and project to ETH, ADA BNB etc. If it gets mainstream adoption from people who don't understand crypto then the collectibles business is one of the most lucrative given the emotional pull from collectors to collect.",gibbondog,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecomi/comments/mgwwvq/for_new_investors_some_thoughts_on_price/,"For new investors: Some thoughts on price predictions, selling, and asking for advice"

So question is, if I am a seller, why would I just lower my sell price if a whale came in and put in a large sell order under mine? As long as mark price is still above mine, wouldn’t the process fill buy/sells in order closest to mark price?

Now I could see if people saw a massive sell order placed way under current mark, that could create panic and people may initiate sells that weren’t planning too driving market lower, but if I already had a sell, why would I adjust it lower just cause someone put in a sell at a point lower than mine?",brownsd18,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantomFoundation/comments/m1xixo/how_crypto_whales_manipulate_the_market_how_to/,How Crypto Whales Manipulate the Market + How to defend against them

5619,2021-02-14 07:46:09,"Basic rule is to get your initial investment out as fast as you can. Especially when this represent a large chunk of your savings.

Protect your gain even if they are not at the max.

Eg. You put all your savings on ADA last week and made it to 100% ? Congratulation. Bring back half on your bank account, sell another 25% to reinvest into other crypto and keep 25% on ADA. It moons, it moons, it crashes like 2018, it crashes.

You'll end up richer no matter what. And if it does crash and the market turns bearish ... GTFO of it asap.

Source: Got burnt in 2018. Went from 10K to 100K to 10K again because I refused to sell. Had to liquidate some position, reinvest in some coin to reduce their average purchasing price.

5622,2021-02-14 13:27:34,"The exit strategy is what I really get hung up on because it seems like 9 out of 10 times that I've tried exiting I've come to regret it. Looking back at the numbers through coin tracking software I can see that had I just held onto my BTC, ETH, and LTC rather than entering and exiting the market I would have made astronomically higher gains than I've seen up to this point. I've been involved since my early 20's starting in 2016 to 2017 having no idea what I was doing.

My tentative plan is to continue holding for the next five to ten years while also taking advantage of dollar cost averaging. I honestly don't have the confidence to figure out when to pull out of the markets and I'm beginning to suspect that that's one of my biggest weaknesses. I've already moved past some of the most fundamental mistakes that people make in this space chasing pumps, hoping on specific altcoins, and not holding long enough but I feel like I've still got a long way to go.

I'm going to work on trying to figure things out. I think that learning about the best ways of pulling out certain percentages of crypto into fiat rather than 100% is a good starting point to investigate how to structure an exit strategy.

5633,2021-02-14 08:27:34,"Is this cycle different? Companies are investing hundreds of millions and governments are talking about adopting blockchain technology. I think this will make this cycle more stable, but I do think there is a mania over crypto. Maybe this mania is justified because of early adoption, but tough to know what the ceiling is - DYOR, but I’ve read that about 1% of people have been exposed, and the US has $39 trillion in circulation [?] and crypto all together has a market cap around $1T, with BTC making up 2/3. This info is a couple months dated, but this is what I’m basing my decisions on, assuming that wider adoption will be a great multiplier, and with support from governments and private sector, I don’t think crypto will fall as hard, but I’d imagine it would be due for a correction sometime in the near future. I think the use cases envisioned for cryptos like NuCypher and the IoT types are a couple years away from meaningful adoption. I remember reading another article about the biggest bubbles in history, and it noted that in no other instance did a market come back the way crypto did. I couldn’t find the article, I remember it talked about the Dutch tulip bubble and Polish equities, but I found this for some reference: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062315/five-largest-asset-bubbles-history.asp",FermyJay,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lje45l/please_be_smart_during_this_cycle/,Please be smart during this cycle...

5636,2021-02-14 09:40:46,"Thanks for the post, I totally agree.  I feel like a lot of news coming soon and the shift from fiat to crypto is finally rising up due to so many factors that is quite different than the crash in 2017.   

Since 2017, I feel crypto has had much time to improve itself, such as ADA Cardano using this time to perfect the their roll out.  I think a lot of people discovered stocks and crypto from Robinhood showing the power of retail investors.  With Covid-19 as a huge world pandemic but also a huge catalyst in changing the shape of everything we know.   People are losing a lot of fiat from lockdowns, business failures, job losses, etc but people are making a lot of gains in the stock market and speculation.   With US issuing a 1.9 Trillion Stimulus, a hedge against inflation is rising.  
The news last week with Tesla 1.5 Bil in BTC, all these bullish predictions setting a ceiling on BTC and ETH is psychologically a self fulfilling prophecy as these coins look cheap as they are well below the ceiling now and still time to buy more.   VISA and MasterCard also announcing cryptocurrency processing with banks coming soon, I am seeing institutions all scrambling to capitalize on this current bull run cycle.  

Although I held in 2017 and tanked with it, I still held on until now with a little rebalancing of my coins my portfolio has increased along with this larger crypto bull cycle.   Fortunately I diversified rather than holding all in 1 coin, and I held 3% of my portfolio in LINK back in 2017 that has skyrocketed to cover my entire portfolio by itself.  So although I held a lot of shitcoins, I also held a lot of good ones.   For me, the opportunity is too great this time and I want every coin to get that chance to rise.  It is very exciting times and I still thinking we can still run up much more.   Everyone has their own risk tolerances and their own life situations.

5698,2021-02-14 18:04:32,"Ok, here is my current position.
Don't know if I'm being smart or stupid.
Saw the buzz coming for doge and invested fast.
Not a crazy amount but certainly about the limit of what I could afford to lose.
I followed doge all the way to its peak and watched with increasing doubt about it's future short term gain.
Set a stop limit and got out with a healthy £5000 profit.

I've now invested some of the profits in to various projects. I've looked on posts for coins with a lot of social chatter and moonshot potential and I've invested in them with a minor amount and these I'm just leaving. If they die they die if they don't then all good.

Projects that I feel have a future I have researched and invested a little more heavily. I fully expect everything to dip in the coming months but feel these projects are changing the future and as such will flourish long term.

Current position
I can withdraw my initial investment.
I can withdraw profits on that investment.
I have a diverse portfolio that's got around 10 coins.
3 of those are long term serious investments.
3 are long term moonshots.
4 are projects I like but I don't believe they have long term potential but do have some short term gains.

I can walk at this point with double my investment, still have funds to invest and a portfolio with what I consider some good longterm safe assets.

I am new to investing.

As far as institutions are concerned the ones that are getting in from the same fiat trading point of view are a danger I agree, but there should be a study on their buying sentiments.",ronoda12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lje45l/please_be_smart_during_this_cycle/,Please be smart during this cycle...

5751,2021-02-17 21:10:34,"Indeed, this time is ALWAYS different in some respects, but the market hasn't suddenly matured into the NASDAQ overnight. There is still going to be a lot of volatility until the market matures enough for the fundamentals of great Alts to stand on their own two feet and decouple from BTCs price action.

Learn from your past mistakes. A receding tide is still going to maroon all ships, for now at least. Potentially, in the next cycle, the cryptosphere will be mature enough to build a foundation that won't get wiped out.

Alas, it seems you are aware that Crypto Winter is Coming. Probably, as soon as most of the world is re-opened for leisure, travel, socialisation and rampant consumerism, because demand for cash will go through the roof = liquidity crisis for alts in particular.

Why not take some profits by DCAing out into stable coin yields and earn some interest that you can then DCA back in on the dips or for the next major accumulation phase?",ArtyHobo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/llwcth/this_time_is_different/,This time IS different...

We are not really though, are we? Most people here are just in it for the speculation. Sure increased price / market cap might be necessary step for adoption, but the total investment coming from members of this sub probably doesnt amount to much of the total BTC value.

>I just wish that it would slow down a little bit because this is getting silly.

Corrections will come when it increases too fast. The days and weeks of -20% isnt pretty, but is predictable, and a natural part of the process.

5842,2021-04-21 18:21:49,"13 days ago I bought 25 billion elongates
When I saw the first dip I panic sold and at the end bought again. The result? With the same money I was able to buy back 17 BLN only. I must have burned like 5000 EUR of profit on that transaction alone

Then again the price fell and my initial 3k investment from being worth 7000 went down all the way down to 2000, I freaked out for two straight days, BUT I HOLDED.
Result? 4 days later that same coins were worth 14500.
I took out 4000 (initial 3k invested +1000 profit) and I had another 9000 left in the wallet.

Morale? Just hold and if you can, buy more 
As soon as I saw the dip this time I put another 2000 dollars in.
Even if price goes down a little it will rise back much higher.

The right time to finish a position and take a profit is subjective. What you shouldn't do is get greedy. Greed has taken many users for their wealth on this sub. Any profit is good profit.

One other note is that you should invest to build wealth not to pay for cancer.
This is purely an example, suppose your treatment costs $1000 and you have all of your capital in one investment. You make a good trade and it increases in value to 900. You wait until it reaches $1000. But then it decreases in value to 700 and never reaches 900 again.

Also, I wish I learned this before but short term tax rate is the same as ordinary income tax based on what you make.

The higher the price of bitcoin the more people would want to join which could result in a better profit and more demands for their fund.

ADA was $.40 less than two months ago and $1.50ish when it launched on Coinbase Pro. I think the ADA community thought that the Coinbase members would pump it back up the next day and that never happened.

5873,2021-03-25 07:18:29,"So I’ll say this, my experience (1.5 months)  has almost been exactly yours from timing to even the invested coins. I was even preparing a similar write up.

Some points and tips while we are in the same boat. 

First and foremost get a good portfolio app. I use Coinbase (for staking) and Coinbase pro. 
I use CoinStats and Delta to track my portfolio. Both are good with just the basic free app. 

I started out with a similar strategy of diversification mostly evenly with slightly greater weight on mainstream coins like BTC and ETH. Quickly found my portfolio growing more lopsided with certain coins. Next investment drop I adopted a 1,3,5 strategy. 
0-1% in negative gaining coins, 3% additional to 0-15% increase coins. 5% additional to 15% increase coins. 

Very happy with portfolio. Also got some coins specifically just for their staking. 

Also got caught up in the ADA mess and massacre. I DCAed out well before it current lows and hold a much smaller amount now. If you’re holding still then it probably can’t get much worse so that’s a good thing. Either way, good write up, I was going to write up something similar but I glad someone else did it.",michaelmikado,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mck3bh/a_few_thoughts_from_a_cryptobeginner_while_the/,A few thoughts from a crypto-beginner while the market is down

6015,2021-02-17 20:48:30,As this is newb friendly can someone quickly explain how people made so much on the GME calls. My basic understanding is people brought huge lots of long dated OTM calls at ridiculous strikes of $60 (when the share was $2) these calls were worth nothing as no one expected the share to rocket to that level. Add in margin and people made fortunes. Am I close ?

6075,2021-03-31 06:08:44,"Great write up, thank you! I watched the video but wasn’t able to get near as many points as you laid out here.

Question about deflation. In your example there’s 100 million Eth and 1 million is burned per years. First is that $1m each year or .99 the second year .981 the third, etc. 

Assuming the latter, are Eth developers really looking at building a logarithmically decreasing money supply? That seems so extreme. I was imagining you would see some tiny reduction in the total that didn’t increase, but also didn’t really diminish the total pot. This way I’m 50 years were at maybe 70 million Eth.

6090,2021-04-24 16:20:18,"This is very interesting. 

I think one of the things that escapes the proponents of Bitcoin is that POW might not allow Bitcoin to ever penetrate into the mainstream. What the Bitcoin proponents argue is that POW's power consumption should be seen as a good thing - I call this the ""bitcoin as a battery narrative"". This might be true. What is often missed is that it does not matter if it's true or not, if the general perception of Bitcoin is that it's a massively wasteful system - a narrative that is already penetrated the story told about Bitcoin - whether one likes it or not. 

This is often missed. 

One can image a not-so-distant future where a company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet might be seen as a company which contributes to global warming, green house emotions, is selfish by doing so, and so on. 

Whether this thesis is correct or not on a factual basis does not matter if it is being held by a group of people powerful enough (what Nassim Taleb calls the dictatorship of a loud minority) to bring the heat to the public by holding this narrative. And public companies hate controversies. They care not if Bitcoin is a good investment if the brand might caught cross-fire from a loud minority which might tarnish their brand. 

I can already see a group of these loud minorities holding up signs outside of Sturbux saying ""this company is polluting the earth. Ban Bitcoin now"". 

Even if these annoying group of people are wrong, they might be loud enough to create the narrative. We can see for example the reputation done to nuclear power plants as an example - humanities best energy resource was abandoned because of public perception of it - not by what it actually was. This is a critical point to understand. 

I think humanity has reached a point it its perception of technology that tech should bring a bettering of society. And I think that hundreds of articles written about Bitcoin's ability to become a store of energy might not be enough to change the public view of it - especially in the face of POS alternatives - as a technological progress.",asl2dwncb29dakjn3daj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mglu8u/how_ethereum_can_become_a_multitrillion_dollar/,How Ethereum can become a multi-trillion dollar asset: A summary of Bankless Episode #57 Ultra Sound Money

Also, generally it isn't a positive sign when a coin claims to be a disruptor.

Wait for a pullback or crash or whatever and when it comes put your remainder 3/4 in to BTC.  This way you’re in the market if we go to the moon and a pullback never comes and at the same time it prepares us mentally for seeing a “crash” as a buy in opportunity,I_was_bone_to_dance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lz1taw/a_beginners_guide_to_dyor_do_your_own_research/,A Beginner's Guide to DYOR (Do Your Own Research)

6171,2021-03-07 00:31:14,"My opinion on a less risky investment is too set a long term goal, ideally no shorter than 5 years. Gradually increase holdings through a Cost average approach over a period of say a year depending on the holdings desired. I wish I had have known this when first investing. It would have taken the emotion out of the equation much earlier and reduced some FOMO bad decisions. 

Just as important as Hodling is understanding where the technology is going. there is no point having 20 moon shots at $100 a pop if you don't understand the vision of the project.  Think who will benefit and to what level will institutions adapt the technology as they will hold up the system during bear markets. Blockchain is the what really excites me and I can see a future where is has widespread adaptation through smart contracts & NFT. 

Therefore projects like ETH & ADA are my favorites followed by what I think as safe bets like BTC & LTC as they are already kinda mainstream. Finally its nice to have a few long shots to make things abit more interesting. I like XMR & NANO as they both have great working products just waiting for the mainstream to swoop it up. 

Most important, don't trust strangers and hype men when it comes to a project.

Isn't price influenced by more factors like volume of trades, who gets in to back it up, or what else have we ... because i failed to understand how does a fully diluted market cap tell the price story? 

Let's say you have dunno, i'll use XLM for example, you have this Alt at 0.4 dollars , with a 45% supply in circulation ... now the Spectacular tool our colleague did tells us if the total supply would be in circulation , don't forget, Mcap=price x supply in circulation, the cap Price would be arround 20 bucks , but i fail to understand how does the Total Supply into circulation limit the price in any way shape or form? ... I mean, can't the price be at one point , 40 dollars per token for example? So the total supply is already in circulation,  the model actually tells us that there is no way a XLM would be able to pass 20 dollar/coin but i simply don't understand how can supply tell the story of price alone !? By all means it simply doesn't ... there are way more external factors that drive the price up no matter how much supply is in circulation. 

If i use this alone it means DoT has reached price cap at 40 dollars ... so there is no point to Ever Buy DOT, right? since it's already at 33.

However, we have less influence than the likes of, say, Ark Investments. Cathie Wood has made it clear, she will not hold if the price takes a big knock. All of the big dogs have set automatic stop losses on Bitcoin. They will bail if we see another huge crash. We don't know where those stop losses are, but they will have a domino effect. If one kicks in, the price will drop disproportionately, and the others will follow. Volatility helps in the long run to stabilise at a fair market price. However, many of the little people will feel unable to hold if the price crashes following a true whale exodus. Institutions have to protect their shareholders and investors. They are not ideological. Ideological attachment combines with a lack of understanding of what Bitcoin is or what its function is, combines with a belief that people and markets are rational. This is a heady, intoxicating blend, and it should not blind us to the fact that there is this danger in Bitcoin. We are only protected if we truly can hodl no matter what. But the market doesn't care about any of us, and we can't blame anyone who bails at the first sign of trouble.",Squirida,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m65bju/bitcoins_regular_1030_corrections_ultimately/,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger"

6205,2021-03-16 22:16:19,"Agree 100%. If Bitcoin didn't deflate occasionally, it WOULD become a bubble which would ultimately pop. Much rather get these deflations along the way rather than have them build up into a massive explosion later.

These corrections shake out weaker hands, allow stronger hands to accumulate, and shows everyone the next potential ATH. Then, the previous ATH ""bubble"" becomes the new support, and the cycle repeats.

6206,2021-03-16 23:24:26,"My guess is that the volatility is proportional to the difference between two different real values of bitcoin. One real value is the current utility of bitcoin, it's current network effects, it's current feature set, etc. The other real value is its future utility of bitcoin. This is where the technology is going, how big it's network will get, and how valuable that will make it. I think the volatility is so large because the current utility is so much less than the future utility. Those who don't look into the future only see the current utility and say ""it can't be worth this much, I'm selling"", but forget that market's like to try to price in the future. The people who looks to see where bitcoin is going in the next 10 years often see a future where bitcoin is widely used as a global currency, and see that the market price is nowhere near what it would be if that happened. 

The market price is somewhere in between and fluctuates down towards it's current utility and fluctuates up towards it's future utility. The volatility hasn't gone down much because the market price hasn't gotten very close to it's future utility. When that happens, we'll stop seeing these crazy swings.",fresheneesz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m65bju/bitcoins_regular_1030_corrections_ultimately/,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger"

This neuters EIP-1559 without forking the chain.  Other miners can defect all they want (and mine big blocks), but since their chain is never extended, they never actually receive the block rewards/tips.

When blocks are always `gas_target` or smaller, users will revert to first-price auctions via `tip`, which reverts the system back to its current state.

6370,2021-02-17 08:19:20,"The ratio has taken a bit of a hit but it's still reasonable. BTC is going to be the big star and I don't get bored of seeing $50k on the ticker. My only regret is trading. I should have held since I bought Bitcoin all those years ago but I've done a lot of good with my profits so no regrets. OK, small regrets.

So where it stands now is how solid is that $50k. We're kind of being screwed by both sides of this:

* BTC spiking means everyone is dumping the ratio to buy more BTC
* BTC dumping means altcoins will dump harder

What needs to happen is for BTC to simmer down and go sideways. That's when alt's catch up and often surpass BTC. I see something similar here. After all, BTC going from $46k to $50k is a 10% gain but LTC just went from $185 to $225 which is a 20%+ gain so as far as your investment, LTC is the new ETH. LTC has been gaining on ETH for 10 days now, in fact.

I think LTC is going to keep going higher. BTC doesn't seem like it's going to pull a spike to something like $55k and tank and we have one more boost to wait for... the March stimulus is going to pass which will continue to devalue the dollar which will give crypto another adrenaline shot in the arm. As LTC creeps higher, someone is going to realize that it's going to go parabolic since all the resistance levels are being cleared. LTC had a particularly tough time in the $225 range and that's where we've been for a bit. Once we move forward safely beyond $230, this should only hit psychological levels of $250/275/300 and so forth but no real reason not to go parabolic as far as resistance.

6379,2021-02-28 06:31:07,"How can I explain this quickly...? Ok, it’s like this...the ETH dumps are because of the BTC dumps. The BTC gets dumped before the last Friday of the futures contract (CME) which is the last Friday of the month. This has happened consistently every month. People that don’t know call it a market correction or make up some other mythical excuse. When a whale, or F2 Pool dumps about 3000 BTC the last week of the month, they flood the market with BTC and the price drops. Then the weekend after they have REkT the market, they buy all of their BTC back at a much lower price...and they’ll do it again at the end of March. The same thing is trying to be done with ETH but it isn’t always as successful. But you have to know that when BTC drops, the whole market drops. When BTC drops, people sell off ETH to buy BTC at a lower price. When they sell their ETH, it also floods the market with extra ETH and the price of it also drops. Chain reactions. Watch BTC inflows and outflows and search CryptoRUs on YouTube for the truth. It can help your buy/sell strategy. If you have ANY extra money, right now, buy BTC...as much as you can...and sell around March 21st or so.

6393,2020-11-28 01:23:54,"Here is [my response](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fvdtom/money_printer_go_brrr/fmilqmj/) whenever Tether FUD raises its head:

tl;dr:

The price goes up way more *before* a Tether grant than it does after. This is consistent with Tether being granted in response to demand, rather then to fraudulently inflate the price.

Here's a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bmKa-fXCzWA_HpDhIa-z-AylhxRpH683z2QT6rlqPis/edit?usp=sharing) I did back in June last year.

I tracked all Tether controlled actions from 2014 until June of 2019, when I gave up. This is across all blockchains at the time, which were BTC, ETH, and TRON.

Sheet 1 has every day, sheet 2 has just the Tether actions.

Looking at the grants and prints (""grants""), there were 83 total. I have identified the amount of each grant as well as the percentage of the BTC market cap and BTC daily volume of each one as of the date of each grant.

The Price 30 before (column M) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
> (BTC closing price on date of grant) / (BTC closing price 30 days prior to grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price the day of the grant was $330.08. 30 days prior, the price was $484.83.
> 
> $330.08/$484.83 = 68.08%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price is higher on the date of the grant than it was 30 days before the grant was made.

The Price 10 before (column N) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
> (BTC closing price on date of grant) / (BTC closing price 10 days prior to grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price the day of the grant was $330.08. 10 days prior, the price was $404.42.
> 
> $330.08/$404.42 = 81.62%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price is higher on the date of the grant than it was 10 days before the grant was made.

The Price 30 after (column O) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
>  (BTC closing price 30 days after grant) / (BTC closing price on date of grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price 30 days after the grant was $339.49. On the day of the grant, the closing price was $330.08.
> 
> $339.49/$330.08 = 102.85%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price increased 30 days after the grant was made. If the entry in this column is <100% then the price decreased 30 days after the grant was made.

The Price 10 after (column P) is reflected as a percentage and reflects: 
> 
>  (BTC closing price 10 days after grant) / (BTC closing price on date of grant)
> 
> So for the first grant of $100.00, the closing price 10 days after the grant was $382.56. On the day of the grant, the closing price was $330.08.
> 
> $382.56/$330.08 = 115.92%
>
>If the entry in this column is >100%, then the price increased 10 days after the grant was made. If the entry in this column is <100% then the price decreased 10 days after the grant was made.

At the bottom of each column on Sheet 2 is the average for each column.

We can see that for the average of Price 30 before (column M) is 128.19%. On days that Tether was granted, on average, the price was 28.19% higher than it was 30 days prior. 56 of the 83 Tether grants were made on days that were more than 100% compared to 30 days prior. Only 27 grants were made on days where the price was lower than 30 days prior.

Similarly, for the Price 10 before (column N), on days that Tether was granted, on average, the price was ~6% higher than it was 10 days before. 49 grants were made on days where the price was more than 100% of the price 10 days prior. Only 34 grants were made on days where the price was lower than 10 days prior.

On the other hand, when you look at the Price 30 after (column O), on average, 30 days after a Tether grant, the price changed by an average of 15%. For 43 Tether grants, the price was higher 30 days after the grant than it was the day of the grant. For 40 grants, the price was lower 30 days after the grant than the day of the grant.

And similarly, for the Price 10 after (column P), on average, 10 days after a Tether grant, the price increased by an average of 4%. For 46 grants, the price was higher 10 days after the grant compared to the price the day of the grant, leaving the other 37 to be lower 10 days after the grant.

If Tether were totally legit, what would we expect to see? Grants would be more likely, but not exclusively, to be made, *after* significant positive price changes. We would expect to see more grants made when the price is locally high. I would suggest that is what this data reflects.

If Tether were a scam used to pump BTC or cryptocurrency, then we would expect to see that the price after a grant would be significantly greater than the price at or prior to a grant. We would expect that the price following a grant would be significantly greater than the price prior to and during a grant. I would suggest that this data does not show that. While the data does show that the average price increases following a grant, this increase is not to the same extent as the price increases *prior to* each grants.",Shortupdate,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/k1tzvx/daily_discussion_friday_november_27_2020/,"[Daily Discussion] Friday, November 27, 2020"

6397,2020-11-28 07:36:12,"Having a really tough time reading this market. While I'm bullish in the medium- to long-term, my instincts are that we'll revisit the 16,300 region that we touched yesterday, as support hasn't really been established anywhere near where we're trading now. 

Inflows of crypto to exchanges are at their highest levels since March '20; this has historically preceded significant dumps fairly reliably. [Source](https://www.coindesk.com/quick-bitcoin-price-recovery-looks-in-doubt-as-whales-move-coins-onto-exchanges)

As the price hovers a few thousand USD below ATH, jittery bears or traumatized 2017-era vets will be looking for any strong signal to cash out, which could very quickly lead to a major retracement imo. 

At the same time, the longer we vacillate around the 16.8-17.5k region, the more this starts to look like semi-solid support, and this could rather quickly re-instill confidence in buyers and affirm the immediate primacy of the longer-term bullish signals we're all watching.

The real answer, more often than not, is miners. Pools who have a LOT, lot more bitcoin than anybody else, and dont particularly want the price to increase massively any time soon. It's in the best interest of the bigger pools to keep the price low to eventually punch out the little pools who dont have enough BTC to dump to cover their costs, and if they do dump it, it's going to be at a low price pretty much determined by bigger pools. The less BTC they have, and the less they get paid for it, the more likely they are to retreat from mining due to not covering costs or donate / join their hash power with the bigger pools monopoly.

Sure, a lot of it is natural market sentiment, whales, bla bla. But miners play a much more drastic role in the price than most people want to believe.",PEAWK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ll8w29/who_keeps_selling_at_50k_volume/,Who keeps selling at 50k? Volume?

6498,2021-04-23 03:21:50,"So theory one yes it is a good way to launder money, picked a coin that listed on few exchanges, if you know the devs or own the wallets with most coins it not hard to have the price pumped high and hard for anyone to crash the price.  I can not see if it a mining coin or POS or fully minted, but again these factors will potentially limit the ability for anyone to crash the price.

I can pick holes in your theory two.

First they did not transfer 1,211,455,065,226 USD into the coin... they have pumped the price up on relatively low volume, many coins are not on the exchange that was traded.

Also IF the government was going to migrate to a crypto... why would they pick some random shitcoin no one has heard of to build confidence in a fair to all new system?? On sketchy exchanges that no one heard of or uses?

Only some banks were up late into the night... there was no sign of Blackrock staying up late? and are they not supposed to be THE bank that wants to be or is a government bank... would they not be the ones that are helping fund and launch the crypto to migrate the USD to. 

Finally if you look at the trading you can see it was only about 22 million that was pumped into the coin on one exchange. The two other exchanges are still pegged at low $ price  

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/capital-x-cell/markets/

Personally none of this adds up as necessarily being HF or any large whale.... It could easily be someone who put 200k into btc back in 2018 and held till now, then pumping this coin to try be a whale of their own or has issued the coin themselves and pumping it...

UPDATE: ran a whois lookup on the domain and it was registered in 2019... so doubtful a project they been planning since 2019 was needing all night work from the top bankers imo.... I would really hope they are not leaving migrating to crypto to the night before it due like a final test or essay.

6581,2021-02-24 02:02:08,"> Is crypto a scam, I only started INVESTING in crypto last few months

You're already invested and then you ask ""is crypto a scam?"" Now why would you invest without educating yourself? 

Those big sellers aren't bears, they're whales, they've been long on BTC, and they're taking profits.
 
As to answer the ""why other coins follow btc?""

Its because most coins are heavily traded against BTC. Lets say Bitcoin usd value goes down 30%, the value of the altcoin in usd also goes down about same %. But if you look at it's value in btc, it's only gone down a small % or is relatively stable. 

To your last part about every coin seems to be pumping and some. There are plenty of coins considered as shitcoins, and those are pumped and dumped, so you need to do your research and know about what you're investing in. As for other altcoins, Low market cap means a low amount of money into a coin will move things up at an exceptional rate, an influx on 1m can move a small cap coin in a parabolic path. You then see a retracement because some people will take profits.

> At least in stocks you have time to react

One of the first things that people learn when getting into crypto is that it's extremely volatile and up to 30% price movements (up or down) are extremely common.

You seem fairly panicked, so here's my two cents.

This may be a small retracement on the bull run of BTC, or may be the start of a bear market. Nobody knows. When investing or trading, you need to have a plan, a timeframe you wanna be in the market for, a strategy, an exit plan, and define your risk tolerance. 

Example: let's say I swing trade BTC without margin. My plan is to buy 5k worth of BTC, my risk tolerance is 20%, so I set a stop loss at 20% (20% is my risk tolerance on this trade, which is very high btw), if it goes up, my strategy is to keep adding to my position and moving my stop limits higher and higher, so I'm out of a negative/loss stop limit position. 

Let's say I'm investing for 5 years, I DCA 100$ every week and I think in those 5 years BTC will reach 100k, now my plan is to wait for a big uptrend in that 5 years and when the uptrend starts I slowly start pulling out profits as it gets higher and higher. I don't just sit and wait for it to go all the way up to 100k, that would be stupid, I can't predict what price is gonna be the high of a bull run.

Have a fucking plan, is my point here.

I don't mean to sound rude here, but it seems like you've jumped in without doing your homework and you don't even know some proper terms or basics about the market in general. I advise you to always research in depth, anything you decide to invest in. I mean anything, not just in the crypto space.",damittydam,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqr8we/is_crypto_a_scam/,Is crypto a scam?

Not only is BTC leagues ahead of other coins by market cap, it also has a ton of trading pairs to other alts. BTC quite literally dictates the entire crypto market.

As for the stock market, most Securities are correlated with each other. That's why you see similar moves from the same companies and indices day by day. My point is, you do see correlations like this in the stock market too.

6603,2020-11-24 07:53:00,">XRP has been releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow accounts, every month, for the entire bear market.

They have released 1 Billion XRP from escrow every month for the last 35 months in a row, and they have another 55 months worth of escrow contracts.  Care to guess how much of that 35 Billion XRP got locked back up tho? (this is the part you're missing)

>They used this to dump on investors

They used that money to BUILD the highways and gas stations for their network and Main holdings to increase in value and succeed as a company.  Fun fact, if you look at XRP Sold by Ripple over the last 35 months and look at Newly Mined BTC. Guess which is ""dumping"" more. (its BTC btw)  

Heres the problem, in the BTC system the Miners only cares are to increase their hashrate to collect more profits, or Pay of their hardware/electrical/housing bills.  0$ of the BTC they sell goes back to Fuel network development or to improve the network.  BTC is a bathtub with the water pouring in but the plug isnt it so all the water going in is just going right out the bottom, no money is being spent on development.  Meanwhile When ripple sells, it isnt to buy more control of the network, its to fund partnerships or actually BUILD the network... This is the difference you dont seem to grasp.

>Then, after most of this original community and investors capitulate, they announce a buyback ,times with a BTC rally and they pump the price

They were buying back not just last quarter but the quarter before that, they talk about it in their quarterly reports that theyve been releasing since 2015...The BTC pump has nothing to do with them ""buying XRP to pump the price"" again go check their Q1 2020 report...

>I genuinely just think this type of market practice is unethical and should be highlighted to the community.

6608,2020-11-24 08:35:21,"> So, let me get this straight, XRP has been releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow accounts, every month, for the entire bear market.

They started their monthly escrow just BEFORE the 2017 bull run - not sure what your point is about it happening in a crypto-wide bear market?

> They used this to dump on investors and used the money to build Ripple, the physical company.

How is a highly controlled monthly escrow release (with all which isn't sold going BACK to escrow) ""dumping""?  And even if you still think it is, they let everybody know way way in advance (2017).  If people don't like the idea of Ripple's escrow, I have a top-tip for them: don't buy XRP! 

> Then, after most of this original community and investors capitulate, they announce a buyback, times with a BTC rally and they pump the price, causing another retail FOMO and gains of like 100% in a week.

Whose fault is it if people buy high and sell low? Yes, there are many people who bought deep into the last (crypto-wide) bull-run and capitulated at some point in the 2 year (crypto-wide, I might add) bear market.

6610,2020-11-24 11:12:55,"Good comments... except you're wrong.  Respectfully go research the escrow... 1 billion get UNLOCKED per month... that doesn't mean they're dumped on the market.  It's unfortunate it gets reported wrong (intentionally?), and talked about incorrectly on here (either because of bad information or again intentionally?).

It's all public information... which makes the ""reporting"" so ruddiculous.  There have been months where 100% goes back into escrow (yet because they're unlocked crypto media ""reports"" or infers that are getting dumped on the market.  And last sales from escrow I looked at (some time ago) for a quarter... something like 96% were returned to escrow... the 4% Ripple sold to their partner was for liquidity purposes the buyer was contractually obligated not to dump on the free market... again no XRP hitting the free market.  That's not it say it never happens... but not like its ""reported"".  

There are no perfect projects.  I personally don't like the fact Ripple (the company) controls so much XRP (escrow or not).

6667,2021-03-21 15:29:32,"I would like to add the infamous rug pull so frequent in DeFi nowadays. The one where the contracts suddenly alters its behaviour, either because the developers actively change the code or because it has a built in timer and change in one of the following way:

- make it impossible to withdraw and/or convert the token back to the quote currency of the pair

- mint an insane amount of tokens assigned to a wallet they control

In both cases the value of the token almost instantly drops to zero while the devs siphon out all the liquidity from the pool and run away with everyone's BTC/stable coin

Particularly dangerous because even a reasonable amount of DD won't raise many red flag because the original tokenomics of the project may seems fine and fair, before the contract changes.

6918,2021-03-03 06:55:00,"Good and valuable things often make money. I will never see nothing wrong with making money unless it is at the clear expense of the others.

In my current country of residence, for example, physicians are looked down and even shamed for asking any kind of compensation despite it is being, you know, job. I quit the practice because it was an example of hypocrisy. ""Helping people"" honestly for me is the unintended secondary effect of doing that job. However, there are a few people that were very vocal about vaccines and spouting conspiracy theories like ""doctors are just trying to control you!!! Wake up sheeple!"" had made me *cringed* so hard to the point that I quit.

I get most of my income from freelancing working on unreasonable academic demands of resident physicians in my country of residence (unreasonable defined as 10 page of academic work, presented tomorrow and the said physician in on shift for 24 hours, when will he/she has the time to research, write, let alone make a presentation); let's just say from one perspective, I'm perpetuating the issue of academic dishonesty. Me? I think there is a profit to be made, I provide them service so that they can rest easier and treat their patient without staying up 1 month on fuckload of stimulants (surgical residents do not sleep, they fall asleep, hopefully not on the operating table).

What I am trying to say is that the things that make you money are not necessarily bad things; if you believe in the tech, just do it. Besides, if it is sounds good and reasonable, it is an opportunity. Life is too short for debating that what you choose is noble or not; not harming people is noble enough in my book.

6967,2021-03-03 02:14:46,"With Strike and LN, not to mention wrapping coins on other chains, I expect second layer transactions will become scalable at some point in the future. Given this, I think it is actually nuts that people plan on pulling out of BTC. If you don't believe in the project's long-term viability, sure that makes sense... but if you do believe in it... what are you even thinking?

There was a time where hodl didn't just mean *""oh I'll pull out when moon $$$""*. It meant actually **HODL**. Keep it. Don't let go. Bitcoin has already  achieved viability as a store of value. MicroStrategy is just the forerunner among institutions planning on holding Bitcoin. Many thought the ""store of value"" claim was a death knell for Bitcoin only four years ago. Well, it is 2021 and Bitcoin is fine. Additionally, second layer projects are doing fine. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin won't scale hasn't been paying attention, or simply doesn't believe in Bitcoin's future. If scaling didn't happen the way you expect, or as fast as you hoped, at least recognize it is happening.

If you want to recoup your initial investment, crystalize gains, or anything like that, go nuts. You can be a responsible investor while still hodling long-term... but if you are in crypto and don't understand what you've invested in, maybe it's time to learn. Planning to cash out at an arbitrary level that satisfies your greed is both poor investing and very naïve.

You want a market with commodities that go through explosive volatility netting you 2000% gains in the next five years? Maybe buy some crypto company's stock. Lots of mining companies are still small cap. This isn't financial advice. This is just my hot take. Hodl like the enthusiasts of 2017 and earlier. DYOR and learn what success looks like for Bitcoin, and other crypto. To quote an old meme:

Selling now? I'll leave that to the new guys with weak stomachs.

Or even worse, they buy in during the pump, losing money during the dump.

I can't say I agree with your conclusion re holding, whales don't care if you buy, sell or hold in the immediate aftermath of a pump, but it's nice to see a thread actually explaining the basic premise to people gain traction.

I'd note that if anything the instigators of this are likely still selling their DOGE, they're also likely behind all the alt accounts spamming memes and ""HODL"" nonsense. It's in their best interests to try and dump as much as of their DOGE as possible whilst the price is inflated.

I don't think anybody is going to be buying up DOGE at \~90 sats on the off chance that they might be able to instigate another pump and dump, although I don't doubt they are behind the rumours of a pump and dump tomorrow as an attempt to keep prices up now.",SimiKusoni,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lbi8h9/the_doge_pump_heres_what_happened_and_whats_next/,The DOGE Pump - Here's what Happened... and Whats Next.

I can remember as a younger kid listening to my neighbor tell me about this new thing called bitcoin, and how he and his friends thought it was the next big thing. I was too worried about the new call of duty at the time so I didn't listen. I don't have contact with him anymore, but i do recall the figures those days being sub $400.. hope he held.   


Point is, for a relatively small investment in this coin, you could potentially see a massive return. That is enticing enough for me, but I would tell everyone else who is interested - make sure whatever money you put in it, you would be ready to lose in a worst case scenario.

7064,2021-02-03 14:02:18,"I think your analysis of what happened is very sound.  About the future, somewhat less so, just because if marketcap is shaved off of some of the bigger coins, DOGE has a lot of competition.  Consider this in terms of stepwise motion: for DOGE to reach $1, every cent represents a step up of $1.28 billion in its marketcap.  It is VERY IMPRESSIVE that DOGE made that kind of transition to get to where it is, but, there are small coins with more known utility for which each of those stair steps represents a 10X, period.  

This is not to say that Doge cannot achieve all of its stair steps to $1, given long enough -- in a bull run of 12-18 months, it is certainly not impossible.  We have established that several million of us like the coin, so there is a base, BUT, DOGE has to find a way to beat out very serious competitors in order to capture the equivalent of $8-11 billion in marketcap a month.  Make it even two years: to get to $1, DOGE still has to find about $530 million in marketcap a month because the developers are refusing to cap the supply.  In the interim, some strong case has to be made about why DOGE should be the beneficiary of other coins not doing as well, in the midst of competitors whose marketcaps can do higher multiples with the same amount of money.",General_Awareness535,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lbi8h9/the_doge_pump_heres_what_happened_and_whats_next/,The DOGE Pump - Here's what Happened... and Whats Next.
7065,2021-02-03 14:48:07,"Clearly with the crash of last week, people won't invest in it. As for the pump, you are right, it was a slow pump, that is now and forever over, now it is a slow dump, hence the price going down, and down, and down. 

Problem is like the XRP, people expect the 'big pump' to happen, where actually it has happened, and it is happening right now. People buy Doge at inflated prices, like the bought XRP at inflated prices, and the people behind it cash in massive, huge profits. In some months when Doge is at 0.01 people will ask ? Where is the big pump? Reply, same as XRP, well, it WAS the big pump and dump, sorry guys.

They still have a couple hundred millions Doge lying around, so they don't want to get more of it.

7147,2021-03-17 11:25:25,"Yeah, it's a meme coin, but it's not here for the quick PnD like most. It's goal is to get some staying power like DOGE. That's why they're in the process of being Certik certified right now:

 [CertiK Security Leaderboard - Hoge Finance](https://certik.org/projects/hogefinance) 

This is huge, as it opens the door to Binance and other major exchanges. They've already passed an audit, but Certik is the real deal. The whales who were in it for a quick buck have already dumped and the price is super low now. This is the perfect time to go all in on a budget-priced alt that's going to explode once it gets the Certik seal and becomes easier for the masses to buy.

There's a reason this is the meme coin all others are compared to. HOGE has a higher security rating on Certik than Tether. It's starting to be accepted for payment along with BTC, ETH, and DOGE by vendors who don't accept any other alts:

7161,2021-04-21 19:04:11,"You should be more open-minded. I have a hard time taking people seriously who call Dogecoin garbage. Merge mined with LTC, so very secure. Fair launch (no premine or ICO). Powerful branding. Legacy coin - been around for a long time. Let’s address the criticism. Read what the Monero people write about trailing emissions with no hard cap. Now I like Litecoin even more in this regard because it gets to benefit from Doge’s inflation while having a hard cap itself. Founder called it a joke, but I mean it’s decentralized so who cares. It speaks to Doge’s maturity that the founder is irrelevant. Lack of development - okay well what do you want? It’s a simple payment system and it works fine. Upgrades that have been applied to Bitcoin and Litecoin would be pretty easy to implement if Doge needs to scale. Concentration of wealth, yes it definitely has a problem there, and that’s personally why I don’t have any, but I wouldn’t call it garbage on that one count. And that will go away with time too. Not without pain as whales sell off, but it will go away

7197,2020-08-23 04:40:20,"I'm just gonna share a little bit of my experience in trying to guess a bottom. And how you can be easily fooled, and it's never as obvious as it seems.

Some of you may not remember the last alt-coin craze back in 2017 through early 2018. But I jumped on several alt-coin bandwagons back then. Got burned by most of them. But I'll talk more about Nano (back then Raiblocks), since it's a more popular topic here.

Raiblocks (XRB) was a brand new exciting project in its baby stage. Back then alt-coins were much more treated like they could be potential replacement for Bitcoin or ""the next Bitcoin"". XRB started to generate a lot of buzz when it entered the top 20 market cap the first month of 2018, when it skyrocketed to $37. Everyone started to talk about it, it was all over the crypto youtube community.

And in a matter of weeks it crashed to what seemed to be $4.70 bottom. I saw XRB at around $5 and jumped on what seemed like a golden opportunity to buy the bottom of a new promising coin, that was only starting to pop up on exchanges. Had a lot of reasons to go up.

Keep in mind this was around the same time Bitcoin looked like it had hit rock bottom at $6K, and was beginning to go back up. So without your 20/20 hindesight, you can maybe understand why it would look like a great time to buy.

But as we all know now, it dropped further into eventually $0.35.

I mentioned XRB, but the same story was true for almost all alt-coins you would have bought at that time. I'm telling you guys that now, because I see a lot of people struggling to guess some more bottoms. Back then there seemed to be no logic and reason behind believing that XRB would go to 35 cents, when it was already 70 cents when it got first introduced to the first exchanges.",fan_of_hakiksexydays,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ie8hi8/daily_discussion_august_22_2020_gmt0/,"Daily Discussion - August 22, 2020 (GMT+0)"

Calling it a shitcoin etc.. Well sorry but ICX is here to stay and the crypto community should be happy to see some mainstream blockchain adoption. Whilst some partners will indeed use their private chains, the Jeju island news shows that the public chain will get a minimum of 15m transactions per year from visitors. This is government endorsed so it will only trigger more and more adoption (other Korean provinces, different use case than COVID tracking etc..). The private sector will also be more willing to jump in as a result. The Icon team has been building for the past 2 years and was quiet about it. For sure the 2017 run led the coin to be overhyped and overvalued (so as every others) but I can’t understand why people would have to bitch so much about it? Don’t blame others for your poor investment choices and take a step back to look at the broader picture. VET, ICX, VIDt being used by actual companies are good for the whole ecosystem. These coins are thriving and if you can’t understand why then you may need to reconsider investing in crypto.

7364,2021-04-03 07:08:12,"If you have a plan, stick to it. This sub rarely discusses price action so it’s probably not the best place to seek discussion on that.

That said, a few counter points as food for thought:

1.	I find it unlikely that the market will react strongly even if Tether announces its reserve is 90% crypto. They have pretty much already disclose that in their latest attestation (backed by digital tokens, loans, and unbacked XAUT), and the NYAG also proved that they were repeatedly lying and was insolvent at least at some time, yet the market had no reaction at all. All it takes is some spin (“Tether increases transparency, release proof they are fully backed”) and the market will just accept it.
2.	There’s unlikely to be external intervention on Tether in short term. NYAG has done what they can within their power and jurisdiction, and at this point only DoJ or FBI could potentially touch them. So, the Tether pump will continue which will support the price.
3.	All the big players (exchanges, HODLers, whales, etc.) has no incentive to push down the price. Instead, they want to keep the price high so they could leverage against that price by taking loans, using the crypto as collateral, etc. 
4.	The macroeconomic environment continue to be loose, with lots of USD liquidity seeking profit. That won’t change unless the FED tightens their QE. Until that happens, even if the price drops, it’s likely to be temporary.
5.	The classic “the market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent”. 
6.	Historically, Bitcoin’s bubble had been bigger. So far, it’s “only” up 15x, while the 2017 bubble was ~20x. Of course, the higher the price, the more money inflow it takes to pump the same %, but the Tether printer counteracts that.

Ultimately, no one can predict the price action, or we’d all be rich. I’m just wondering what’s your reasoning, as why do you think the price will drop here. Bearish narrative that I can construct from here is...

1.	BTC price has been sideways despite huge amount of Tether printing, for weeks. It’s been almost 10B since it first touched 60k, yet it’s staying under it.
2.	Alts are pumping - which usually happens after a BTC (local) top. However, there’s no way to tell if this is the local top or the macro top.",Rainarrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mis1w7/rug_pull_april/,Rug pull April

We all believe there will be a massive sell off, but timing it is gambling. There's no easy way to tell what irrational people are going to do.  I thought for sure the NYAG mess would have had more of an impact, but I underestimated the gall and cognitive dissonance in the industry.

Here's another thing you've underestimated: even if you're right with the timing, the idea that the exchanges will honor your short positions is laughable.  This isn't regulated exchanges.

And you, you're basically not any better than any of them.  You're a degenerate gambler too, just playing the other side.  I hope you lose your ass more than the people who are on the other side.  You're pretending you're better, but you're not.

7396,2021-01-11 12:12:13,"And now we’re at the phase where everyone is trying to convince others to hold instead of taking profit to disguise how they’re internally freaking out and somehow they’ve “figured it all out”.

This person doesn’t know anything, just like you or I don’t know anything. The people at the very top haven’t really figured out how this market reacts because it’s so volatile. Now this person also likes to hide behind the snarky veneer of “I know better” with his “remind me in 1 month” comments, but in the end the fundamentals of all markets are simple:

Bull runs are ALWAYS met with corrections. Bull runs like this also tend to have very strong corrections because it’s a bubble. Now this may not be “it”, but it’s coming.

If the markets crash, OP will disappear until a few years down the line and if it hits 100k, they’ll come back so they can say “I told you so”. I saw this EXACT same bullshit mentality in 2017-18 and it’s extremely careless. It’s reckless behaviour that can cause a lot of financial damage.

Yes holding for another 5 years might get you 100k, but if you take out that 5-10k that you have now, you’ll be protected if shit goes south in your life. Now ask yourself, are you prepared to lose it all? If not, you might really fucking wish you took profit then. You can always reinvest some of your cash into safer assets, with safer returns and then dip back into crypto. You also don’t have to withdraw all of your crypto, just enough for a safety net.

Seriously, can you handle the mental strain of watching $10k dwindle down to $5000, $2000, or maybe even $100? It’s a question you should really be asking yourself and a question only you know the answer to.

Yes, I’m actually talking from experience and I’ve been through this. Life can also be fucking brutal, as we all found out last year.

Be smart. Don’t repeat past mistakes. Don’t just take the word of anyone, even me, because in the end, whether you hold or decide to take profit, it’s all up to you. Don’t listen to random redditors about YOUR MONEY. Don’t let ANYONE influence that decision because the consequences will be YOURS AND YOURS ALONE!

You’re not all “in this together”, because the moment shit hits the fan everyone disappears and I doubt OP or anyone on this sub would give you a leg up if shit crashed and burned and you needed help.

The most you’ll get from the “experts” here is a link to the suicide hotline pinned and I’m not even joking here, it’s happened before... but that’s probably a great time to buy, and as sad as this statement is, it’s probably true.

7437,2021-01-11 23:23:25,"Hold On, Don’t Sell and one day you will reach a level where a 30% drop means nothing as the fact stands, having left this investment in a savings account will cost you. Your money will loose value and right now, earn a 0.1% interest rate. When you fall below a certain level, that 15.00 a month just holding an account. I started small, and I used to panic sell. I paid fortunes in exchange fees. Then I figured out a few things. 

1. I’m an investor, not a day trader. I believe this is part of the future. 

2. I don’t put all my eggs in one basket. 

3. I put aside money I need to pay my bills. 

4. I don’t by shit I don’t need. 

5. The crypto I buy, must support real world uses, the exception is Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin is the grand daddy and has intrinsic, marketing and is decentralized. I believe in other a lock chains that do real work, Ethereum, Polkadot, EnergyWeb examples. They mist have a purpose, backed by big corporations, used to solve problems. I follow the developers, ones with reputations like Gavin Wood of Polkadot and Vitalik Buterin a Co Founder of Ethereum. I don’t try being the latest shitcoins looking for 100x returns, they are called Shitcoins for a reason. Follow the big corporate, hedge funds, millionaire investors. I follow a few Youtube Channels, personally I like Alt Coin Daily, and Tyler no matter what a stoner he is on Chico Crypto, because these guys don’t ask for you to sign up for secret news letters. They also both do a lot of good research and are good at connecting the dots. 

6. I do my own dedicated research, I keep on top of things. I spend time reading, researching and when I hear something that makes sense, I follow up on my own. I dig down into the weeds, reading SEC, Treasury Department Releases, public documents open to the public. I break my ass learning. A portion of my net wealth is crypto, but I, not all in, things all have a balance. 

7. I pay my taxes. I keep in mind that if Bitcoin drops 30%, and I’ve held it less than a year, I am taxed in the United States as earned income. This can be as high as 37%, where holdings that have remained Bitcoin longer than a year are a Capitol gain of 10 - 15 percent, so how does that help day trading the dips and drops, especially big ones unless it’s old coin. It’s a nightmare keeping track of all my buys and sells day trading in this country, your requirements may very. I pay my taxes because the US internal revenue knows I hold crypto, and at what addresses. Why do I know this, because it’s not hard to follow. When an exchange takes money from a bank account, Visa card, they know American Citizens bought crypto. They also are given the amounts, trades and dates, they know the pseudo anonymous Bitcoin address the exchange sends the coins. If I transfer to an exchange, I had to buy it from somewhere. Using technology they now possess, following Bitcoin from one wallet to the next, takes seconds. The public blockchain is available to anyone. I don’t want to pay fines up to 25%, go through a nickel and dime audit and the pain. 

8, I use a hardware wallet. I changed from a soft wallet as soon as what I’d held was more than the cost of loosing everything crossed. The cost associated 50.00 - 120.00 USD makes sense. I hear all these people pissed off at ledger, for leaking their private info, I get it. The hardware wallet is still secure. They didn’t leak the data, their 3rd party  customer manager did. They don’t know my seed, or hold my keys. I got hit by a breach of Equifax a few years back and they lost all my private information, if you have a credit card, they have your info. That sucked. If your online, dealing with large sums of money, get a P.O. Box, a virtual number and don’t trust any emails, text messages, anything. Stealing money from those who trust but don’t verify is as old as prostitution. 

9. Have an exit plan and expect to hold as long as you can, 3, 5, 7, 10 years. When you profit, take some old money off the table ad put it into something with less risk, I don’t know pasta for all I care. Just take some profits. Get back the initial investment and then it’s money you never had in the first place. How much, it’s up to you. 

I’m not selling a services for anyone. I’m not connected to any mentioned companies. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just telling you, the New investor how I do this, and ask nothing from you. Crypto will be here to stay, it’s still risk vs reward and the reward is great, but the risk is high. I get in this game because I don’t want to end up being mediocre because I didn’t try, and made informed decisions. Remember, you have lost nothing until you sell.

In backing the OP and his points, true, I believe him for most of his points. Example, a friend who wanted help buying crypto asked me to walk them through and exchange purchase of Bitcoin last week. Once the order was accepted, it took a very long time for it to find sellers and required an amazing number of small purchases over a long period of time. There is a shortage of Bitcoin and the only way to free it up is shake out those who put in more than they could afford to loose, or were way over leveraged. It made a killing for the over leveraged longs, and gave a little back to those shorting the market who got killed in the moonshot.

7457,2021-01-12 00:23:29,"I don’t think this dip is from institutions trying to buy more BTC. We’ve ran from 11k up to 40k in the past 90 days and were bound for a correction. A lot of this run up is from institutional buying but a lot of this dip is literally because the cost of BTC is so much higher, when you market sell, price has a lot more room to go down. BTC is still a volatile asset and just bc it’s market cap goes up doesn’t mean that it has enough liquidity for it to drop less. A higher BTC number just means that volatility is higher and can be more damaging for anyone on a leveraged trade. If we look at all BTC trading volume and compare spot to derivatives, there’s a lot of price action being propped up by leverage traders. This isn’t sustainable and actually in the short term and hurts late longers when they get stopped out/liquidated because when price is so high and swings so hard, liquidations get easier because we’re so high up the ladder. 

Also another thing is there are still whales with a lot of BTC that don’t know how to efficiently sell of their reserves. Market selling BTC with HIGH slippage still happens all the time and factors like this bring down the price short term.",LuxCreative,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kuvpyk/this_isnt_a_dip_its_a_giant_liquidity_suck/,"This isn't a ""dip.""

I do think we're still in an overall bull run though.  If BTC *only* did a 2x of it's past ATH, that would be the worst ATH beating in the history of the coin.  The worst by a long shot. We usually see 5-10x when you look back months/years later and see where a run peaked.

7601,2021-02-03 01:42:44,"Buy BTC and ethereum as value store, look for dips in price to buy do some research. Use limit sell orders to buy or take profits. Doge IMO is one of the worst coins to invest in because its inflationary and heavily controlled. However it's got meme power so who knows where it will go. I think it's risky. You can either cut your losses or hold out for another pump which very well maybe happen (especially after GME is over).

XRP has potential, if you look up the lawsuit wrapped around XRP right now you can see why some wanted to dump their wallet. Is it worth 0.5? it seems to have support around there. You have the option to break even on it and pull your dollar back. However I encourage you to read up about what XRP actually is and see what's good about it. I'm holding XRP personally but it's a somewhat small portion of my portfolio (4%).

I have a pretty positive view of chainlink right now. I like the coin and I think the platform it's built on shows serious potential, I think a technical anaylsis on the coin pricing chart looks really healthy and it's at a dip. I would not at all be surprised if LINK was in the high 30s or even nudging low 40s in about a week. However ETH has an extremely positive outlook and is on the verge of breaking out and BTC is gonna go huge this year I believe.

**I'm not suggesting you do this, this is merely my strategy**:

\-Research coins, look a price history, try to identify trends; Keep a 40% portfolio stake in BTC and ETH, these are weighted against each versus which one is doing better (however I'm weighted on BTC and it's at a dip so I'm just holding for now)

\-Identify lows in trends and weight portfolio according to those trends and try to buy the perceived dips or coins with bullish patterns

\-The more bullish a coin pattern, the heavier the portfolio weight.

\-Once coin begins to spike out of trend lines, shows volatility, or whatever else. I set up progressive sell orders and I sell a small amount of currency to ride the increase since I can't watch a chart all day.

\-Once the sell off has come back to fiat, I look at all the charts again and repeat the process, so far it's working alright but I'm sure there's better methods out there.

&#x200B;

I'll explain how I gained off XRP. I noted some increasing volatility, I did my analysis and identified that it was a bullish pattern on saturday. I didn't know where it was headed and had to sleep so I set up my sale orders. Say I bought 70 XRP at 0.48 ($33.6 CAD) (It was something like this but the coin values are adjusted for simplicity)

I put in sell orders at: $0.52, $0.62. $0.75, $0.82, $0.92, $0.95, $0.99 and left them

By Monday I sold all orders except for $0.99, so my average sale price came out to 0.763, or $38.17CAD with 10 XRP remaining, or $4.6 CAD at the time of writing this post; so I walk away with $42.77. That means I got about a 28% increase in CAD from that pump. I could have made more, sure, but I like to just set it and forget it to some degree. Especially over night.

You were caught in the Pump and Dump scheme, I personally would not keep both coins and cut your loss and reinvest that money into BTC or ETH (before they loose even more value when people will stop to try and pump it). 

Doge is more a meme coin and the total of coin available is infinite and will never go where people say it will (from my understanding).

So my advice for you is, if you want to invest in something else than BTC and ETH do some research on the project you think you believe in.

And one last thing, don't believe 99% of what youtuber say, they are most likely only pumping other coins to their advantage and no one will ever know what is the future of a crypto, in the end it will either go up or down ;) Also never disclose the amount you have invested, it will attract bad people to try to scam you or something.

One key date already passed on the 29/01 and there are a few coming up that are key in Feb, what remains to be seen is after this week, what is the short float position, because as of this time last week it was close to 1.5x the amount of shares on issue to the market which is where the craziness turned into an apocalypse scenario.

If between Tuesday and Friday, with the freezing by the brokers and an obvious short laddering  play by the funds, they've managed to reduce that float then there is far less pain that Wallstreet is going to feel and unfortunately the ""revolution"" will run out of steam.

7669,2020-12-27 21:13:29,"The general understanding of Bitcoin from these big money proselytes is embarrassing in my opinion.

It’s bizarre at this juncture to observe masses of people blindly believing Bitcoin to be this perfectly made thing that can solve any and all problems frictionlessly when they present themselves. 

The majority of all people I hear talk about Bitcoin still think it is anonymous, or in the case of those with a slightly better comprehension, think that privacy, fungibility, etc., can be implemented at the drop of a hat. We all know that’s bollocks.

Watching Bitcoin zealots at this point is like watching a drunk person slur talk with childlike glee over a dubious business venture, when you’re sober or in the least still got control of your faculties, it’s a tiresome and at its extreme, alarming.

Monero is available for those who want to use and appreciate it and that is just what I’ll do until proven otherwise.

Give zero regard for the hype cycles or the doom sessions on forums, they’re useless. 

Independence can be and will be isolating, but just remember:

Guess who's gonna get left in the dust, when all the other coins like ETH will pump (just take a look at the ETH rebounce in ratio today). 

Monero is dumped when bitcoin pumps and is dumped when top-alts pump and is dumped when bitcoin/top-alts dump. Basically is dumped all the time except some random days between all the other market moves. I know market moves are chaotic and complex, but for other coins there is some kind of pattern there. What is the pattern here? I don't get it.

I'm sure there will be a big altcoin move soon, but take it for granted Monero will not take part in this.

I understand more dogecoins are created/released each year to combat deflation and lack of availability.  However, is this done off of a percentage of current circulated coins?  Is this done as a constant each year?  Is the goal to have X amount amount of dogecoins in circulation? Or is the goal simply to ADD X amount of dogecoins each year?

Hopefully what I'm asking makes sense.  I can't understand how any asset is meant to hold it's value over time if it's designed to increase at a constant.  If it's designed simply to make sure X number of coins are always in circulation however, then I understand the potential value.",Jacobraker588,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lbi4p7/the_doge_pump_a_breakdown_of_what_went_down_and/,The DOGE Pump - A Breakdown of What Went Down... and What is Next for DOGE!

7757,2021-03-30 12:59:20,"I hold ETH and want it to do well, but the economist in me is wondering, if ETH is “scarce like gold” and also needs to be used for dapps, hence like building a road of gold.... is that not the equivalent of taxing the dapps heavily? It seems to me that high gas fees hurt the dapps, which makes the concept of this decentralized internet too expensive to be practical if the roads of gold analogy is accurate.  I’m just trying to logically follow through what you are saying.  We better all hope that the dapps are so great that people will continue to pay us with scarcity by burning their super high value ETH. That’s a complicated tug-of-war right there.  I don’t know where it will balance out, but if the network of dapps that backs ETH are too expensive, is that really a benefit in the long term?  Should the aim of ether not be to house the most efficient decentralized internet, not the most taxed? How far can the dapps be squeezed?
