152,"Bull!ish movement over the last 24 hours helped Neo recapture the region above the $96-resistance, while support at $87.54 acted as a base for some buying. Even though the market reflected some bullish sentiment, a stronger test awaited the bulls at the $102.15-resistance. A successful recapture of this area would allow for sharper gains in the Neo market, but a hike towards the local top of $133.9 still seemed distant. The Awesome Oscillator was slightly bullish as the pr!ce approached the $102.15-level, but the last session of trade did switch. The ADX Indicator clocked in at 13 and suggested that more strength was needed before a breakout above its immediate upper ceiling. In the crypto world of investment, with the right tools and tradlng sign@l provided by a professional tr@der such as Sir Steve Keen, tradlng crypt0 will be very easy for any investor both new and old. I have been into crypt0 assets investment over the years using the str@tegy and slgnaI services he provides. He is also a finance journalist and an expert tra:der that has several of his free courses about tradlng on the web and it is very helpful as a tr@der. He can be reached on Te=le=gr=am (@Keensignals) for strictly crypt0 related investments."

I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Koen Albers whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now, netting in more than 9 btc in profit already. Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Koen.  He can be reached on whatsAap (+44 7828 450768) and telrgram (+447828 450768) .

803,"WHAT IS BITCOIN !!!

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[ Nakamoto's identity remains unknown..

I’m not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 17BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s!gnals from Gavin of cyberhackinggenius. He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market , stack up more bitcoin and he also helped recover my stolen Bitcoin plus an active private key. You make 50% profit as return on investment for every amount invested in exactly 24 hours. He can be reached via gmail (cyberhackinggenius) and What's-- application (+19256795146) for his assistance. Lets be positive and remain winning."

1101,"For most investors who entered late last year, the recent historical highs were extremely attractive profit-taking targets. It is the consequences of such profit-taking decisions that we are now witnessing in the crypto market. There is no trend reversal because there is no panic selling. Active asset purchases immediately after the plunge below $30K indicates the preservation of the pool of investors who are still willing to believe in the continued upward BTC dynamics. Market participants are still undecided about the relationship between Bitcoin and the traditional market. On the one hand, the asset has become part of it, as buying by traditional funds ramp up. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the decentralized digital code will ever fit into the market framework, which began working long before the advent of the Internet and computers in general. Investors are looking to make a bullish move so as to earn from hoarding, while traders are earning from price movements. Trading has always been a more profitable means of earning, this has been a major step for me, I have found a crypto guide in Burwell Coleman and his signals are top notch. I must say, I haven’t seen any service as his, I made over 12 BTC within 4 weeks, and this was done solely from my daily trade sessions on my live trading account, trading from my experience is the most lucrative opportunity crypto offers yet, every crypto trader should learn the art and utilize its gains. Burwell Coleman can be reached on gmail at (burwellcolemanfinance@gmailcom) and teleqram (burwellcoleman) . Buy the dip!"

1392,"Have you been scammed by a website, have late payments due, lost payments, and so on? There is a very good chance CRYPTORECOVERYX can recover this money for you. CRYPTORECOVERYX refers to the task of recovery of assets that have been wrongfully taken either stolen, fraudulently misappropriated or otherwise disposed of to remove them from their rightful owner. CRYPTORECOVERYX has three main elements—identification, redeployment, and divestment.

What they need from you:

The company name and web address, as well as any other information you can provide about the company.

Any information that identifies you as an account owner. Email address, phone number, home address, and any other person information used during sign up, as well as your username and complete name used to sign up for the service. If you have an account number or membership number this is needed as well. All emails you have received from this company in any regard, shape, or manner. The total amount owed to you, along with any proof of such. Invoices, screen shots, emailed admissions from them with promises to pay and so on. Proof of what they owe you is of extreme importance, BUT this does NOT mean they still cannot recover your money for you even with lack of proof. You may not have these records...they do!

They will do a complete investigation on the company. Background check, company status (if they are a licensed company), as well as financial paper work filed with their local agencies. Once they have evidence exposing them as a scam or fraud involved in illegal activity, they will contact them on your behalf. They will discuss your case with them, while also pointing out proof of illegal activity. Once they know they have them, it is usually enough to recover your funds fairly quickly. Here is their email address: CRYPTORECOVERYX @ CONSULTANT. COM"

1414,"Investment scam is all over the place in recent times and due to greediness people fall victim daily to bogus promises. May i tell you that  out of 100% of people or companies advertising investment, just like 2% can guarantee the outcome. The rest are mere scorn artists who just want to take your money. Thread with caution!

This is also a signal to all regulatory authorities to buckle up. You must know that if cryptocurrency is prohibited in your jurisdiction you do not have business with it. The reason being that when there is a problem or abuse, the investor lacks government protection.

If you sense that you are being defrauded by an investment company there are few steps listed below which could help you to recover them if you have all your proof of investment and conversation history. The following are the process:

Firstly, if cryptocurrency is regulated in your jurisdiction like in the United States, File your complaint with the SEC. Why file with the SEC? Some of these companies are registered and it is the duty of the SEC to regulate them. Filing will make the SEC investigate and bring down the company. This is usually not the case as we have experienced in our quest to recover money for victims of fraud. Virtually all the companies are unregistered and are usually operated by fake individuals with fake identities. So reporting to the SEC may not really do justice.

File a report with any Law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction, like the FBI in the US. The essence of this is for investigation but this usually is not an easy one since most of them operate with fake identities and FBI’s investigation is usually very slow. Making it that before the investigations concluded the scorn would have emptied the wallet.

The next is that if the amount lost is what you can bear, please bear it and invest no more.

The last option is that you should try using virtual asset recovery companies. However, i must strongly advise you to thread with caution because most of these investment companies now pose to be recovery companies and they are out there to steal from you. This is owing to our experience in the recovery industry.

Some people have been defrauded twice because they went to the wrong place to seek help. Do not be desperate. When you send your complaint to contact@activebonorum.com the firm will review your claim to ensure that you really invested with these companies and if the same turns out to be successful, the firm would proceed from there.

Finally, I must advise you to inform www.activebonorum.com you that you have been defrauded due to the trauma that comes with this. Also, inform your therapist if need be."

As we all know the world is evolved already and crypto currency is on a speedy rise regardless. I attended a business submit months back held by Mrs Anabelle in the United Kingdom. I never had any knowledge about how it is being done, until Expert Mrs Anabelle gave some speeches and broke each stage in details. I was able to learn strongly underperformed bitcoin processes during BTC's move to $18, 000... In fact the most recent rise from $13,000 to $18,850. I decided to invest with $5,000 and in interval of 14 days business trading with Expert Anabelle I was able to earn a benefiting profit of $19,820.

They lied to me that he has processed my money and that it's on its way to my account but it is now 3 days after without any money.

1658,"Well I will also say this here... Talking from my own experience as a cryptocurrency trader mostly BITCOIN TRADING as the leading asset, so far I have come to realize that the crypto market is of two sides. As some people will hold and wait for bitcoin to skyrocket so they can sell-off, while others will wait for bitcoin to fall so they can buy at a cheaper rate. However, I see all this worries baseless if they can't yield good profits, my advice still stands on involving in day trading by finding an accurate strategy/daily signals in other to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio. For me, it's been so successful for over 7 months because I was smart enough to find working daily signals which are being provided by a pro trader known as Mr. James Carlson during the first 2 weeks I accumulated and grew my portfolio from 2btc to a total of 8.4btc which you will agree is a very good profit, James can be reach on Telegram (@ JamesC51 ) and whatsapp +447476717980 for more profitable system."

1769,"It now appears that Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have been able to gain the upper hand over bears in the time following the intense volatility that the asset incurred early this week during its sudden “flash crash” that caught investors off guard. Because BTC is now slowly climbing back up towards the coveted five-figure price region, it does appear that it is shaping up to once again see a sharp upward movement that leads it past the resistance it faces at $10,000. In the near-term, analysts believe that the crypto’s defense of key support may be a bullish sign, leading one top trader to anticipate the ongoing BTC uptrend to continue strong in the near-term.

1784,"It is very safe to say that many people have lost their Bitcoins. The real question is whether the Bitcoins are lost for good or not? As the price of Bitcoin continues to rush forward and its demand for cracking forgotten passwords increases, services have come up to assist people in recovering their Bitcoin wallets. However, these options are limited. There are also a number of tutorials to recover bitcoins in cases of technical difficulties. Get in touch with MICHAEL @ BTC-RECOVERY .COM to recover your lost funds to binary options and fake hackers. “Presumably the rate of losing coins will go down because people are very much careful about how they are stored,” says Schvey. “People are investing so much money into mining Bitcoin, they’ll take proper practices.” He adds."

1836,"I think it was before BIP 38. Thanks to BIP 38 we can but memorize 24 English words and that's enough to store several bitcoin wallets, as well as ark, litecoin, ethereum. Now as I have memorized my passphrase, I could not throw it out even if I wanted to; I can merely throw out the paper version of it. Storing bitcoin on a hard drive used to involve storing tens of gigabytes of data (and growing by ~10 GB per year). The cost of storing bitcoin could be then higher than the value of 7000 bitcoin. (Unless he chose to extract the key to store it on a floppy disk and later download the bitcoin history from scratch). I wonder if he still has his address (public key), though. He could then check whether somebody else has found the hard drive."

2578,btw cellframe has a presale on trustswap. trustswap tokens are now cheaper then ever. down to 3 from 4usd. You need to stake 4000 or 2500 SWAPS for 2 months in order to participate in presales. But it's well worthwhile. I have a swapscore of 4000 which gives me a 1k USD allocation for presales. So far many of the presales have gone up 10x to 20x. The worst did 2x. So I got my money back many times by now. It's all true. Check it for yourself. Gonna get 500 cellframes for 0.1$ I hope. Just saying this for some good karma.

I think it's healthy for people to take profit.. what's the point on buying everything that you can NEVER EVER sell? that makes no sense... HOLD for sure but, if you need to take profit than take it... there are coins/tokens that are not meant to be hold for long term unless you like the project and support whatever it is that you searched. I have a few that is short term and some are long term holds, EVERYONE works like that.! anyhow, thank you for the information"

3197,You need some intro music before the intro quote if you're gonna keep doing it. Its weird being silent and seeing all that mashup for 10 seconds.
3198,Don't buy crypto on PayPal. They put a mandatory 5-21 day hold on all withdrawals.
3199,"I was literally about to fall asleep then the notification hit, i guess no sleep for me."

3235,"Elon buying is bullish Elon selling is bullish, bro wtf is there a time where it’s not bullish why is it that only during the bull runs we see these videos and then the video makers spread FOMO"
3236,"Elon musk just clarify he is not selling any of his bitcoin, cek twitter 👍"
3237,Why announce it?
3238,"Well it might be bullish. But to an extent it is also bullshit after everything he said only a few weeks ago. I wish I had his money, I would be buying this dip till all I had left was my underpants and my BTC."
3239,Elon has paper hand :)) laugh at that

3321,"idk, if you look at the 4h the wyckoff dump already happened.."
3322,We're definitely hitting $45k and probably deeper.

3326,"Kirby mate IV been watching your video for 2 years and I love your commentary most,funny guy lil James and the water cooler 😂😂🤣🤣🤣legend !"
3327,there is absolutely no way that 65K is the top for bitcoin on this bull run.
3328,Thanks for that info on the alt market... a correction has to be coming at some point...
3329,"Back in 2017, there was no institutional money or much less than now. Having said that, retail interests could be less this time round because the high price. New comers prefer to buy cheap altcoins than bitcoins even though they could buy a fraction of the latter. Just psychologically not as appealing..."
3331,"+1 Subs :D 
i like the comedi in the video :P"
3332,"Good analysis, we always need to consider all possibilities"
3333,What software is that?
3334,Thanks Kirb
3335,We appreciate you showing the possibility of going down.
3336,ETH?
3337,I absolutely agree the blow off top will be in Alts. Yes last run we had to buy Alts with btc. Looking forward to the next few weeks.🍿☕️
3338,Crypto is Chutes and Ladders for big people with lots of cuss words😁
3339,Degenerates

3341,"The  most money is made in altcoins in this bullrun so yes , blow of top could be in alt too🤷🏼‍♂️"
3342,0:40 sec in and im already love this video!
3343,Thanks for always keeping it real with us Megaladon 😊👍🏽
3344,"You're absolutly right, the new persons coming on the market are buying from fiat or USDT, they don't need to pass by the BTC. For them it's not the same dynamic, it's maybe still the dynamic for the persons who have their economy in BTC and who have known the end of the precedent bull market. It's sure it will be different, but how much because there's still a certain inertia."
3345,I've been here since before the dump down from 6k 2018. Getting this crypto. You are the man Kirbs.
3346,Great analysis
3347,"We could have another possible bullish catalyst coming up in the next few months—an approval of a bitcoin ETF. But, this could be just another opportunity for whales to “distribute” on the masses."
3348,Great comparison with the Wyckoff. Good work! You're amazing.
3349,Thank you for answering my question before I could even articulate it!
3350,Another drama
3351,dropping knowledge like a fiend kirbs  i've been feeling that same thing
3352,"Didnt notice u hit 100k subs, wow congrats kirbs.. ive been here since u were 30k bro. lets get this crypto!"
3353,Thank you for sharing your perspective and knowledge. I appreciate every video very much sir. Sheesh you're awesome bro.
3354,Love your out of the box thinking 🙏🏿
3355,"We appreciate your TA, Kirb!"
3356,First time I have heard the argument on BTC pairs driving a new market cycle. Makes very good sense. Smart man Kirby!
3358,When the stock market crashes hard which it will. Bitcoins going down with the ship as well. That’s the time to buy buy buy!!!
3359,Can't wait if it goes down. That way I can buy more
3360,I hope dump i will buyy All in
3361,Im from indonesian..agreed.
3362,"Watching this, I'm now wondering if I have enough gold and silver.😆"
3363,ETH is leading the market right now and I expect it to continue until it BTC hits 39% market capitalization just like we did in June 2017
3364,"If the Bull mkt ends here it would be an anomaly. More probably needs a pullback. Just look at the extension from the 20 and 55 mas... But hey, everything is possible."
3365,"Time will tell. I think the next few weeks, end of April to early May, are very crucial."
3366,"Love it, Kirby!. Just 2 days ago I was discussing that same possibility of the altcoins/BTC pairs for this BTC ATH that you are mentioning... I don't feel so ""alone"" on my thoughts now. And cheer up!!. We all want BTC up, but if it doesn't happen...well... this is what market do. Analisys like yours are very needed on this full of FOMO times.   There is one thing that makes this (our) well thought theory stumble a little... There's no doubt that Strong hands are buying between the 50k levels... They wouldn't ,if they wouldn't think it will report them benefits. As you say... we will see soon whats really going on :)  Cheers and congrats for your great analisys!!"
3367,Bitcoin is going down more money to be made in etherium Bitcoin goes down 20-35 percent
3368,Thanks Kirbz! Appreciate it..
3369,Looking very Whaleish 👀
3370,"god I hope your wrong. but solid points. but...I have been stacking 4yrs, not about to sell now, not smart enough to time the market"
3371,Could ya cover ETH for us on the next stream??
3372,3:35 same happened in 2017
3373,"BTC Dumped right after the Dons video.!! Data not emotion...buy low hodl—or-buy low sell high,get a grip if you wanna rip!!!"
3374,This guy! No way where going Down Kirby it's only going up up up lol ...
3375,Been here with you for years... The blow off top is definitely coming.. I'm thinking 70k area is where it happens..
3376,"I sure hope you’re wrong, yet must admit that it makes a hell lot of sense! For fogs’ sake!"
3377,New information I didn’t know they didn’t have many stable coins and Bitcoin was essentially the transitional currency into Altcoins. Well that will change my perspective!
3378,Is little jaaaaaames ready for all situations? Like a cobra striking out of the grass. It's the Don.
3379,I think that what will sustain the crypto environment is the ongoing innovation in blockchain technology and how it has attracted investors and businesses. This in turn necessitates the issuance of altcoins ..... and Bitcoin is the best instrument for the buying and selling of them.
3380,"Great point about BTC going into alts, that might mean we won’t see an alt run after BTC TOPS"
3381,"BTC will probably retrace to $43,800 before shooting up to make new ATH's. Nothing is written in stone, but that's how I see it."
3382,No matter what happens I’m hodling!!
3383,"It was my first time watching your vid, interesting view Kirby, although making the point that one would need to buy Btc to get the alt coins the point could be made that Btc has increased it's value purely on it's own without the help of alt coins. With institutional support, a weak dollar, Btc scarcity and adaptation increasing, I can only hope a major sell off is less likely."
3384,"extremely well put perspective,we need to explore alternative narratives,thanks!"
3385,Thank you for keeping it real.
3386,"But... But.. cUUUrbi...They said if I invest $1,200 fiat USD into Ethereum.... I’d be a miLLionAiiiR.   :|"
3387,"Agree, but the stock 2 flow has been spot on and that is showing we're not at the top yet."
3388,Interesting arguments! Will have to aee what happens
3389,Little James and his alt coin homies will hodl the line!!!
3390,That's a great theory. It kinda makes sense......
3391,Nope.... it's not time yet.  Keep buying more
3392,I like MANA just keeps growing
3393,"This is realistic, most channels pump coins."
3394,inverse head and shoulders forming
3395,Best vid of the day.
3396,actually great point on the btc pairs in 17 and now having tether and/or direct usd pair.
3397,Thats a really good point. And i was looking the same wyckoff Distribution. Im with my eyes more open than ever.
3398,The demand for bitcoin is huge also
3399,Damn Kirby! I like the way you think...
3400,Bitcoin is the feature investing in it now is the wesest thing to do now especially the current rise
3401,Inverse head and shoulders
3402,All very well calling a dump but need a time frame?!? When u think we gona dump then?
3403,"At least someone is trying to give it too people real instead of it's just a matter of time before we go to a million 
Thx for the other side of the coin 🪙"
3404,"Eth should reach its 1.68 , sticking with that Limit order,"
3405,Should I sell all my btc then?
3406,I do have a honest question if you read these. So if we don’t see a blow off top for bitcoin because of reasons you said in the video... I believe if that is true does this mean a large correction will not happen as well just thinking of the sling shot affect (way up way down then find the middle) I havnt thought of this theory before it does make sense....new sub here
3407,Awesome
3408,"I understand that pretty much alt coins follow Bitcoin, but I own ethereum and it hasn’t exactly paralleled BTC the last month or so. Is the new ATH this blow off top? I have exit and enter strategies but I’d like more opinions"

3415,We will get a second Bull in November— D Move
3416,Really interesting !
3417,Thanks kirby. Always appreciated
3418,fantastic analysis. I've been saying the same for weeks re: BTC pairs and profit taking into USDT/ETH/BNB these days. It's definitely a different environment but nobody wants to hear it and the greed is off the charts.

3427,Wow such great insight. Thank you
3428,Thanks for damaging my health with your analysis
3429,Very good point. If this is the top we gonna have one crazy yearly candle 😂.
3430,Interessting analysis!
3431,You are amazing
3432,"Altcoins is all about speculation, while BTC is rather a long term investment. HOLD"
3433,You're the only person that prevents FOMO.
3434,All the markets are past the Euphoria stage.. I’m seeing people asking why their stock IPOs aren’t mooning and companies stocks were rallying if they just mentioned crypto.. If that’s not Euphoric type behavior I don’t know what is.. The only way BTC keeps rallying is if there’s another stimulus...
3435,Give a TA on Eth !!
3436,"It sounds like you think the upside from current levels is minimal at best. Based on your info, seems like selling is the way to go for now"
3437,10X  THANKS !!!
3438,"Top analysis, 👍"
3439,Dump inbound for sure!
3440,"Man, this was a great upload. You really make me think. Great content as always!"
3441,Hey does that mean we may not see an alt coin blow off like previous runs?
3442,What does this mean for the alts? Have they pumped already?
3443,very interesting theory
3444,Waiting for contracts to expire 😁 Interesting to see the Pi cross support the pullback
3445,Very insightful

3455,Feels like we may see a lower low before new ATH's
3456,Oh nos
3457,"The pi cycle is only controversial because it has not been tested enough.  Of course, it's worth observing."
3458,Butt but butt Kirby you just don't believe in bitcorn

3475,His hair changed like the market
3476,"I think it should be a criminal offence to pump and dump and other naforious methods obtaining crypto at the expense of genuine taders.
How on other can the vast majority of society have confidence investing in crypto when it is so manipulated. 
Today #btc is hovering yet again been 55k - 60k but as the weekend approached you can garentee the price will fall sharply only for it next week to retrace to current level.
My last point the whales swindle millions of people out of profits for greed. Surely crypto was developed as alternative to the greed and corruption in the main stream financial institutions."
3477,Excellent vid. Thanks
3478,The whales in XLM just did this today. So I bought a bunch.
3479,Thank you. This was helpful education.
3480,"Yeah. Dimon calling the kettle black. He’s such a shameless thieving liar. Always running from his guilt, making him always more guilty. Just another reason to like BTC."
3481,Thank you Guy ur teary eyed
3482,"Talking about market manipulation, I believe one example is the XVG/BTC coin in Binance, where you see a normal behavior to the time frame of the 1D, 1W, 4H, but when you switch to the 1H, 15M time frame you see a complete regulated movement."
3483,"Dont' do day trade.. just sell it, after 1 month..
but must buy at the low Price.

LOW PRICE is the KEY to get the MONEY OUT..!!!! And sell it High!! Once you make 300% That is the KEY!!!
Once you getting into day trade you will lose and win.."
3484,"Well, this happens every day, still. Thank u very much"
3485,It's funny you bringing up toilet paper when covering pump and dumps🙃
3486,Thank you namaste.
3487,Your thumbnails are brilliant 🙌😂
3488,"Informative, and well presented. thank you!!! Guy."
3489,"I've heard others saying that the markets are being manipulated. Patterns and trends that fall apart when trading using analysis that should turn out a certain way... but way outside the normal scope of the varied success that any TA would generally produce. I just watched 14 minutes (3/6/2021; 20:45PST to 20:58PST) where the high ended up at 49,500.00 or 49,499.99 with only couple deviating by 50 cents or so. With an open market, I just see this as impossible. Am I seeing this correctly?"
3490,Binance has scaled the shit out of me

3511,"Another point for pump and dump- shitcoin may be promoted by Influencers who know nothing about crypto. I was a naive, newbie and got burned. Also, telegram groups who suck people in, don't tell them name of pumped coin until the second they say to buy, so followers have no chance to research. Newbies don't realize the scam is illegal."
3512,"I was day trading fine on Binance, until I started to invest in SNGLS. The recent pump and dump really got me, even though I bought it after the first big dump.
Also there's a lot of manipulated coins you should avoid on Kucoin. Once you buy them, the price will drop and you will have a hard time selling them even at the price of the day. for example CSP and TOKO. Once you sell them the price will go up. It's as if I was the only one who had some."

3521,A lot of very important information in a single video. Thank you so much!
3522,What exactly would you consider “shitcoins” as you mentioned
3523,"looking forward to the Launch of Ethereum 2.0 , could you please make a video about this transition . Thankyou ."
3524,"thanks, insightful video"
3525,Great topic. I've learned a lot from you. Thank you!
3526,"oh, shortly... it is about Binance."
3527,I think best way to avoid manipulation is to buy small amounts of bitcoin (only bitcoin)  regularly.  For example if you buy $100 bitcoin once a week rather than buying $10.000 bitcoin at once you don't rekt in long run.
3528,Another way to lose all your cryptocurrency is to fall for that (send me $25 in Bitcoin and I'll send you 1 Bitcoin) yeah ok only a dummy would fall for that bullshit cause there's no such thing as a Bitcoin Generator
3529,Is bittrex a good exchange?
3530,"Binance, reputable 🧐"
3531,"Cardano, BABB, U Network, Credit and Dent the hiden gems of 2020 and behind"
3532,F-social distancing.

3534,binance futures are really manipulated from the exchange as they hold infinite amount of usdt
3535,Can you look at the CEDEX coin?  They did perfectly scammed the investors and get away! Regards
3536,I lost 7 BTCs because of leverage trading ... STOP TRADING and you will not loose your BTCs ... ... TRADING is a full time job ... if you have a regular job then DON'T TRADE !!!
3537,"when Stop price on a Stop-Limit order is hit it turns into a Limit order of a lower price than the stop. it will get filled at the limit price or better anyway, so how does it give you any room to confirm its a capitulation point?"
3538,"Thanks Guy, another great video.
Do you have any views on Tether and whether government intervention could affect the crypto market?
In these unusual times, the central banks are going to extraordinary lengths to keep markets inflated - if there appears to be a flight to bitcoin or crypto in general, it is not inconceivable that they would take measures to prevent this and taking out tether (frequently the token with the highest daily volume) would potentially have a devastating impact."

3553,"Great educational video as always. 
I have a few suggestions for future videos. 
1 - I recently came across BiDao which is Binance's version of Maker. I like the idea of using BNB as collateral and using a trustless stable coin on the platform. 
2 - Also in regards to Defi, I would love to see a video on keyless crypto wallets such as ZenGo or Argent as I feel these are needed to onboard more users into the crypto space.
3 - Finally, in regards to NFTs and gaming I have been following a project called Ultra (UOS) which I consider to soon be an industry game changer. I would like your opinion.
Kindest regards,
Craig"

3558,Most major banks have been involved in money laundering or manipulating markets big time
3559,your my hero !
3560,Love your video but binance is really bad as well and cant be trusted
3562,"Great vid tonight, Guy.  Very informative.  Everyone new to the cryptoverse should watch it for their financial health.   The SEC, though, is a joke.  Remember the MF Global scam?  An ordinary guy smelled something wrong, gathered up tons of data and took it to the SEC.  Nothing happened.  He sent the same package to them a second time, still ignored.  When the Ponzi scheme tanked thousands of people lost their hard-earned retirement savings.  THAN the SEC closed it down and the CEO got jail time.


Jamie Dimon is the Hillary Clinton of the banking world.  JP Morgue has been manipulating the PM market and stocks for years.  The Feds show up and make a big deal about their trades, fine them $25,000,000 and tell him not to do it again.  It's a joke -  they pay the fine out of the billion dollars made on the illegal trades like paying $10 fine for robbing a bank of millions.  It's a lucrative venture he's got going there."
3563,Please do a review of DOVU’s DOV token.
3564,Awesome and informative video as always! I learned a lot :)
3565,"It's pretty simple to avoid all of these:

1. Don't day trade!
2. Do you own research on the project, team, CEO...
3. Do not think of it as buying coins/tokens, think of it as buying part of companies...Warren Buffet style (BTC included)
4. After you made your research buy coins/tokens it and make a plan (hold for #years,  hold till that price...) and follow the progres of project
5. Store coins/tokens of exchange on hard/paper wallet
 
That way you won't even notice all these market manipulations, because you'll know why you invested your money and what is your plan."
3566,Good Content 👍
3567,Don't trust coinbase They're just like a bank. I spent over $1500 last week with my tax money and they slowly keep taking all of my crypto back saying they never received any of my payments But my bank account is showing that they received the payments. Can anyone help me?
3568,"Save your btc? I used changeangel to swap btc for ltc a while back, i copied and pasted the send btc address. When i sent my btc to that address it got suspended and has remained there untouched.
My advice is to double and triple check each and every key and address. Your cryptos depend on it."
3569,"Great video! I'm new on crypto, and those are really important topics to listen to.
I have subscribed...offcourse!! Thank you so much."
3570,Good video. Thanks!! But I think your VALUABLE information is missing to refer leverage trading and how this casino approach makes greedy exchanges to manipulate massively the markets. Specially places like bybit and the many ‘shutdowns’ of binance.

3595,"Very nice and educative video i must say . From a technical point of view of crytocurrency , the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls, as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time, the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens, it might assist the market in reaching higher highs.

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!

The value of the coin comes from the need to hold and stake the coin in order to access the Bepro network, access to the network allows you to make the applications.

Staking of the token also incentivises people to hold it for monetary reward.

They have just announced a code base offering for NFT factories (Non fungible tokens are HUGE right now).

Also, they offer multi chain functionally - you can set up applications on either Ethereum, Polkadot or Binance Chain.

3734,"i just bought my first crypto last night. I dont have a lot of $, but i put $50 in Bitcoin, Etherian, Uniswap, Ada, and Sushiswap, just so i had a reason to learn. I could have bought Bitcoin when i got out of the military and if i did, i would have been disgustingly rich by now. So thanks for the knowledge you share, i may be the retarded kid in class, but at least i bought some cypto. i dont plan on pulling anything out, but once im more educated in the crypro/stock game, I'll start feeding some cash in it.

3751,"Nailed it Buddy... By  the beginning  of this weeks trade session, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that tradlng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Martin Sawyer program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2.6 Btc with Martin's  help.

3760,Bitcoin is crashing! Not it isn't this is what it does on a regular basis. The only numbers you should be looking at is year over year growth. If you can't stomach the dips or see them as an opportunity to buy more you are in the wrong place.

3763,"Nice contents you put up always👌.BTChits a new bullish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see now the market is very unstable , the truth is that you can always make more profit from trad n rather than just hodllng and waiting for the price of BTCto skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newb!es whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of trad n. I wept deeply and prayed after the last time i had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to Expt. Juliana Victoria who i started trad n with since late last year,i've covered up and made over 21 B T c even with the ups and downs since the journey .

Dont forget, that this trend rests on J.Biden, and knowing Democrats, they will do almost anything to integrate BTC usage in the companies, he would release a new policy which would be about the usage of BTC and companies (Democrats are all about E.Commerce, online shops, investing).

3783,BUY BTT!
3784,"Bitcoin isn't really decentralized. It has no actual value at all. It has no real use. It's not really scarce. Funds terrorism. It's extremely inefficient. It's extremely risky. It's a bubble. There are millions and millions of cryptos. Anyone can create a crypto. It's a ponzi scheme. It's a scam. And the worst sin of it: it's helping destroy our planet aggravating the climate change as mining unnecessarily and artificially consumes (wastes) as much electricity as countries like Argentina. Bitcoin can make 5-7 transactions per second, while the Visa network can perform 24,000 - with the energy of one Bitcoin transaction, Visa can make 500,000 transactions.
Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, said in his trilemma the blockchain can't be decentralized, scalable and secure at the same time."

3787,"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull, but BTCis going nuclear. A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Raymond who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months.

3900,"some say the market is crashing, I say that crypto is going on sale...   You don't lose anything until you sell, so don't pay attention to your portfolio value unless you are planning to sell.   So many people say they want to ""buy low/sell high"", but they get scared when it is low and sell their coins, and get greedy when it is high and buy more.  Learning that is when you start to make money.   ""be greedy when everyone else is fearful, be fearful when everyone else is greedy"" truly is the most important concept in trading/investing."

I don't think we will see a 530$ aave anytime soon so I cut my losses on that and sold at around 320 bucks.

4023,"Nice content you put up always👌.BTChits a new bullish price as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can all see how the market is very unstable, the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just holding and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket. Indeed it's a tough decision for both old and newb!es whose intentions are just to hold and sell but rather the potentials of trading.I wept deeply and prayed after the last time I had much loses, my Uncle introduced me to Expt. Brock Pierce. who I started trading with since late last year, I've covered up and made over 21 B T c even with the ups and downs since the journey. With Brock Pierce, I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin. For profess!onal guidance, you can easily get to Brock on Telegram; ( @Pierce_Signals ) 👈"

4095,"OK I 'm a newbie, I get supply and demand, as well as a stock price.  Help me explain- If a stock starts at 1 dollar, and there's high demand, then who is the one saying "" ok now that everybody wants this stock im going to raise it to 2 dollars? why doesn't the stock just 'run out' at its in initial dollar value when its listed for sale.  There must be an actual formula or something that automatically raise the price from a dollar as people buy. Who is it that's actually observing the pool, and calculating the new price, as more people enter?  Is it a computer algorithm? I mean it's got to be a person or something that raises the price, up or down? I don't know if I am making since? From my point of view, little digits move up or down on my screen faster then any of us can predict, based on volume. I'm thinking there's a fearful/greedy man on the other side of my screen (they, we, wall street, computer robot?) changing the price. You mention the social diversity and perception is unique about the Market, but that's the public now who is the referee for the price changing, because buyers don't want the price to go up, unless they become sellers. Thus a feedback loop is created, due to the fact I can't predict what john doe is going to do with his stock, and the companies reputation.  Ultimately something is determining the price base on several factors, I get the public, and the apparatus, but not the formula and how its used and implemented, as I see market inhale and exhale as it lives and dies."

4131,"I sold my ETH, not out of fear it wont pump. it very well may. But even if it 10x im not mad to have sold. Ethereums fundamentals are pretty pretty bad compared to other projects right now. But i feel like people who were around for the 2017 bullrun are massively blinded by experience. Back then there was nothing to pump except ETH, so i feel like people now expect it to do the same. But why would it? We have loads of better alternatives to invest in compared to 2017, and the market caps are way lower than ETH too. Maybe im an ""ETH hater"" but im pretty sure this is an emotional investment at this point, rationally, i dont see it making any sense compared to alternatives."

Price prediction for that alt coin is ten dollars this year, if it hits the mark, that 4,000 dollar investment a year ago would be 1 million at the 10 dollar mark.

4166,As an Indian let me update everyone - The finance minister confirmed a few days back that they will not be banning Crypto. The only institution which wants a complete ban is the central bank of the Country (RBI) but the government wants to take a more pragmatic approach.
4167,"At the point when bitcoin hits sixty thousand , which has for some time been probably the biggest position , changed over piece of its monetary record money into bitcoin recently . Different organizations have additionally progressively embraced digital currency , either by supporting installments and moves or really purchasing the assets . The Bull run has begun an it is simply shrewd to focus available . As hard as it is trading Crypto , it sure is much more rewarding and is very sensible on the off chance that you simply learn and focus on what's happening , I'm not a genius trad er but rather I was sufficiently fortunate to make 29BTC since toward the end of last year following the instructlons and signals from Garric Norman .

4170,BitBoy sit down and take notes mate!!😉😂
4171,We are looking at an extended bull run. The first peak of several may be September but the amount of capital yet to flow into the space is massive. Scales of magnitude higher. Which will take years for the capital pool to fill up. When you see bitcoin being posted all over Facebook or your local bank offering “bitcoin savings accounts” is when it is peaking. I suspect it may be around 2025 when the bull run really cools off.

NULS is not so well known yet, but it will soon be a very hot commodity in the cryptocurrency market.
The potential for growth is huge, and the current market capitalization is so tiny and that’s why really most honestly, when the price explodes and the real fomo starts, I expect a spectacular multiple increase!

Crypto tends to act like stocks as opposed to bonds (obviously), so it isn’t surprising that March would be rough. I thought March would be a lot worse tbh, despite the huge red in my stock brokerage account this month. It came back well recently.

4366,The only reason somethings has value is because there is someone willing to pay the price . If people think BTC will hit 200k then people will buy up to 150k -180k . That's how I know 100k is guarenteed this bull run . Because EVERYONE IS SAYING 100K MINIMUM

4372,"Nailed it Buddy... By  the beginning  of this weeks trade session, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market; as for me it can’t be more obvious that tradlng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Aaden Jones program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2.6 Btc with Aaden's  help.

4373,One of your best videos. nothing but the truth! I like!
4374,Thank you for this information
4375,"The bitcoin cycles can be predicted based on history. I understand you will not get an exact date, but a good window is perfectly logical. It has been so for the past decade. Why would you not assume there will be the same phases in the cycle as before? We're definitely going to reach a peak some time this year (potentially early next year) and after the parabolic there will be a bear market. Industry investment will simply dampen the the volatility and/or lengthen the cycles but this is typical of a maturing asset. The low at the tail-end of the market might only be a 50-60% price reduction from peak and that bear market correction will reduce progressively after each cycle until sometime in the long term, the bitcoin volatility will be more or less stable compared to current."

4567,"The reason why we broke out in February was because we had news of Tesla buying $ 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, which served as a major catalyst in further creating new all-time highs. Up until that point, we were on a downward trend and eventually trading sideways, like we're seeing now. It wasn't a technical breakout that drove Bitcoin to new highs in February, it was more fundamental news of adoption by major institutions. We need to see more of that if we're going to repeat the growth that we saw last month. Until then, I have a feeling that we're going to be trading down and sideways, looking at the current situation I would suggest tredlnq with Daniel Wright to.make more gains from all this as I have made over 8btc in just 3 waeks of trading with hlm, here are his details on Tel- gram ( @Danielwrightfx) for his assistance on strictly crypto related.."

4682,"BlTC0IN is becoming more appealing to lnvestors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios. The U.S. investment bank noted that high volatility “acts as a headwind towards further adoption.” The signs that BlTC0IN’s volatility is diminishing could see it “crowding out goId” as a portfolio diversifier and suggests a long-term price target which makes now the right time to stack up more BlTC0IN.  I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Justin Fulton of CTU who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months.

4703,"Nice content mate.Before the kickoff of the current week's exchanging meeting, moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investor to decide how best to utilize the current market as for me it can’t be more obvious that trading Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodlng and waiting for the price of Bit coin to skyrocket.

4729,"I agree with all your points, nobody knows where B TC will go, Surely I wouldn’t invest in it as a retirement asset, I don’t think it will ever replace fiat (Both because of its limited availability also because it would take generations to do that)and most of all because now at (almost) All-time highs is in my opinion not the best moment to enter.
Nevertheless I’m happy I enter sometime ago and I’m holding. None has a crystal ball but in my humble opinion, most people just take about B TC, which is just the tips of the iceberg, I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn’t mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. I advice that we all follow a less talked about way which is trad!ng. I was about to generate more than 9B TC with 1. 4 B TC in an interval of 6 weeks from using the tradё signal Garric Norman has a Tel egram @garric_norman_fct for more insights"

4735,"<<This bull run looks a mix of the previous two. Currently the PI indicator is about to indicate a Bitcoin top.  According to bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year.I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all this changed when I encountered Garric 's service., although I have been into numerous services but Garric Norman  stands out with experienced expertise in the field.

4900,"crypt0currency hit a fresh record high for the first time in three years as people increased their bids
 in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can see now the market is very unstable , the truth
 is that you can always make more profit from tradn rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of 
BT C to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl 
and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price 
chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started trad!n with Tayler Samm I 
no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin , you can easily reach on tele ; grm  at

4901,"It’s really mind boggling that Bitcoin has major ties in China, that was very concerning to me from the get go , but I found a comfort level when I saw Michael Saylor , Raul Pal and others in big biz loading up on BTC , figured , these guys are obviously not fools ... Like every other market, if there’s a way to be manipulated, it will be, just finding it fascinating, yet again, that when people find a decentralized monetary vehicle to break away from govt / mainstream, it will just happen to have ties to a Communist country like China, that is likely America’s greatest enemy right now, other than our own govt itself, Lol ...
I do believe crypto is here to stay, but unless China changes like Russia did years ago, there will eventually be a pivot away from Bitcoin to many others with great technological use cases, in my humble opinion... 
Thanks Ben for all the great info you bring, great blessings and investing to all ..."

The entire stock market, crypto-currency market and all financial markets are always manipulated and all that you and I and anyone else can do is nothing more than speculate. You complain about the Chinese being responsible for the dumps how about Buffet and his gang which sold out airline shares just before nine eleven and just before the Plandemic outbreak, what about them??

Your money will all be gone. In a couple of minutes and nobody will be able to prove who took it because it was stolen through Bitcoin. In fact, you voluntarily gave them your money. 

Buy etherium, cardano, polka dot or chainlink. Don’t touch Bitcoin. It is toxic because of the coordinated demolition planned by the miners."

5135,The chinese govt do not wast competition for their own digital currency  thewill attempt to destroy Btc in offer to make the yuan the new world reserve currency in place of the dollar. We all know  it’s already game over for the dollar but the cccp didn’t bank on Btc  becoming adopted by the global institutions  before the yuan had full global exposure. The only hope is for  a couple of  national  governments to put BTC  PUBLICLY into   their  reserves.  even better  if they start strategically mining   Just a thought   Ps all businesses  in China are government controlled  that includes the Btc miners

5171,"I am no crypto expert at all. As a regular guy with a bit of knowledge of how supply & demand can be manipulated, to advantage a few, I have always had this thought that crypto is no different. It's a whole new asset class than the traditional asset classes for sure. But money goes in and out. Bitcoin will definitely hit very high values in times to come. That too will be manipulated I am sure. Remember that China did not become the economic power it is today, without Globalist Zionist meddling. China has been set up since the early 70's for exactly this day & age very cunningly by currency controllers. China is just a useful instrument in the hands of the few who controls the globe. How will the few get us all into their coming CEFI digital currencies? Destroy the DEFI system. May make loads of profit before everything implodes,and  form parallel sustainable economies outside the Zionist Globalist matrix."

5220,this is what i was thinking. we are under chinise miners. if miners want to dump on us whenever they want we fucked up. we have to find other crypto like btc that is not owning by fucking chinise miners
5221,"don't understand. china miners are allowed to dump if they want no?  let us make a video on who are the bastard hod'ling bitcoin and causing the price to rise.  china is as communist as USA... bitcoin was born due to collusion between gov and banks. there would be no bitcoin is USA was a true capitalist country. they would not have been ""too big to fail"" in 2008.

I can say i have had my fair share of loses over the years i made loses to the extent that I almost quit. Until late last year when i was introduced to an Expt. David B. Hardy, with his assistance i have covered up and made 20 BTC📈📈, despite the fluctuations and all. with David i no longer have to worry about the ups and downs of BTC✔.

5261,"The sharp recovery in major altcoins and Bit: zion suggests the uptrend remains intact. Although the bears tried to start a correction today, the long tail on the day's candlestick suggests the bulls are in no fashion to relent. If the bulls can sustain the buying pressure and push the price above $ 50k, the BTCpair may witness a short squeeze that could quickly propel the price to $ 60k. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I'm not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s!

5338,HENRYYY !!!
5339,What goes down must come up
5340,"This dude is nothing but a clickbait pump and dump channel. Last video was about how BTC goes to 306K, and now this with a ridiculous title and a bunch of emojis. The simple fact is this chud is guessing AT BEST and should not be relied upon for any decent advice. Do your own research, read your own charts. Cons like this, Ivan, and most of the other crypto channels are just part of a racket of people that can barely read a wave chart let alone predict what's going to happen with crypto in 6 months."

5378,Leave my home state of Wisconsin out of this Ben lmao!!🤣
5379,"It is hard to have a bull run when there is a constant dump. The crypto market will not be a natural market until the manipulation stops. There must be some way where Bitcoin can no longer affect the whole market. Maybe some genius can create a new crypto currency that cannot be manipulated. Shieldcoin would be a great name to keep the market balanced and healthy. Otherwise, bull runs and bear runs will always be dump runs. This will scare many investors away from Bitcoin if they keep getting wrecked. It is a sad time for Crypto."

5415,i thought this was mmcrypto video by the title
5416,Bro you are actually clueless on this stuff. No way in hell bitcoin goes that low. It’s about to break out tomorrow morning.
5417,Bitboy got the entire library 📚 of crypto books 🙃
5418,"You’re not really making any sense... So, if China wants to, they could keep the price down indefinitely?  What about the Billions of dollars that Tesla and other Hedge Funds just put into BTC?  Are we all screwed, or will it eventually go back up?"

Am I missing something? Unless it's just for fun to trade."

5426,Maybe its time to regulate the bitcoin miner..limit the bitcoin that they sell..they are the one who really win in this trade.
5427,look at the 2017 chart vs the 2020-21 chart its pratically the same dips and pattern this is the end of the cycle see you guys in 2023 when the next cycle begin

5438,"If we know F2pool and other China based mining pools are selling off massive amounts of BTC and control over 50% of the hash rate,..doesn't that mean the entire Bitcoin network is compromised by the Chinese Communist Party? Is BTC a brilliant plan to ultimately transfer more wealth to CCP? Is the CCP Satoshi?"
5439,Did u ban me ?
5440,Is there anyway you can join the F2 pool to know when to alert us that there will be a dip?

5442,How's Cardano doing?? 😀

5449,Good job thx
5450,"I don't want to hurt the Bull run but China owns Bitcoin. If they wanted to do a 51% attack they could, but it would destroy the value of Bitcoin. China won't do this because they own too much Bitcoin unless... they sell it all off... 🤔 (that's what these dumps are about) And if Bitcoin becomes valueless they could switch all their mining hardware to do this to Litecoin or Bitcoin cash ect. The only hope we really have for a true decentralized cryptocurrency is a project like NIMIQ. You and altcoin daily turned me on to it during your interview with them. My portfolio is 55% Cardano and 45% NIMIQ. I'M NOT HOLDING ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S TRULY VALUELESS. 🤷‍♂️ However I'm a massive believer in cryptocurrency and its future to dominate finance and the entire internet. ✊ Long live the open source!"

5460,This guy is so wrong it won't go below 45k! I thought this guy was an expert!? If he's right then ill make sure I call him and apologize
5461,"So, what about Theta Fuel? Will that go down too?"
5462,Giant dumps equal huge rises in next 4 to 8 weeks after... I'm glad it dumped hard .. All the coins will be reset to rise on a fairly equal playing field in a way ... Them big buyers are smiling and getting ready to buy the crap out of crypto... Yep
5463,"Sell all of your coin, we wait & buy back at the deep"

5477,"Maybe the whales who were long on the futures fell short of their price prediction and did not expect the price of BTC to go beyond 50k. Michael Saylor's conference happened after the renewal of the futures contract so they were not able to factor in the positive impact of the conference relative to their forecast.

Futures contract will expire on Friday 4 pm London time or 11 am Eastern time. I expect more dumps up to the last minute to ensure that the price of bitcoin stays below 50k. After that, the price of bitcoin will blast to the moon."

5486,ADA leading the BULL MARKET. I so actually believe ADA started this BULL MARKET too...
5487,Every single coin in my portfolio is down except  ADA 🚀🚀
5488,"Come on Ben, giving all these new investors risky, terrible advice to short BTC (which only makes your own short positions more likely) and then suggesting they use your sponsored platform to do it so you get a commission on their trades? You just had the Bybit CEO on today explaining how you make money from the referrals! I enjoy your content, but you're better than this."
5489,I mean it's seems to me that you can't give a disclaimer your not and then turn around tout your influence and scare 50k viewers out of the market.
5490,"Nugget News seems like a cool guy to get on the channel, in a recent video he shared a lot about shorting the bear market and making money on the way down."
5491,"I already dumped 75% of my coins, all converted to USDT waiting for the big dip."
5492,This guy Bitboy is working for whales.

5494,"Well, China is a semi communist country ran by a communist party."
5495,Stop being pussies. You are part of the problem if your selling BTC. HOLD and dont let F2 pool tank BTC. Is someone paying you off bitboy....WTF. IF BTC GOES DOWN BUY MORE AT THE DOSCOUNTED PRICE!!!
5496,Buy the dip and sell the next day when it recovers. Rinse and repeat
5497,The longest the government keeps blocking the biggest swaps on USA we are fuck
5498,Basically you say it's going lower when it is already going lower...and you say it's going higher if it is already going higher...not really any great advice .... actually kinda crappy advice
5499,Ben relax you are scaring the kids.
5500,Pffft. I never thought I'd say this...Thanks China!

5507,Looking like Tai Lopez with all them books
5508,I’m holding for 3 more cycles.  Not panic selling.  Buy the dip !!! Sale !!!
5509,Lol this guy is definitely shorting. He and his buddy's know wtf is going on. He's not a little fish by far. Literally everyone is saying it's going down to 41-42k. These youtubers are whales. Elliotrades is a shady prick along with lark and his binance bs.
5510,Buy Sparkpoint and OMI big gains coming very soon!!
5511,"The price dump, or the F2pool selling has nothing to do with Chinese government. If anything, US gov, US Federal Reserve and Treasury, they are the biggest enemy of crypto. In fact, Chinese are FOMOing in crypto, seeking every possible way to participate. China is also leading in CDBC, while interests groups in US have been thwarting crypto since very beginning."
5512,You have the book Boundaries. That's a great one!
5513,"So at some point the first pool won't be dumping ,for 2 reasons 1 the lack of volume ,2 would they dump at a price substantially lower than what btc price hit???"
5514,ADA and MATIC is sacing my ass right now... Or id be down so bad
5515,Totally agree with your video but I’m gonna say something... China ain’t communist. They’re ultra capitalist . The entire economy and life model is about that right now. The difference it’s that China is a country with government control on hardcore mode with different moral standards :)
5516,YouTube will silence the president but can't get rid these annoying hacking bots commenting on every comment. hysterical
5517,Isn’t it more important who’s buying? Which appears to be American business. If they are selling then they are loosing market and power. They can only sell so much.

5523,I really don't see it going that low..I could be wrong
5524,i bet there is a group manipulating the market and coordinating a dump then setting a buy limit to pick up cheaper coins. ive seen this in video games with exchange markets such as runescape.
5525,ADADADADA
5526,It went up to fast. Then it's not a dump
5527,Thumbs downing for clickbait
5528,Bro U dont know shit about TA and the fact that you advocate shorting bitcoin makes you a traitor. If you connect all the recent tops with a line you can see the new resistance that we jest now bounced off
5529,"Big fan of Bit Boy but I’m wondering when he will realize that when traditional stocks have a bad day it drags Bitcoin down as well? I’d like to see Bit Boy crypto tie that into their analysis. He talks like a traditional stock collapse wouldn’t affect BTC, when others say that would effectively end the bull market"
5530,"Wow it's true, dogs really do resemble their owners!"
5531,Show us how to lose money...fok u

5537,"Dear Ben, you really don't know about China. Lol."
5538,"New World Order just around the Corner, It's almost dumb not to hold any decentralized currency such as bitcoin I'm sure you don't want to miss out on the best investment/plan of the last decade, partaking in infusing on Bitcoin is not only a good decision but also one of the best and reliable investment to ingest in, or are you afraid you don't know how to trade you can buy at low cost and sell at a very splendid price with the help of a good crypto expert and analyst sometimes Fear, uncertainty, and doubt cause volatility to spike, but that doesn't mean you had bad luck. Moreover, Bitcoin is impaling even higher ,with the help price action strategy I was able to increase my portfolio from just in just couple of trades of using , if know you are interested, newbie or will like to increase your portfolio you can reach mrs Amelia Paul on Telegram >> @Ameliatrades1 Goodluck! lets make the best of whatever"
5539,"LOL, thumbnail seems vaguely familiar."
5540,There are many profitable investment  online but one of the best is bitcoin
5541,"Love the channel and your work! Just thinking out loud here, but what if BTC is a commie plot to draw in the whole world and then all these Chinese miners which are owned by the CCP pull the plug and cause BTC to go to zero? They’d wreck the whole world and thus could take over. Admittedly, kind of far fetched but want to put it out there. Cheers!"
5542,pump and dump benny
5543,Bitboy getting those like and subscriptions like he asked in return for his speculative nonsense. He ain't worried at all. You tube has him covered
5544,"This man is pretending to be expect what the fuck random guesses everywhere 

Everyone knows btc will is not going anywhere it will grow and grow 😎"
5545,"Bitcoin price just finally blasted well above 50K for the first time in history. With the leading cryptocurrency by market cap having no clear resistance above it, it has now entered price discovery mode, and where to next is anyone's guess. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I'm not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s! Gnals from benpaul . He runs programs for investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trad! ng Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin. You can easily get to him on 𝗧𝗲𝗜𝗲q𝗿𝗮𝗺 @benpaull"
5546,Seems fine to me
5547,so when should i look to buy BTC? at what price?
5548,4 hours ago you said bitcoin to 306k soooooooo............LOL
5549,Bitcon is a security as the profits and price relies heavily on the success and selling at the Mining pools
5550,"It's been execpected I have buys set in at 42, 40 and 38 .... But our bottom main trend line is around 37k"

5555,Bens wife sure has a lot of books 😂
5556,Sell time
5557,I'm ok cuz I'm all in on ada
5558,Fuf2
5559,Can we see your High School Diploma please?
5560,Alright here I'll say it. Btc was invented because we got tired of the big banks and corperations minipulations of stocks and gold etc. What do we do ? All cheer when they buy and make big corperations and get together with all the same folks that were shoving it way up whare the sun dont shine....... Back to square one. Should have kept the banks out. There I said it
5561,"It makes total sense, you have to wonder who is controlling alot of this if it is being controlled by one entity as i think co-incidence is a complete load of crap"
5562,I would love to see you on Tim Pool’s show.
5563,So glad I set a stop loss
5564,Now the whales will hear ADA saved too many people and will attack ADA to scoop the rest
5565,"Great update Ben. I know exactly what you mean when your talking about more going on here than it seems. But yes, your right. All BTC mining pools in China are in fact under the direct control of the CCP. Lol! Just spit it out Ben! Lol!"
5566,"Way too much good news from companies buying, etc. for it to fall much farter. Not everyone is in love with a 1.5% bond yield."
5567,I'm in long
5568,Long at $48K and consider short at $46K. What could have developed in 2 hours that would arrive at that ?
5569,Its profit taking and they trying to bring it lower its hard to buy a dip that hi.holding its your money.what i would do is convert one coin to polkadot and hold.its up to the big boys what they do.21mil compared to ten mil.whats more rear.

5572,If this is coordinated...then where is the idea that decentralization helps keep this a savings platform?? Satochi in his great wisdom forgot one of human's greatest flaws ....greed
5573,I think we are looking at this the wrong way. F2pool is doing us a service by dropping btc's price. We can get cheaper BTC. altcoins and it's keeping BTC from overheating and ending this bullrun early. USA needs to buy BTC just like most of the smart money in this country is doing... Keep China from 51% attacks
5574,Oh well I bought all my bitcoin with money I won on Chinese slots at Hollywood Gaming 😃 and tomorrow when I go to the bank and deposit what I won today I’m gonna buy somemore  LoL!!!
5575,Bitcoin will go wherever the manipulators want it to go. You wanted all of the manipulators from the major institutions to buy in and they have. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are just a big casino.
5576,You guys look alike.

5585,Sux when miners dump that's their job though ppl take profit mining takes money how much do you actually make when you sell a Bitcoin you mine there's a lot of electricity it's the same thing with gold miners control a lot
5586,Don’t short!
5587,"Doesn't this dump you speak of defeat the ideal of having a trustless network? How can these dumps stop if the blockchain protects their identities? In the long run, the price of Bitcoin will keep rising. However, it doesn't give a fair opportunity to all. Nothing wrong with the computers, sadly it's the humans who are operating them."
5588,should we load up on (CRV)CURVE DAO?  The all-time-high is $54.00 and right now its only $2.00. Once Defi season kicks into high gear the price should pump due to new partnership with Polkadot and YFI

5628,Lol they always say dogs look like their owners 😂
5629,Ethereum is a hedge against Cardano.
5630,Have you considered the possibility of a self fulfilling prophecy.  That these things (like this video) generate fear (or the greed of potential opportunity to sell and buy back cheaper) which creates the selling that actually cause the dip... Just a thought.
5631,"Bro.. Drop the stupid face thumbnail theatrics that all others use, it makes you look desperate. You are better than that, much love"

5634,I’m holding!
5635,"I thought the same thing when watching Crypto Daily's vid (love that guy; his vids are the highlight of my days). The likely hood that thousands of individual minors from f2pool all sell on the same hour is pushing it. In the same day at a ATH? Sure; it can happen. Obviously there's gonna be a lot of sellers on ATH days. But that much from 1 pool in 1 hour? That shit reeks of coordinated efforts. Especially dumps like just now where we weren't even at a top. I haven't looked at any outflows for tonight (and don't have the access to one), but if they were all dumping right now? That's definite evidence of manipulation. There's no way a shit-ton of random minors would have just dumped at the same time when we weren't even back up to that 57-58 mark yet. Also, I heard somewhere that buyers are paying premiums for coins without any transaction history. This might be why they're not even bothering with dollar-cost-averaging out. They might be getting higher bids for them freshly minted stacks so aren't concerned with the current selling price. Just something to think about."
5636,@zaincrypto on telegram Get touch with him he's the best 🤝
5637,So is someone going to beat them up with a wet noodle? Call them names?  Shake a finger at them?
5638,"Communist funded mining pools, these pools have an unfair advantage."
5639,"At this rate, wouldn’t you think F2pool and miners will have limited Bitcoin to dump eventually?"
5640,Anyone can sell at any time. Stop throwing a fit bro.. Who cares what they do.
5641,Let me guess. You predicted this as well?
5642,"my charts are telling me from this time of posting up volume to 49395 then if we still have buying volume 50900 then possible resistance, if buying continues with this move top at 52825 before retracement. opinion only... babysitting trade"
5643,2:22 for Freudian Slip
5644,"OK, so if what you are saying is true.......how is this not a huge problem for Bitcoin going forward?  If it's that easy for miners to coordinate and royally tank the price, then investing in Bitcoin is a house of cards that could collapse at any moment.  We all understand that Bitcoin is volatile, but what you are describing sounds very serious and I'm not sure if there is a solution to that problem."
5645,this guy keeps validating the fact that bitcoin is not a decentralized as people think

5648,Ben are you losing weight?
5649,"Here’s a question!! If China is doing a lot of the mining why would anyone want btc, mining in my opinion in the end the rich get richer. As it gets harder to mine places like China and their cheap power government controlled everything can control the coin. Your better off in stake pools. Just thinking out loud right? So if I’m reading this right China has every btc holder by the balls? Anyone else think the same? So a government supported entity like China can use oh say the largest dam in the world’s hydroelectric power to mine btc .. just thinking out loud any thoughts?"

5658,more dogs in your videos please
5659,"Stop dumping the market. YOU ARE AN INFLUENCER.  If your 500k followers dump 100k BTC into the market, what do you think happens?  You ARE the market, WE ARE.  What we decide, effects the market, or creates it with enough influence.  Think like a LEADER, a market maker, not a pawn."
5660,And yet you still ignore the Binance corruption.  You are supporting this by supporting Binance.
5661,"If I would say anything on the topic, I think Bitcoin will grow rapidly when Ethereum adds the major improvement to the system. I am not concerned about the decrease in Bitcoin value. I think you should mention how you can buy some cryptocurrencies on PayPal. This makes it easier for the average joe to get into cryptocurrencies. You can only buy and sell through PayPal; however, you gain something else in nature: potential fraud protection. PayPal controls the public and private keys, but I think this will protect ignorant crypto buyers from some scams. The 4 cryptos you can purchase on Paypal are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and LItecoin. Think of Paypal as a Crypto security box in a bank. PayPal simply holds onto it until you ready to sell. I think the fact you can buy Crypto through PayPal needs more attention."

5678,"""let them off the hook"".  What hook? Why are you always talking like we control F2? It's obviously the opposite, they are controlling us.  So why the false narrative that they must obey us? It sucks, but if there is a solution it doesn't start with believing that we control them."

We had a great bounce to over 50%.  Yes, the pullback today is a little extreme, but it's also at 1hr OS so we could easily get a  bounce here.

I am wondering why I did not hear all this about mining pools dumping, the CCP possibly having control, etc before now on all these crypto channels.  No better that the precious metals guys.  What BS.  You all sit in your echo chamber and stroke each others egos and lure new people in with your lies and misinformation.  Just as bad as the metals guys, and that is a very big insult.  Its going up any day now.  Yup Yup the dollar is going to 0, the banks will freeze up, bank bail in, mad max beyond thunderdome, you better save yourself by buying gold and silver.  Crypto guys, same BS accept add on ""bitcoin is going to 400K this year.  I bought gold and silver last year, when I told my friends they looked at me like I was from Mars.  Same with Bitcoin.  Well, looks like they were right on both accounts.  Ohhh and if the Chinese are in control of huge amounts of bitcoin, then yes, that means the CCP is in control of every last Satoshi.   And if this is true, then we are truly screwed.  The CCP will chew up Michael Sailor and spit him out so easy.  The CCP runs most of the planet right now, they will use bitcoin to destroy anyone, and you won't stop it.  Don't sell your bitcoin, it is going well boyond 6 digits.

5709,The CCP tells their miners who they are allowed to sell to I heard it from a Chinese miner with my own ears. If they tell them who to sell to they tell them how much to sell. If not the give it all away. So dump it for money so china can scoop it up for cheap or give it to china.

6273,"most experienced traders like myself would rather learn proper skills to analyze price charts in making our own trading decisions, but many traders out there especially amateur traders still wonder if they can really fast-track their trading success using Signal Services only, now don't get me wrong, signals are great, especially if you find the right one, but it is also smart if traders could be able to positively and accurately analyze price charts to get good trade results. if we closely have a look at some of the main reasons why people fail to make money from investing/trading online. whether it is stock trading, binary options, forex or cryptocurrencies, you will find out that the problem lies on traders being lazy and depending too much on signal services and also lack understanding of trading before going into it. so to be on the safe side it is best for traders, especially those still learning and practicing how to trade should know these tips first before entering into any online investment scheme: 1.Use a signalling service. ... 2.Learn to use technical indicators. ... 3.Trade stocks before trading binary options. ... 4.Track your performance in each trade option security. ... 5.Buy the right option length for your trading style. for more tips and trading strategies that can get you $20k-$40k per month kindly get in touch with me by mail as i am ready to show interested traders, both newbies, pros and amateurs how to trade confidently and make good profits using strategies that fetches $20-$40k per month. joephethan135@gmail.com)"

6275,"@Kevin Samuels   @Game of Trade  crypto currency is social and economic control exerted on the ones foolish enough to buy them, by the one who owns the server and source code. Crypto currency is bank robbery by creating an invisible bank. The value of crypto currency is balanced by the control of manufacturing, research and development of the one who owns the source and server and who does not create products for you but for himself and his own people. So if you have crypto currency, you have to eat the server and code owner's food, water, socialise the way he says and your kids never do anything for themselves that the owner of the hardware of the currency doesn't accept. It is electronic slavery. Invest in your own independent labs, research and development, production factories and sale of what your own people use every day or the crypto currency hardware owner will control you."

6355,"I ordered a CK5 from coin mining central. 2 months after the order I was wondering where my miner was 2 weeks after it was to ship to me and they informed me they had more orders than miners in the batch when they had origins put them up for sale. But despite 3 separate emails they never informed me my miner would not be shipped until last email sent yesterday. When you buy a miner, they tells you to pay within an hour to confirm your order, which I did the day I ordered it. So they knew I was not going to get my miner, but kept my money for 2 months before informing me. During that time profitability went up And they “received” another batch of the same miner which they offered at 2.5x what I paid when profitability was lower. I don’t know if they resold it to someone else at higher cost or not. They then offered me 2 miners . One at 50% of profitability of CK5 and one at 10% of profitability. The one at 50% they offered to me at 1500 pound more than the CK5. So they want me to pay more money , even though goldshell site has it at $1000 less than CK5. This people are evil, bait and switch and I only dealt with them because of Voskcoin endorsement but later on I’m so much amazed that I was able to get back all I spent  to them with the help of junkywarriorscom team now I deal with this new site and get the coin in next 4 hours after payment"

If you have only 500 usd.

If you buy bitcoin using 500 usd - there is no chance that bitcoin will hit from 60ooo to 120ooo so you will double your investments.

If you buy some coin at 0.12 usd per coin and that coin will hit 0.70 (which is more possible) than you will earn more than doing the same on bitcoin.

Got scammed in some dodgy projects and lost lot of money and got scared off. Decided to try to get back in 2 months back taking baby steps. It gets a bit addictive as I have ended up buying over 100 coins even though in most it's about 30 dollars. Even though most are making money not sure when to sell them. Hopefully the alt season will continue for a couple of months. Thank you so much for good advice.

6825,"Thanks for this, #6 being mother of all advices. Just got into this, trying to learn the ropes. The biggest money in my opinion is to be made from facilitating the hype people are responding to; crypto exchanges and crypto banking. Fees fees fees."
6826,"It makes money by getting new people to buy in at higher and higher rates. How is that NOT a pyramid scam? 

Somebody the government is going to use some of their ALL ENCOMPASSING INTERNET SURVEILLANCE to scrub Block-Chains at the internet backbone. No block-chains, no Crypto. It'll get pushed as an Anti-Crime bill, or something, since much cyrpto is used for criminal activity. Banks will secretly grease the pockets of the legislators that push the bill. As it's hard to tax what can't be taxed, and left-wing governments LOVE to spend money, that'll be another force."

6833,my number one tip for any investment is that if you somehow get emotionally invested in the assets you have invested. Then investing probably isn't for you!  if you on the other hand can watch your assets drop a lot and not care. walk away while keeping your investment going. then the investment is for you!

6961,I would never invest in stocks if u owe a lot on credit cards or high interest loans bcuz the returns on the stocks wont even cover ur interest costs. Pay off debt 1st.  Now crypto is a little different in my opinion bcuz u have a chance to make big gains fast but the opposite is also true.  Personally after I paid my car off and got my credit debt down to basically nothing then I started with stocks and crypto.  But I'm actually considering selling off the stocks bcuz I have a feeling the market is going to crash.  I will hold onto my crypto and I will keep buying some here and there but I'm basically going to save $ in the bank getting ready for the big crash so I can buy in low.  Also gold and silver wouldn't be a bad idea either.  It's all about diversifying.

7055,"I think chain games crypto will be the best investment, it’s already growing fast, when it will get on the big platforms it will be skyrocket"
7056,"I don't get it man. If I have let's say 1000 US in bitcoin and I hang on to it and let it sit for lets say 5 years, what will the amount turn to in 5 years? Its so pointless to me. Just cash it out."
7057,"Buy High sell Low 😆 I lost it. Joke's apart, great vid man."
7058,Just buy when it is low and forget about it and only look it up if you hear in the media that it is increasing if it decreases pay no attention  as you must have stipulated the price you are going to sell at even if it takes 10 years to reach there. Selling at lower price should never be an option as you should only buy with money you can spare and will at all not change a bit of your life if you lose it all or not.
7059,Simple but Informative
7060,Great stuff. I watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the stock market but haven't made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and I do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands.

7235,"As an investor those 6 points are rock solid 👌.

But as a scalper again it's the opposite to the first 5 points. 6 is a no no for any type of trading and Investing."
7236,"Bitcoin isn't volatile.... the dollar is. 1 BTC is still worth 1 BTC
since its inception. Can we say that about the dollar? $1 from 1913 to
2020 is worth ~$20 according to an inflation calculator. So, which one
is really volatile? People need to stop looking at the price through
the lens of the dollar. Everyone sees the dollar value of Bitcoin but
don't realize that it's the dollar that is weak against BTC....that's
why there are huge price swings. People also don't realize that every
time they sell or buy crypto, they are expanding the current monetary
money supply. If you know how the current monetary system works, that
last statement will make perfect sense. If not, it will go over
heads.I take the risk of lower prices on the short term for granted,
knowing that the prices will be much higher on the long term. I am not
taking the risk of not having invested what I could (because I was
waiting for lower prices) and than not take full advantage of the bull
run.There is a significant difference between stocks which can be
based on professional advice held and currencies (cryptocurrency), and
this is because most of them are hypes and highly speculative. I have
made over $80,000 in the last two months day trading my BTC which I am
sure would be a fantasy if I where hodling. I trade with a platform
that is highly skilled in the cryptocurrency business, I was
introduced by Mr Eric bishop, I am aiming for higher highs. If you
have any inquiries, you can reach him on Gmail(eric.bishop100@gmailcom) I am spreading this for those who
are unable to turn in consitent profit in the crypto market



I started investing in Cryptocurrency fairly recently. Coming from a
non-technical background, understanding blockchain and crypto currency
is a little tricky. So to understand it better I invested USD 1000 and
started to pay attention to everything related to Cryptocurrency. i
made 2 BTC real quick in 2018, later lost 1BTC early 2019, i was still
trying hard to understand the market but everything was new to me
again (nightmare). I began to read several blog post and following
YouTube video tutorials to understand how I can make profit but the
more I try, the more I loose more of my Bitcoin. So not until I found
a beginners trading post talking about a strategy on how to trade and
make profit and I contacted the person in charge, Mr bishop he
explained to me the different ways to make profit in this bearish
market. I decided to give it a try and I invested 2 BTC of my coin,
and it quickly rose to 8 BTC towards the end of December 2019,and I
was convinced it is the best way to make a good profit from Bitcoin.
If you're still confused about the steps to take this year I urge you
to contact Eric.bishop100@gmail.comfor all
your cryptocurrency questions, strategy and beginners coaching.?





My best guess is that money pours into crypto during the first 2
quarters of the year as people get their tax returns and invest in
projects they like. During this time I expect a significantly rising
overall ""market cap"". I think it will cool off some during the summer
and pick back up around the holidays as families and friends get
together and reflect on 2020. During this time I believe we'll see
periods with bitcoin gaining faster than alts, followed by times where
alts are more profitable. The smart, stress free investor is hedged
into several crypto projects as opposed to ""all in"" on one or
frequently switching back and forth between alts and bitcoin. The
market will likely remain volatile but I believe with QUALITY cryptos,
highs will be higher and lows will be higher.Those with patience
who've only invested money they can afford to lose will likely
outperform most ""traders"". I think changing tax laws in first world
countries will further embolden the HOLD mindset, as (in the US) there
is a huge benefit to investors holding assets over a year, much higher
taxes for assets held under a year. I think these changing tax laws
will also encourage investors to look harder at projects they are
comfortable Holding for over a year, so some of the pump and dump
energy will fade. feel free to get in touch with my trusted broker
davislingardcrypto11@gmail.com and he will be sure to provide you every
necessary info you may need to invest wisely in bitcoin and alt coins
.



When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because
my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I
began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more
than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and
can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got
to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this
done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market
outburst in December 2019 was more than enough for me to have a belief
that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some
trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading about
and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I
was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market.
I invested in some coin that eventually ran out of the market in 2019
it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i
wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of
the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video May this year where I
saw some individuals showering praises on this trader Davis Lingard,
so I contacted him his trading signals are really accurate unlike any
signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making
sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet
you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my 1BTC into
5BTC in two weeks and three days I was so amazing because I was tired
of constant losing of my coins here is his contact via Email

inquiries and other insights into trading."

7261,Loving the new content Gregory!
7262,"I have done almost all of this mistakes in the past! Haha 
It was an one way direct ticket to rekt city"
7263,"I lost 15k , and learned exactly what your saying.

We all make that mistake in the beginning"
7264,I’ve made these mistakes over the years as well and this is great advice. Also I would recommend being on at least the top 3 exchanges in US if that’s where you’re located. It’s good to have investments in multiple secure accounts.
7265,Thanks man! this is so much useful✌
7266,Great video content
7267,GREGORY THIS IS GREAT INFORMATION. THANKS THANKS THANKS!

8275,"Nice content you put up always👌.  BTC is the future of crypto, and the question traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest? before jumping to a conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days, the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. my Uncle introduced me to Edwin Dolan, who I started trading with for more than four months. I've made over 38.6 BTC from an allocation of 2.3 BTC  using Edwin Dolan’s help. You can easily get to him on Te le graʍ >>> Eddolancrypto << cheers."

8279,It's very obvious that B.T.C is the most courageous coin on the planet so many people around the world are glued to screens right now due to the recent correcti0n.  I think literally anything could happen now. Previous historical action is all well & good  but remember we are currently in the middle of the single most significant event in the entirety of recorded human history to date -  people worldwide are screwed for funds. BTC could go crazy low from here. I do not want it to but it could easily  - expect the unexpected seems a good plan. This makes it a very hard decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to  hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present prlce chart and also savng your ass from any future deep that may occur. I started tradn with MR Kirk Eli since late last year and till date I have made over so much even with the ups and downs since the journey. Y’all serious minded hodlers? newbles willing to partake in real trad can as well txt Kirk on  tel_le-gram ( @Elicryptos  ) strictly for  serious newbles and exp3rts.

8293,"The current bull run is similar to the previous two. Currently the PI indlcator is about to indicate a Bitcoin top. According to bit¢oin halving a cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and bit¢oin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year.

12810,"Very detailed and precise video you put up mate i love its contents,its funny how some folks out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continues to reshape the world globally, Its hard for anyone going against it these days, though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/lnvestor on how the the community works, lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to HoDL,  I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins should be our goal thereby making prof!ts, it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 13 BTC in just  4weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Brennan Carson. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on Telegram [ *BrennanCarson* ]  on  ͲҽӀҽցɾąʍ   for Crypto related concern."

13929,"You were right for me to get rid of my ETH.  Now, I want to get ADA, but I would have to dump my HBAR due to the exchange that allows me to buy it.  Would you do it?"
13930,Fed Reserve was created because people did panic withdraws and collapsed the system.
13931,"I'm just commenting to help us

🤷🏻‍♂️👍🏻"
13932,Its going down down
13933,Sooooo.  What you are saying is.. (The Miners aka Makers of BTC sell off at an ATH!??) Who wouldn't???? Have you seen the cost of GPUs????

13937,The bull run is over people make sure you take some profits at least for god sake
13938,While other look a chart to try to predict the future... This guy spills facts... Respect.
13939,I just looked outside to see why a dog is barking at my door.......
13940,"Where is the dip, this time. DCA only thing."
13941,"Hey Whales, 
You can't short BTC now. Go for an altcoin"
13942,"How strong the bit coin is now. 

Remember last dump on January 11, hope it won't happen near future.
Buyers are responsible and accountable to push up."
13943,Is there any way to determine if the F2 pool is shorting the market just before the dump on to the market??? Sounds like a potential to make BIG BUCKS!!!
13944,"How many btc do f2pool have?? in 6 weeks they have sold 210k btc, are they buying back in at their own dips?"
13945,Why is everyone freaking out???? Just buy if you can and if you cant just hold its that simple...I can careless what f2pool is doing i just capitalize on the mistakes they make and thats making the market far more affordable...
13946,hold if you can as could be a few more dips before 3pm UK time then boon .. IMO this will rise above 50k around 3pm ( hopefully 51k plus )
13947,Great time to buy folks 😊
13948,chill out man. people buy and sell. that's completely normal :)
13949,Past few days RSI has never even been close to 70 yet dumping! Lol
13950,Isnt it funny how this alines with the fact that alot of tether has been moved to mining related companies and tether suddenly stops printing because they need to backup their tether by USD within 90 days so they are working with miners/exchanges like kraken who are close with tether cme shorts to fill usd bags etc.
13951,"""BTC is too expensive""...don't forget that while the dumping party.
don't be fooled, Whales help themselves to enter at good prices they don't care about retails.
don't sleep when it will be on a good price again and don't miss the train because the climax run will be fast and furious."
13952,"RIP to who ever bought the MASK at 30,000 on Kucoin , that shit dropped to $12 lol , that's was a liquidation trap for peeps or what?"

13962,"I saw the dip as it started, and I was like fucking f2pool at it again.  I woke up opened your channel, and here we go, lol."
13963,LOL guarnteed him told someone to get that dog to SHUT THE FUCK UP!
13964,How can we deal with these ccp manipulation Chinese dumps? should we counter buy it to liquidate their shorts?
13965,Can you feed the dog please???
13966,Can we see how much BTC Fpool still has in their possession?
13967,"I appreciate you so much, that I am George."
13968,Box mining has to be careful what he says about good old China man
13969,The dip was healthy for the eventual btc price. They did btc a favour- they could have dumped the peak and rekt us all

13973,"I never understand this motivation of people to make endless money. I bet those whales doing this own 9 figures of money, yet the aint get enough and dump and do the ETF stuff etc. But at the end we will thank them. These corrections are needed.

13985,I blelieve Michael Saylor is very happy about this dump. Perfect entry point for his clients. Yes I believe Saylor is active in this dump. But is good news in the long term.
13986,I like George
13987,If we are all George doesn’t that mean F2 pool is also George? So technically George caused the dump! I’m on to you buddy!
13988,Do we know how much btc on that wallet? Maybe it's just the begining...
13989,"Be mindful of hopium inducing echo chambers guys, I'm bullish but the people out there giving assurances are not being truthful"
13990,Why weren’t we warned by anyone if it was so predictable
13991,Lmao!! Bitboy had no clue what he barked at! Getting his longs rekt like a rag. F2pool guys must me peeing their pants
13992,Fair to say that the crytpo market is more manipulated than gold and silver .
13993,"They Sell, We Buy."
13994,"Hi George, thanks for Video 👍
Can you please change your youtube setting so that i(we) can change the languages (subtitle) to other languages?
thx"
13995,Personally I am not buying any more Btc until the nonsense F2Pool sell off looks to have stopped. Its several hours since George said he thought F2Pool had stopped dumping. Not correct. The price of Btc is still dumping. It hit $44k and still looks weak. I will may buy some BTC late Sunday afternoon after all the moms and dads panic sell over this coming weekend.
13996,"They are lowering the price ? Buy it. Apparently there is plenty of supply. Haters gonna hate, Sellers gonna sell, buyers gonna buy. So there`s that. This will continue throughout time."
13997,Buyer sentiment is mega strong.
13998,Man your dogs barking
13999,I'm already neck deep in longs on eth... wish I had more cash oh well
14000,"Only thing I can think is we put the pressure on them. If I had to guess, they're probably out of ammo, and sweating bullets right now. A part of me is glad they did it because it prolongs the bull market. Another part of me Hope's they get liquidated. Sure, maybe people shouldn't over leverage, but f2pools blatant disregard for the millions of people they wrecked all for the selfish gains of a few makes me not give a shit if they go broke. Karma always comes to collect. We just don't know when, but it'll come around."
14001,This is really helpful for my situation
14002,george the goat
14003,What is future's expiration date?
14004,767590
14005,Institutions are losing great opportunities to screw the manipulators
14006,You are awesome
14007,Thats why i dont mine on f2pool...
14008,IS THERE ANY...THING AT ALL WE CAN DO ABOUT THE F2. IS THERE NO ONE THAT CAN CONTROL THEM R STOP THEM DOING THESE THINGS??????????🤭🤗
14009,"The issue I was trying to make is that there is a lot of movements that are offchain - via OTC desks and other big traders. The way i view is that the f2pool fund movement is only a symptom of a great plan at work.  Some big miners clearly knew what they were doing and possibly trying to intentionally spook the market (after all normally freshly mined coins like the ones they are moving usually command a higher price on the market, so it's inefficient to just move it to an exchange)."
14010,Microstrategy will buy that back up in less than a week
14011,"Hey George, because the futures occur each month end, is this behaviour likely to occur March end, April end etc etc."
14012,I am George
14013,Buy now because March will be the month to MOON!
14014,Do you know everytime you mention F2Pool dumping thousands of tokens.Everyone else on youtube copies you and mentions f2Pool dumping tokens.Then everyone panic sells to try and beat the dump but end up dumping it lower and lower.Perhaps next time F2Pool dump maybe don't mention it and lets see what happens?
14015,Thanks F2pool so I can buy cheap
14016,Today coin fell low as 36.000EUR. Wake up its going down like brick.
14017,"Actually Btc dumped to $44k. Dump still not over?

Is this how the Chinese Government destroys Btc? Do the Same thing each month and it wont take long before everyone joins in and shorts Btc same time each month. That will kill the credibility of Btc for sure and cause all the institutions to exit the crypto market permanently."
14018,report them to the sec  f2p and the sec is worried about tesla they shouldn't be.  just send this video.
14019,"I dont get it. If someone is manipulating with coin price now to get in with lower price then why not let this coin to drop down to 10€ and start from there ? This excuse of ""wales"" now buying in is getting old."
14020,reporting to you live from 45k !!
14021,Buying ADA
14022,how much market does they have like 80%?

14051,"Hold my hand george, Im scared  :/"
14052,"Ho George love your show. I don't understand that F2pool can have so many BTC to dump, How does anybody do an audit on them. Is it possible for them to produce that many BTC to sell? Something doesn't sound right with these guys, unless the data is wrong."
14053,F2 obviously has PLENTY of BTC to SELL!
14054,Lol of course it dipped as soon as I put 60000 in this morning of course at its highest point smh
14055,"Look at the charts on glassnode into the outflow of ALL miningpools, not just F2pool. You will see that in january there were twice as much BTC who flowed from pools into exchanges. For me this correction is totally normal from the macro perspective. Im more worried abou the bounce that happened a few days ago on the 46k, driven only by FOMO and people being enthusiastic because Square and Michael Saylor invested again in BTC...but the market those still  its own thing."
14056,Not too long till u reach 200k subs! Thanks for all ur work!

14070,Who the fuck cares let them sell.
14071,Yeah.. us thinking we could counter this. F2pool: hodl my beer.. 🍺🍺🍺😂😭
14072,It’s well above 40k guys
14073,A company sold btc and bought cardano for 750 million maybe they’d the cause
14074,How about we all sell out and buy cardano.

14092,Why do speculators put up with this BS leakage on-going? pyramid game is not so cool. Make sure I am not the one last out the door.
14093,it did this about 7 times last bull run yes?
14094,I unsubscribed box mining long time ago. I don't trust him and his analogy.

14096,lowkey this is changpands excuse to liquidate ALL longs....hmmm why?....yea ill be going shopping today ;) crypto shopping
14097,have you looked at the 2013 and 2017 miner bull run selling yet?
14098,So....I sold out. Gonna buy back at the 39-42k it drops too
14099,"Technical question::  I buy $1000 of BTC.  USD-fiat currency collapses, 
devalueing to 50%.  What happens to my BTC WHEN I EXCHANGE IT FOR FIAT 
USD??   If USD are worthless, and I exchange my BTC for USD, I will get 
no USD -- I've lost my $1000.  What if hyperinflation hits USD and it 
devalues by 50% and it inflates to $2000.  Then when I exchange my BTC 
for USD, I get $2000, which is the same price I paid for the BTC in real
 terms.  Which scenario is accurate??  Thanks"

14105,Excellent work George. Much appreciated your sharing and support.
14106,The only reason I’m panicking is because I’m afraid I’m going to miss this dip because I don’t have any more money to put into this dip.
14107,Love the Dump...
14108,Your logic and numbers look solid sir.
14109,"hmmm - if they moved 14000BTC today - they might start making one last giant dump in  a matter of hours and trigger giant panic sell , because their last move and sell off of 3600BTC was crazy and pushed price down -13K , its scarry to think what 14000BTC can do to the exhausted market ?"
14110,Let's make the pricks pay

14117,"We need to wait until another whale steps into the ring. Everyone should be taking minor profits. 

I don't think F2Pool is done yet. They won't have as high of an outflow tomorrow but, it will still be somewhat high compared to the other mining pools. 

I'm waiting for their outflow to hit median and then I'm getting back in and buying coins at discount."
14118,Bro 14000 like wtf where they do dat at
14119,❤️👍❤️👍
14120,People always panic during these times lol. Dumps are blessings in disguised. Sold 6 BTC @ 53.9K and set buy order @$46k. Keep buying those dips!!!
14121,I’m new to buying crypto. I see this as an open door. I’m in.
14122,That is amazing yeah btc is like at 46.6 from like 48 in the last few hours.. btc is going to keep growing very fast I think we'll see 100k by next year (and im just a noob but I've been watching the market since like 2012 ..but I sold my coin like a dummy and forgot about crypto for a few years. Btc for the long hold ripple if u wanna make/lose quick $)

14126,Is it just me or is George the Crypto version of Christopher Walken? You sound just like him!
14127,also Bybit is a scam
14128,"New to crypto, glad I found this channel very impressed with analysis. You need to trademark ""I am George, we are all George""."
14129,F2 pool is turning the frogs gay
14130,"So good, that I predicted this exactly under your last video and also acted accordingly. This could have been the last chance to buy under 50.000 Dollar. Because npw they are sitting on a buttload of money (2 billion Dollars?) and will probably use it for a long position next month"
14131,I got into crypto to avoid manipulated markets. Looks like now that crypto's are a real asset class. The big players are going to control price to try to get our coins. Stay strong and hold the line.
14132,Hi George :) Im New to crypto. Any recommendations on how to learn more? Those charts are so intimidating! Still don’t understand what futures are haha
14133,How many BTC does F2pool have? Does anyone know how deep is their supply?
14134,Gotta be Coinbase colluding w F2 to get Saylor a sub 50k entry for his latest billion buy
14135,Something fishy cuz their logo is a fish as well lol
14136,finally etfs has push down all asset  including BTC lol...
14137,I do wonder what f2pool's reasoning is behind letting go of so much of their holding in such a short time
14138,Why am I George? Why are we all one? 🤔
14139,There may be some collusion between whales and F2 pool.
14140,Have you gotten any Garbage Pail Kid cards?
14141,Input on Akoin? Not available in u.s currently but will be.
14142,Can’t they be sued for this?
14143,I have a huge ladder all the way up to 20k. I'm willing to accept all their donations.
14144,perhaps a 51% attack coming courtesy of Miners colluding?Did notice other pools had a very large spikes just a day before F2.....?....Saylor's Savvydges and the OG's will have us covered....we hope......
14145,George is the man
14146,Actually the sold 0.0003 of the market cap. It crashed the market with that bs
14147,Chuck Norris can make F2 Pool hodl.. and George panic sell!!
14148,Would b kinda cool if it did crash down to 10k lol. That way I   An scoop up 3-4. We all know it’s going to comeback strong
14149,"""I butchered that quote""  😂 yes you did, but you're forgiven. Thanks for a very informative video."
14150,I just don’t understand why other people aren’t talking about this...
14151,🐒 getting 🍌
14152,BTC Options Close at 3AM EST
14153,I don't think the noobs understand HOW MUCH btc the whales can dump on them.
14154,"Keep up the good work George, you shined the flashlight and now the eyes, questions,  and ultimately the answers will follow.  F2Pool thinks they can double dip by betting on the dumps they create while the army of buyers are building a bigger wall to stop them.  Keep exposing the truth as the troops arrive, some big companies are coming to the space"
14155,Made me buy more BTC for cheaper
14156,Why did ADA handle the sell-off so well & ETH so poorly?..
14157,I don't know.  This looks like a bear market to me.  There is next to zero buying sentiment for alt-coins right now except for a few rare exceptions.  No one is buying this dip and hardly anyone bought the last dip.  Looks like prices are resetting lower for the long-term.  Everyone should seriously be careful.  The only thing I holding right now is ADA because its the only thing that is still bullish.
14158,"went home told my family I am george, we are all george... I dont live there anymore!"
14159,"Still thinking that the chinese KP is behind it, Either they only need USD or they testing how much they can hit the crypto market and they started with the biggest pool. Hopefully they don' start a 51% attack once they cashed in all the polled coins."
14160,Im putting together the hunting party. F2Pool is the enemy
14161,"47k is cheap BTC hahahahahaha.

I feel as if this guy is highly invested into BTC. Poor George.

The only thing thats happening is the bull getting exhausted and the charts leading the way for traders. Wether its down or up. This guy is a goon.. Crypto has no value just like anything else."
14162,"Why did Saylor & Dorsey buy at $53k, then?"
14163,"Annoyed, but I also took advantage of the dip."

14165,"You guys... I’m like a month new to this shit.   I’ve done hella research and even I know BTC is about to blast off. No moon boy shit but really. BTC goes up hella, consolidates, consolidates alittle more, dances on that consolidation and then blows up again...     just fucking wait.  Goddamn my mouth is watering"
14166,I just dislike this long ass videos
14167,"By “liquidation on the short side”, do you mean shorts will buy BTC, like a short squeeze (again: the meme stocks rhetoric)?"
14168,Good info. Thank you.
14169,Aren't they profiting as it goes down? They're probably shorting it on leverage as well. So every dump can be higher and higher. Am I right?
14170,Greatly appreciate George!!!
14171,"Do you shorter, summary-like videos, too?"
14172,"Just bought my first BTC. Hodling BTC, ETH, BNB and LINK. Hope you’re right about this George!!!"

14198,"I can imagine the convo between the two, I see the value of this going up can you get it down to at least 40k so i can jump in on the trade, I'll reimburse you once we hit 100k.
Sure, I mean, I can try to get it to 40k for you, but given how much hype this has, you're just gonna have to take what you feel is the bottom."
14199,"Thanks for all of your hard work on this George. You’re 100% right.  There is no way to deny the impact of F2Pool and that they are trying desperately to hold the price down. Knowing why this is happening, though, makes me so much more confident to buy the dip, which I did!"
14200,he killed his dog
14201,"So.... Basically they got screwed in their own game? Lol 1 or 2 whales were selling to keep the price low, without thinking that 10 more whales were buying, jumping in the opportunity? Lolol"

14252,F2 Pool is selling to the big dogs like Saylor and Musk.  That’s what’s happening.
14253,am not cool enough to be a George.:)
14254,Didn't F2pool say they had only dumped 10% of what they have?
14255,I think the fight is going on. Those fucking whales are selling a lot at discount.
14256,How much do they have?!? Can they do this indefinitely?
14257,Maybe we can buy graphics cards for MSRP now ;)
14258,Talking about it ..it is what it is ..part of the market ..manipulation .short sells.etc etc...no one bitches on spikes

14260,jesus christ i needed some good news lmao
14261,Boxmining is an idiot
14262,Hope the dump isn't over as we need to see 42k
14263,People sell their Alt coins to try and get BTC at a deal when they see it go down. This is why when BTC price go down a bunch of Alt coins go down then eventually BTC starts rising. Then they sell and buy back into Alt coins. Very profitable
14264,George we need a deep dive video from you regarding Algorand (ALGO) loads of people from your stream were asking for it too

14375,Just because it’s dropped all the way 11100 we have seen a small pump I do think this could be a short dump so this could be the blast off that we are waiting for. I don’t know much on fractals but I do know buying and selling. It is great that bitcoin going down it love when I can buy more bitcoin for a discount. Will it be hard to look at my statement for a while I do believe I will have moments to quite but I will remain bullish and long term.

14461,Ledger pls
14462,"Thanks Zombie, BAT coming ur way"
14463,"Thanks for the manipulation explanation.  I have been rattled today.  Stock market still going up, dollar still going down against the euro, but gold and bitcoin (and just about every other crypto) going down, so a plausible explanation helps.  I guess when the market cap of bitcoin (or is it the market cap of active bitcoin, since gold's market cap is quite large and we are seeing the same thing there) gets big enough these CME clowns will find someone else to annoy. Would have been a good buying opportunity today but the coins I have my eye on to purchase next (ADA, DOT, MANA, ENJIN, SOUL) are not yet on Coinbase and not on Uniswap (not ERC20).  Tried to get further with Binance US KYC today but my selfie did not demonstrate sufficient ""liveness"".  Will be dead before I get through at this rate.  In my opinion, crypto suffers from not sufficient coverage of tokens by exchanges that allow the use of fiat by bank transfer or debit card (in New Mexico!).  I would be happy enough to buy some coin on Coinbase and then use a super-Uniswap which covered *all* some coin to any token swaps.  Omniswap. Would need a super-Metamask wallet that could hold all coins too.  We need an Atlanta hub exchange and the Delta Airlines stable coin on Coinbase."
14464,"You are right, dude. They just wanna scare us into selling. Everyone should HODL and take full advantage of the dumping by picking up some more bitcoin at discounted prices!"

14938,No one does it better than hackbywilliams on !G he is absolutely the best of his kind
14939,The bit where they say having Democrats in Georgia will help pass fiscal stimulus without Republican resistance is a joke. They are the ones who blocked everything
14940,SUNDAY FUNDAY! CHARTS UPDATE SUNDAY WAIT TO BUY UNTIL THIS SUNDAY!!!
14941,"Bitcoin prices slipped lower Tuesday but maintained a strong foothold near critical support levels in the $30,000-31,000 range as traders awaited the outcome of Georgia’s runoff elections. The flagship cryptocurrency slipped 0.75 percent ahead of the New York opening bell, as for me it can’t be more obvious that trad!ng Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn’t think it was possible to make constant wins from trad!ng till I came across Ryan Beavis  who aids  investors/newbies lacking understanding on how trad!ng Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin, since late last year till date I have made over 45 BTC with Ryan’s help. You can easily get to him on TeIeg:ram ryanbeavis or Wh@t spp +1 7 7 8 5 0 8 9 8 3 0 for any Crypt0 related issue."

14953,Good Video! What do you think about IOTA?
14954,Straight to the point:  I'd love a Ledger!  Thank you!
14955,"At the moment I watch the video it was already 34.4K, the 32K resistance did not hold for shiz :P."
14956,What im trying to understand is whether to sell eth if expecting this btc correction. I looked at an overlapped chart and its hard to get a definitive answer..
14957,Thank you for the content
14958,Best video so far.
14959,Btc my soap opera
14960,"Bitcoin closes 2020 as best performing asset of the last decade,I didn't know how valuable what I had in my wallet was until I ran into luck meeting  Jason McCallister of Crypto Tribes Men because of how much his strataegy and da!ly s!gnals have been of benefit to me, I would still advice people to buy at this price and also achieve more with the little you hold so as to build as very strong portfolio ahead of the New Year market."

So I do CryptoZombie therapy; while Hodling, and for that reason I'll just say 'SHOW ME THE LEDGER'. We live in hope."
14989,We are in the beginning of a huge feedback loop.
14990,"I think you summed it up in the intro video, I've said it before Bitcoin dips aren't going to last at lower prices, institutions have done the maths ( we did the hard work  😏) and they won't Bitcoin.... imagine in a few years saying that you didn't buy at 30k 🤭"

15008,"""When is the best time to buy Bitcoin?.....March of 2020 or today! LOL. Or how about in my case in 2015 when it was under $300. Yeah...that's me....bought into BTC in mid 2015 and forgot all about it until 2017 when I saw it on the news at $2000. You can bet I watch it daily now and of course have added more and the top 8 altcoins over the years. Retirement......I am waiting!"

15031,waiting for the dump since 15k lol
15032,I’m still laughing at the intro
15033,"Institutions aren't cashing out. They are buying BTC and ETH as long term holds, within their company investment portfolio's as a hedge against inflation. They've all made that perfectly clear."
15034,awesome content as usual kdub - thank you for all you do for us! just wanting to see if you had any thoughts on the potential on DOT being a security or the likelihood of something like that cuasing a severe dump like we saw in xrp? been hodling and accumulating since the 5 dollar level
15035,I’m just here for the Ledger!
15036,I miss 10k bitcoin lol
15037,Cheers mate.    Great info

15069,great job and thanks
15070,"15:40 I bet there will be loads of people who will be like ""But ETH just broke1150 USD!"", not realise Kay Dub was talking about ETHBTC. I have friends who only look at ALTUSD and thinks all the Alts are doing really well. :D"
15071,"If Democrats win the Georgia seats.. UBI will eventually become law, US becomes a socialist country, then you have 5 years to get the fuck out of here before u start working in forced farm camps to produce food for it citizens or prostitute your daughters for bread....

15072,i think we still have 75% left in the bull market
15073,ZNN
15074,"Every person I know who has bought Bitcoin wishes they had bought more. Once the toe is dipped will institutions feel the same? If so, they have the resources to follow up with even larger purchases ala Saylor. Could get interesting."

15081,"Been watching a while now, like the channel. Keep up kdubz"
15082,Crypto Zomgie is the 🐐!!
15083,Max Keiser says 42k.. if that happens we will more than likely repeat much like 2011. Spike to 56k. And make a bowl shape formation - which sill take 6-8 months (cup and handle) down to 30k back up to 56k in august and fomo to topping out well last 100k end of 2021/early 2022
15084,Just waiting with 50k here to buy when it falls
15085,"So if I bought $8,000 of bitcoin at 33,200k should I hold on to it or sell and see if it drops to 31k before buying again ?"

15097,k-dub save us
15098,"Thx kdb,I think alt need will come eventually later on , maybe 4 years from now!! But I don’t think we will see another gain with altcoin just like btc and eth!! I think only reason people invest in altcoin is for huge profit but I’m afraid this not the case ,unless you have huge amount of money.😔"
15099,Regulation shemgulation! We are gonna moon K Dub

15176,Institutional money never intends to take profit by out right selling their position anyway - financial industry accumulates so they can remarket BTC into parts of other investment products (selling custody non-tradable exposure to BTC/ETH/etc.) & to generate revenue in collateral markets. Businesses are directly investing because it is still a mostly unregulated alternative risk instrument & protects against missed revenue targets.

15185,B4U thanks Zombie. What do you think about CRO? Spammers will be reported!!
15186,"Question: if bitcoin really is a de facto coin and not just a barter instrument do you forsee any concept of older early coins in the block chain having a sentimental/numismatic value up and above whatever paired currency it is exchanged for? Are all BTCs really ""equal"" given private exchange between individual's for goods/services/quality is SUBJECTIVE and time dependent? How about the fact that the energy-time cost in mining early BTC ""coins"" is so much less expensive than current coin mining? Anyone forsee an age of coin differential value concept in the trade space barter?

Also note: Bitcoin seems to defy the universal problem of entropy- actually a reverse entropy. It does not age nor rust nor go into higher states of disorder over time as does all other material things (concepts do NOT age except if replaced with higher concepts of same principles). In fact due to loss of coin by accident or carelessness (owners of private keys dying with no instructions to their estate holders to give them the keys to the wallet) BTC is anti-inflationary and MUST become ever more rare as its imperfect humans lose the coins (gaming their owner's own entropy loss toward disorder- Alzheimers at the very least).

Any thoughts on this?

Another thought. We have collaborative groups donating charity CPU time to discover Marsenne prime numbers (very useful for cryptological applications; eg PrimeNet)..a new species of crypto coin could be created from discovery of new Marseene Primes (now requiring super computers and large collaborative computing volunteer networks to find). If these new discoveries were NOT made public those new primes could be used as private keys to generate all new species of mathematical based crypto. Just tossing this out to the community..."

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[ Nakamoto's identity remains unknown..

Email address, phone number, home address, and any other person information used during sign up, as well as your username and complete name used to sign up for the service. If you have an account number or membership number this is needed as well. All emails you have received from this company in any regard, shape, or manner. The total amount owed to you, along with any proof of such. Invoices, screen shots, emailed admissions from them with promises to pay and so on. Proof of what they owe you is of extreme importance, BUT this does NOT mean they still cannot recover your money for you even with lack of proof. You may not have these records...they do!

They will do a complete investigation on the company. Background check, company status (if they are a licensed company), as well as financial paper work filed with their local agencies. Once they have evidence exposing them as a scam or fraud involved in illegal activity, they will contact them on your behalf. They will discuss your case with them, while also pointing out proof of illegal activity. Once they know they have them, it is usually enough to recover your funds fairly quickly. Here is their email address: CRYPTORECOVERYX @ CONSULTANT. COM"
15342,"Investment scam is all over the place in recent times and due to greediness people fall victim daily to bogus promises. May i tell you that  out of 100% of people or companies advertising investment, just like 2% can guarantee the outcome. The rest are mere scorn artists who just want to take your money. Thread with caution!

This is also a signal to all regulatory authorities to buckle up. You must know that if cryptocurrency is prohibited in your jurisdiction you do not have business with it. The reason being that when there is a problem or abuse, the investor lacks government protection.

If you sense that you are being defrauded by an investment company there are few steps listed below which could help you to recover them if you have all your proof of investment and conversation history. The following are the process:

Firstly, if cryptocurrency is regulated in your jurisdiction like in the United States, File your complaint with the SEC. Why file with the SEC? Some of these companies are registered and it is the duty of the SEC to regulate them. Filing will make the SEC investigate and bring down the company. This is usually not the case as we have experienced in our quest to recover money for victims of fraud. Virtually all the companies are unregistered and are usually operated by fake individuals with fake identities. So reporting to the SEC may not really do justice.

File a report with any Law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction, like the FBI in the US. The essence of this is for investigation but this usually is not an easy one since most of them operate with fake identities and FBI’s investigation is usually very slow. Making it that before the investigations concluded the scorn would have emptied the wallet.

The next is that if the amount lost is what you can bear, please bear it and invest no more.

The last option is that you should try using virtual asset recovery companies. However, i must strongly advise you to thread with caution because most of these investment companies now pose to be recovery companies and they are out there to steal from you. This is owing to our experience in the recovery industry.

Some people have been defrauded twice because they went to the wrong place to seek help. Do not be desperate. When you send your complaint to contact@activebonorum.com the firm will review your claim to ensure that you really invested with these companies and if the same turns out to be successful, the firm would proceed from there.

Finally, I must advise you to inform www.activebonorum.com you that you have been defrauded due to the trauma that comes with this. Also, inform your therapist if need be."

As we all know the world is evolved already and crypto currency is on a speedy rise regardless. I attended a business submit months back held by Mrs Anabelle in the United Kingdom. I never had any knowledge about how it is being done, until Expert Mrs Anabelle gave some speeches and broke each stage in details. I was able to learn strongly underperformed bitcoin processes during BTC's move to $18, 000... In fact the most recent rise from $13,000 to $18,850. I decided to invest with $5,000 and in interval of 14 days business trading with Expert Anabelle I was able to earn a benefiting profit of $19,820. 
I got this idea from a friend who is a beneficiary and a witness of Expert Mrs Anabelle Trading techniques and this worked for me countless times.
... I steady invest again after every 7days interval in her platform which was held late 2018.

How on other can the vast majority of society have confidence investing in crypto when it is so manipulated. 
Today #btc is hovering yet again been 55k - 60k but as the weekend approached you can garentee the price will fall sharply only for it next week to retrace to current level.

Do you have any views on Tether and whether government intervention could affect the crypto market?
In these unusual times, the central banks are going to extraordinary lengths to keep markets inflated - if there appears to be a flight to bitcoin or crypto in general, it is not inconceivable that they would take measures to prevent this and taking out tether (frequently the token with the highest daily volume) would potentially have a devastating impact."

I have a few suggestions for future videos. 
1 - I recently came across BiDao which is Binance's version of Maker. I like the idea of using BNB as collateral and using a trustless stable coin on the platform. 
2 - Also in regards to Defi, I would love to see a video on keyless crypto wallets such as ZenGo or Argent as I feel these are needed to onboard more users into the crypto space.
3 - Finally, in regards to NFTs and gaming I have been following a project called Ultra (UOS) which I consider to soon be an industry game changer. I would like your opinion.

15452,"Great vid tonight, Guy.  Very informative.  Everyone new to the cryptoverse should watch it for their financial health.   The SEC, though, is a joke.  Remember the MF Global scam?  An ordinary guy smelled something wrong, gathered up tons of data and took it to the SEC.  Nothing happened.  He sent the same package to them a second time, still ignored.  When the Ponzi scheme tanked thousands of people lost their hard-earned retirement savings.  THAN the SEC closed it down and the CEO got jail time.


Jamie Dimon is the Hillary Clinton of the banking world.  JP Morgue has been manipulating the PM market and stocks for years.  The Feds show up and make a big deal about their trades, fine them $25,000,000 and tell him not to do it again.  It's a joke -  they pay the fine out of the billion dollars made on the illegal trades like paying $10 fine for robbing a bank of millions.  It's a lucrative venture he's got going there."
15453,"It's pretty simple to avoid all of these:

1. Don't day trade!
2. Do you own research on the project, team, CEO...
3. Do not think of it as buying coins/tokens, think of it as buying part of companies...Warren Buffet style (BTC included)
4. After you made your research buy coins/tokens it and make a plan (hold for #years,  hold till that price...) and follow the progres of project
5. Store coins/tokens of exchange on hard/paper wallet
 
That way you won't even notice all these market manipulations, because you'll know why you invested your money and what is your plan."

Just recently, B!tcoin hit a new record high of $58,000. 48 hours later, the pr!ce plummeted to just above $46,000. The drop followed a weekend in which Tesla CEO and B!tcoin fan Elon Musk tweeted skepticism at the coin's seemingly unstoppable rally, saying he thought the cryptOcurrency could be overvalued. But B!tcoin believers have remained bullish. The coin has climbed again and is tradinng near $50,000.

16600,when she says mean she means meme
16601,"lmao ""crashing"""
16602,"Bitcoin uses a series of pseudonymous keys. A variety of derivative keys can be instituted that prove ownership of a key and all derived keys. It does not prove identity. There is no way to conclusively prove identity by means of a cryptographic method. More importantly, there should not be. An individual can enrol with a certification authority to demonstrate and assert control/ownership of a key. Such a process provides evidence but not proof.
In the future, with Bitcoin, individuals will create deterministic hierarchies of keys linked to their identity. Even so, it will only be evidence and not be proof. If a mere private key could be used as definitive proof and not merely evidence, we would implement a system far more draconian than forcing every person on earth to carry an identity card. With Bitcoin, organisations will be able to create identities and pseudo-identities that allow them to use individual services without linking. As such, identities will be firewalled isolating each set of records from other organisations.
The nature of proof is such that individuals choose how they can provide the evidence needed for a particular use case. If they need to prove something in court, they will give just enough evidence to definitively prove something in court. Where a party seeks to prove ownership of goods, they can do so without having to link more information than is required. Such is the nature of privacy. When police and law enforcement seek to investigate money laundering, they can investigate an individual and track the source of funds. People fail to see the problem with mixers: source-of-wealth laws exist. Right now, if you are found in possession of hundreds of thousands of dollars and you cannot explain the source, it can be seized. Bitcoin does not stop the seizure of assets. If you believe otherwise, you should look at the many cases that have already occurred. Hundreds of criminals have already had Bitcoin confiscated.

Decentralisation

It is not decentralised nodes that make Bitcoin powerful. It is decentralised power. In Bitcoin, such an end is achieved as the protocol is set in stone. If a miner seeks to alter the protocol, they need to make all users update their node software. And Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) allows users to ensure that miners do not deviate. If a miner deviates by, for instance, adding a new opcode, the SPV node will consider it invalid. As a result, even if the miner achieves well over 50% of the network control by hash power, the miner will not control the network without convincing the users of the network to move to the new protocol.
The reality is that a small group of individuals behind something like ‘CoreCoin’ (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) do control the protocol and can force users to upgrade. They are systems acting as doppelgängers that are not Bitcoin. Effectively, they are subverting the use of open-source structures and voting systems to hide the acts of the leadership. They are falsely engaged in obfuscating legal responsibility and hiding behind a false pretence of distributed power. The truth is, Bitcoin is only distributed and only removes power when the system cannot be changed. The ability to change the system, to add new opcodes, to in any way alter the protocol… that is the power structure within Bitcoin and for that matter any blockchain.
They who are in charge of the various alternative currencies including the sham versions of Bitcoin (BTC) seek to deflect the fact that they control the respective system. They seek to say that miners control protocol, and yet fail to say that they, in fact, alter the protocol using rhetorical flourishes such as calling a poison-pill change designed as a soft fork that leaves prior versions incompatible a choice. Here, changes to the network can be implemented without voting or notification.
A small group which controls the protocol makes decisions that impact all users of the system. When things work, and the community using the system does not see the problems of altering the protocol willy-nilly, the leadership takes ownership, but at the same time, it deflects all bad decisions or errors by saying it is a distributed system.
For Bitcoin to be successful, the protocol needs to be stable. New versions of software can be developed and created while not changing the underlying protocol. TCP/IP has hardly changed at the protocol level in the last 20 years, and yet, it has changed remarkably and gained a lot through more effective software implementations. For Bitcoin to work, the protocol needs to be fixed and set in stone. A protocol that is set in stone signals to developers and businesses that they can invest for the long term.
The sophistic rhetoric will tell you that Bitcoin is designed to make a censorship-resistant currency, and yet the very people making the argument have the power to invalidate transactions. The same people have the power to alter the protocol and make specific software implementations invalid and to drive people out of the industry. With a stable protocol, one that is set in stone as a requirement as I indicated nearly a decade ago, nobody can choose who can and cannot build on Bitcoin.
All the major social platforms, Twitter, Facebook, and even Google, have been infiltrated by social justice warriors seeking to destroy meritocracy and bring banality to the world. They call it diversification. The truth is that it is racist, homophobic, sexist, and every other -ism that one could consider to be distasteful. The growth path of Twitter has ended, and the user base is slowly declining. The reason for it is that you cannot serve two masters. Organisations can seek to be the best at what they are and what they seek to deliver, or they can lose to the market and capitalism. Just as socialism failed because it could not measure the value of what people sought in society, many organisations are now finding that they will not be able to survive the infiltration of mediocrity."

16628,"I’m not saying bitcoin is bad, actually is a great idea but👆 I think If the dollar starts crashing, all these billionaires are going to start investing as much as possible in btc before their dollars loose more value.  When that happens governments around the world will not take bitcoin at all because it was bought with devalue dollars. You guys think governments are just going to materialize the transformation of devalued dollars to bitcoins into assets of properties in any other country?  When and if the dollar looses a lot of value and billionaires start buying bitcoin, when this takes place governments around the world will heavily regulate btc and probably create their own crypto currency like China and others. I think this crypto was created by these billionaires that are expecting the crash and can’t turn all their money fast enough into other assets. They are trying to make it sound great to make us the little man bring in money to their new fiat system. In other words they are replacing devalued fiat money with btc. Unfortunately China, Russia, India and the rest of the emergent economies are not so naive. They are already and have been protecting their economies from the dollar crash for at least a decade and more notably the past 4 years. They have been trying to get rid of as much dollars as possible to get less impact from the crash.  I doubt they’ll take any btc which was bought with devalue money. Just sayin."

16636,"With over half of the human population, over 4 Billion people not online or using a computer, who is Cryptocurrency great for, the ""Winners""? If a Bitcoin is worth roughly $47K (Fiat US Dollars) a coin, if the Dollar is dropped as the international currency and becomes useless, no value, what will Bitcoin be worth? Zero? Who are the people with Bitcoins that are willing to sell them for Fiat Dollars if the Dollar is soon to be worthless? That sounds like a game of musical chairs, why would someone with Bitcoin be willing to sell them and be stuck with Fiat Dollars when the Dollars crash is said to be so imminent? What's driving Bitcoins value other than speculation and people wanting to get rich quick, plus the fear of missing out? The big boys and girls jumping in, like Elon the God, various Countries, and Central Banks?

I will say, I wish I would have listened to Max Keiser years ago and bought a few thousand Bitcoins when they were selling for .50 a coin, I'd be filthy rich like some people became from doing so. Then again I would have sold a nice bit of them for Fiat Dollars to gain what we know of now as currency. Anyone have any Tulips for sale?"

Don't worry my friends...  you can't ban programming protocols such as bit coin, etherum, or any number of other value programming protocols.

Also, doing it backwards or the opposite way you do from a TOP to a bottom to the continued price level.

16694,The miners are selling because a huge political and world event will be happening. there will be another and bigger crash once that happens.
16695,Andrew Charles Weber told me about this fall  weeks ago and had me invest my 2BTC through trading than holding on to it in my wallet. Today with the fall my crypto still grew to about 19Btc through his trading strategies. He is what I call God sent ❤️

16711,"I don't know any investment vehicle withing the markets industry that gre more then 1000000% in less then decade,  let me guess based on a mathematical infrastructures equitation, is it not normal for a 50 to 75% pullback in the crypto community?  Also short term is small thinking lotto winners,  long term thinking is big business, if all the largest corporations in the world had to narrow there view points on short term, they would not be where they are. So why be different? And that also applies to almost every area of life."
16712,"This is normal guys. Hold on, this won’t last long;)"
16713,"Why do btc channels on youtube alway put titles with capitals, many exclamation marks and thumbnail photos with open mouths, shouting? Completely ridiculous. This is the best reason why btc is delayed being taken serious by the mainstream."

16723,"I believe that Bank of America mainly, among others, is behind this particular weekend Bitcoin BEAR RAID raid that we just experienced DO NOT BE FOOLED!

Bitcoin is not protected from manipulation by the SEC and whales manipulate the  hell out of it

Bitcoin makes the individual sovereign and makes central banks irrelevant.

Just hang on tight, It’s going to be a bumpy ride at times. Remember to keep a little cash on the side for buying the dips."
16724,"PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT! MUST READ. 

DONT USE PAYPAL TO TRADE. I have noticed that everytime I try to make a good trade by selling high and buying low when the market is very volatile, that PayPal gives me an error or security reason stopping me from making a good deal. Yet, after it's too late, I'm able to buy, no problem. 

PAYPAL IS WORKING WITH THE WHALES"
16725,"The only reason to cry about the current dump is if you have a short term perspective. But then why are you investing in Bitcoin in the first place? I bought a little at 39k yesterday because I expected it to blast through to 50k in no time, but instead it did the opposite. Yeah it sucks a little, but it’s not a big deal. I'll just wait to see how low it goes, then buy a little more, and enjoy the show when it begins going back up 🚀"
16726,Miners are selling because the 3 Gorge Damn is about to explode. Don't say I didn't warn ya. 😘

16732,"Here’s a food for thought no one is noticing, Bitcoin went double last all time high meanwhile Altcoins came no where near their previous all time high. This is due to the fact that before they were 1,200 coins and now they are 8,000 coins. I don’t see altcoins doing anything like they did last time can someone correct me if I’m wrong."

Also do you guys think it’s better to exchange BCH to BTC instead? I’m more leaned towards BCH."

16766,You drew your Eth fibs upside down. Eh...?
16767,What if it crushes like 2017? That's +80% of the value??
16768,"Should I buy now or wait for the price to lower, from what I understand the price is so low because miners are selling, but then again the industry is buying a ton. So does that mean it could maybe go up a little bit??? Should I buy some before that happens or wait for a bit. Let me know if what I said is correct."
16769,"""Normal health market move"".  Good wording that's why I've totally lost confidence in the 100% fake rigged stock market.  I thought I was buying companies not investing in Fed money printing.  The stock market is nothing but money printing graph if you graph stocks and money printing you'll see it's 100% correlated."
16770,"i have 1.5 ETH, bought @1100 , It hasn’t even had his bull run though. That was just a warmup"
16771,"if it is caused by miners, then please explain me, why the same is happening on stock ????  Are there any miners diggin up Tesla, or apple stock ???"

16775,"Guys remember, Bitcoin is a hype right now, Youtubers make money from videos and want the hype to continue. No one can predict the future, Please only invest money into bitcoin that you can lose, If you're not prepared to potentially lose money you will sell out at a loss. Do I believe in bitcoin? Yes. But be realistic, it's not going to 100k overnight. Play the long game, cash out some profits and be sure to save coins for 5-10 years. You should take profits when you can and re-invest into bitcoin."
16776,"I hope that you're wright.🤞
Whtat's your prediction on Dostrict0x?"
16777,How long before you think it goes back up?
16778,Mind the Dip Shits haha 🤣

16786,Is because of the new rules in trading apps 😂😂😂
16787,dump it and be wise---don't be greedy---be smart
16788,"A sharp decrease is often referred to as a ""normal healthy market move."" Bad news is often good news."
16789,"Awesome info, well put!"
16790,What do you think about Guggenheim saying they're selling some of their coins this morning?  As if they would announce that before selling.  I bet you they sold and now they're making the announcement.  I guess institutions are in the business of day trading or swing trading but also manipulating the price.
16791,can’t believe people expect btc to go from 10k to 100k in a single leap without pullbacks.
16792,"Great content, thank you!"
16793,"Love your content! Thanks for your opinion, I was wondering which platform you use for your charts and if you've got to pay for it. Thank you!"

16802,"Brought Stellar lumens at £0.24
Nice to know i didn't make too much of a mistake."
16803,"Enjoyable video, you have a new subscriber."
16804,Should I hold my ether? Should I sell now and wait for the big dip to buy more? Or is this the big dip??
16805,Good analysis
16806,I ain't no weak hand.
16807,"how low btc and eth should go,, its a least utiuber should say .. thank u"
16808,The whole reason we go on rollercoasters is for the drop😎
16809,This guy sounds like Moon Lambo
16810,People are dumping bitcoin to take fiat profits. Make you wonder why people even invest in the first place.
16811,Love you 💋💋😘😘❤️💯
16812,"I've watched tens of videos and i noticed that, most of them if not all, are just guessing and repeating the same infos. They don't have a clue about what is going on. And every youtuber has his followers and his ""great video, super content..."" Comments. What they are trying to do is to stop the selling as much as possible and not to freak you out, so the price dont go further down.
I am no economist, just a jobless dude trying to survive."
16813,My first rodeo and I'm def gonna pick up some more ETH today....just trying to time it just right.
16814,i like u
16815,Appreciated your calm assessment of the situation. So many technical analysts on YouTube try and attract views by being over emotional but I think your approach is so much easier to watch and the information easier to absorb. Thank you.
16816,"I bought some more at 33 this morning. I could be wrong, but I think it's a good bet."
16817,Thanks Randall. You are definately improving your TA! Keep it up!
16818,You want to be fooled. Dont listen to this idiot we are going back to 10k
16819,Hodl hodl and hodl
16820,HODL don't sell we are not sheeps
16821,Great Stuff Randall !
16822,thanks really good video
16823,Thanks :-)
16824,"Great buy zones coming, appreciate the sales when they come"
16825,Literally bought ETH mid day yesterday at 1228.. hurts a bit to say the least right now. I hope this isn’t a major dump and continues
16826,Btw. does anybody else seem to notice that NEO coin is the only coin that is not dumping but just going as it was... 🤔
16827,Thanks for the video.  Started following you about a week ago have been watching all the new videos. Good stuff!
16828,"Thank you for making this video it calmed me a bit. I've been a btc Hodler for over 3 years now but it's come to a point it's no longer fun when drops like these happen and you loose a couple new expensive sports cars or small house (value wise) in one morning from a 17% drop 😂 Part of me keeps wondering if it would be smart to just get out of the full crypto market now I also wondered at 41.000 dollars. But I keep thinking how sad I'd be the rest of my life if it goes to 100K in the next half year and I miss the boat. But I'll feel even more sick if we go back to 20k and I have to keep working my shittty job for the next 25 years 🤣🤣 knowing that I could most likely retire right now and live a happy simple life 🤔 just don' know what 2 do at least your video calmed me a bit and I thank you for it, keep up the nice content 👍"
16829,we need the beard back
16830,"Love the dump! Hopefully, we'll  get to 20 ish then alt coins. Yea!"
16831,What is the graph software that you use?

16837,Lol its giving you a unicorn horn
16838,people will come back for more. so it doesn't matter
16839,I have one Bitcoin asic and I just turned it on recently because I did not want to mine at a loss. I would have sold some Bitcoin too if I was mining for a loss. I also would have taken profits at 40k.
16840,Where is your sexy beard? :(
16841,Thanks fella
16842,Unbelievable- you seriously are asking ppl too hold whilst btc dumps!? I bet you would not if you bought at these high levels...terrible advise!
16843,"Hmmm...but I thought paypal, square,  etc., were buying it all up. What happened to that thesis?"
16844,"I panicked because I didn’t take profits and sold! Why do people say don’t sale? 
My take on it is, where am I harming my self by selling and buying back in at lowest lows?
Am I misled with my logic please explain! I have already lost profits so am I supposed to take a chance on loosing my initial investment too? It may seem like a dumb question but I am  befuddled when people say don’t sale!"
16845,Like I said from day Jan 1st you will be tested if you buy BTC and ETH
