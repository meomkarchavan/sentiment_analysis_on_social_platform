136,couldnt we just buy BNB directly from Trust wallet? thanks for the video tho!
137,This token is nice and cheap right now
138,I just bought $446 of saturna and it went through but my balance is now $446 less than it was before it went through.
139,Saturna!!!
140,Up 800% in 2 days not bad. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝
141,"*edit, I didn't click on the smart chain in the trust wallet**         When switched to bep20 it say ""the address doesn't match the currently selected primary network"""
142,I swap about 200 buck worth of bnb but its showing i only have 1.1 Saturna? did i do something wrong>?
143,Can you use ethereum to buy instead of BNB?
144,"I posted the saturna contract address into pancake swap but it's not showing up. Can anyone help? So frustrating trying to buy saturna, shib, kishu and keep running into roadblocks."
145,"I appreciate you showing people how to go through the process of buying these up and coming cryptos. 

I see a ton of crypto YouTubers doing 10-15 videos on shibe, kishu, akita, etc. and not a single one of those videos actually teaches you how to buy any of them. If you're a newbie like me, it's a very confusing process. 

Lots of websites and wallets to sign up for and get verified on, many of which take their sweet time doing, network fees in the hundreds of dollars that present problems with investing (Having this problem with uniswap and shib. $371 network fee??) etc. 

I've already missed out on gains for plays that I would have done but couldn't because Binance is taking forever to verify, and buying BNB on Trust Wallet is agonizingly slow. Coinbase has a 1-week waiting time before I can send the ETH on there anywhere else. If you're a newbie like me, make sure to take care of all these hoops as soon as you can."
146,To late to get in on the train you think ?
147,amazing project!! 🚀🚀🚀
148,"Binance takes forever for identity authentication. Any other suggestions on how to purchase BNB smart chain to then convert to SAT on pancake swap? I have a Coinbase account, but cannot find BNB Smart Chain listed anywhere. Apologies for the noob-y question. How I'm understanding it is below, and I'm stuck at the second step

Exchange (Binance) -> Smart Chain BNB into wallet (metamask/trust wallet) -> swap smart chain BNB to SAT on pancake Swap"
149,this is going to be massive.
150,How can i see thow many dollars i have i cant see it on trust wallet?
151,best purchase made
152,💎💪
153,I love this project 🔥🔥
154,I purchased from pancake but i dont see the volume of shares on trust wallet.  Its showing 0.34XXXXXX instead of 340 million shares i see on pancake.
155,For some reason when i purchased saturna it doesnt show up on my trust wallet like how all my other crypto show up. Doesnt show me how money i have and the ammount of shares shows different than others. It shows like this. 0.432882. Mean while i did purchase about 400+million shares. Kinda odd to me. Also the charts are unavailable.
156,massive gain potential!

162,Change the name of this video or take it down. Very misleading.
163,"It seems you have found your answer, maybe take the video down for reasons, that people may just take the headline of your video and run with it. Unfortunately that's the world we live in now. But for the good and the sake of all Saturna Holders, I speak for all of us right now, please take this video down."
164,I’ve nothing but stellar experiences with Saturna. Been with them since day 1 and I’ll be hodling long term. 🚀🪐
165,Binance can suspend bsc transfers!! If you try swapping on pancake swap then you’ll be charged fees and retuned your initial investment (minus fees)
166,"I think you talk none sense! 

You’ve got a feeling.. I bought in a few days ago and it’s returned well. 

Learn how to use pancake swap you fool!!"
167,you might want to take this video down lol i havent lost a cent
168,Im up 5 figures in a weekend wtf you on bro? Hahahahaha
169,You didn't change the decimal to 9 like you were supposed to when you added saturna as a custom token. Stop spreading bullshit news when its operator error.
170,Come on guys explain my last comment need to know what's happening with this and if its fees then that's a joke to get 0.6 of a token out of 600million what kind of bull is that
171,"This is the highest level of misinformation I've ever seen... $SAT isn't the scammer here, you are and shame on you...🙄"
172,"So took a chance and bought £70 worth it says on bscscan that I'd get 686.248.864.723250844 tokens 
And in my trust wallet I only have

173,"Lmao you are totally not informed about this project, stop spreading misleading FUD"
174,The fuck is this? I already made 30x with saturna. It's not a scam.
175,"made 4k profit, you can do the same ;)"
176,Guys you are rite I am a noob so could be wrong i did state he could have been hacked etc thats why I said to comment on your experience with it so I could get an idea of what's going on I only stated (I think) so any input would be helpful and its come to light that he did get hacked
177,"Same here, made like 10x profit. Website looks legit too. Dosent seem like a scam to me..."
178,You have no idea what you are talking about.  Sorry your friend is an idiot and gave out his wallet information.
179,"I am just happy with saturna, i’ve got more than x4 profit since token release . <4 days"
180,This guy is so dumb 🤣 user error completely
181,"Sorry to hear about your mate being done dirty like that, but $SAT has already been audited and passed with flying colours with a second audit on the way. Not a scam, the only this this is doing is spreading misinformation sadly."
182,NOOB SATURNA WILL HIT THE SKY

I started to use Binance and expected CRBN to be available there, it wasn't.

I have checked for other platforms and signed up to Kraken. Nothing there either. Many other platforms don't exactly spark my trust and I want to keep the number of registrations in check.

Any ideas as to where to get CRBN or wether I missed something on Binance? Cheers!"

659,"I have noticed on more than one occasion and not only on your channel but on others as well, that the coins you talk about pump in no time and as soon as you start to become interested and ready to buy, the pump is over. Very frustrating. I have been in this crypto space since end of February. I have made several mistakes as you would expect and bought and sold at the wrong time. I am learning and have made decent gains. However I always seem to be in the coins that do NOT pump but go up and down with the eb and flow of the altcoin market.I like your style Benson but find it frustrating seeing other coins but your own pump at ,large percentages."

You are getting paid from those companies to pump their coins up. You’ve been talking about cardano for months and nothing happen!! I don’t believe you anymore"
738,Auction (Bounce)!🚀
739,"I've been a holder of CRBN since the token sale in November, and I've been following it very closely ever since. Carbon is an amazing project with incredible potential. It's one of the few crypto projects where I can actually get my hands on the product I'm invested in, and I can see for myself the progress it is making. CRBN is not highly correlated with Bitcoin's price action, and it has really helped keep my portfolio stable when my high-caps are crashing.

As an early investor in this project, I want the developers to take their time and build out the idea they've laid down in their white paper and blogs before they open the flood gates for new users. This project could serve as a valuable link between the regular world and the crypto world, and I want every new user to be able to experience the vision that is guiding the developers in its creation. Until then, the developers are very much in touch with their community and they've got a group set up for feedback/ideas/bugs.

Make an account, try it for yourself, and come join us! The platform feels like a growing village right now, but in the months to come it will explode into a thriving metropolis full of colorful characters that Twitter and Facebook hate (but the internet loves). Carbon isn't trying to become a ""Twitter killer"", Carbon wants to be Carbon, a truly unique and powerful social platform jam-packed with features no other platform possesses. It isn't trying to win the game, it's re-inventing the game with a whole new set of rules designed to benefit the users. For this reason I am insanely (and even irresponsibly) bullish on CRBN ;)

CRBN to the moon :D"
740,💚Akash Network (AKT)💚
741,I also would recommend to buy BABB ( BAX) 100x posible !!

785,beautiful....micro caps!!!!!
786,i watched this video and found carbon rlly interesting so i tried to make a carbon account bt it said i needed a meta mask account with activity so i sent some ETH from trust wallet to metamask and it never showed up. I Lost my money

788,"LOL.  So I decided hey why not put down $200 on CRBN for funsies.  Moved $200 in USDT from Binance over to my Trust wallet, ERC20 fee was about $30.  Have $170 left.  Hook up Uniswap to my Trust wallet and try and exchange USDT to CRBN, fee is $97.  Screw off."
789,Nice advertising 🤣🤣
790,Where is the best place to buy these crypto? Thanks
791,How much they give u for promoting coins
792,Spaceswap could be the best play out there. Super undervalued and totally under the radar.

811,FOX finance is the next one ! Super strong project and awesome community !
812,Sorry but Cosmos (Atom) is pretty similar to this Hedget if Im right. So that makes Hedget number 2 right?
813,It’s not on Coinbase or binance🤦‍♂️
814,Don't buy Carbon on uniripoff I mean Uniswap.  Use Bilaxy if you can.  Gate.IO u can pair with USDT.  I cant wait for Cardano smart contracts to land.  Etherium is the biggest rip off of all time.  Fee'd to death!
815,Holochain  💥💥💥💥
816,Can we buy crbn at Binance?
817,I've had my carbon tokens since last year and been getting the airdrop for being in top 300 :) thanks for the pump I was just complaining in the chat that we were a stable coin
818,I looked into doing a swap on Metamask and the fees were around $150-$170. Is that right (never done a swap before). Sounds crazy
819,$FWT - research it now or regret later.. yw

822,"Fix what you wrote , you wrote that its a financial advise"
823,can you have a look at copiosa please
824,Good to see you covering micro-small caps. I think everyone should have 5-10% in this explosive space. $500 of TRIAS rocketed to my most valuable holding in a month and it’s still under 50mil market cap! TE Foods TONE also has been a huge boost to my portfolio and more than makes up for the ones that tank. My question is how does Hedgit profit from options? If I took an option on TRIAS and it’s up 800% how are they mitigating that risk?
825,"Thanks much for these great gems! If you know, could you tell us which platforms to buy these if living in the United States?"
826,should check out $UBX
827,Please make more videos like this.
828,"It's very difficult now for any new social network to gain mainstream adoption and use. I suppose Tick Tok has achieved it, but that's because it's found a unique use case: people with an attention span of about 20 seconds, of which there are very many."

858,How did you even buy these ?
859,"I don’t believe there will be a new social media platform, the market is saturated enough, there’s hundreds which release and fail, what’s so different about this one?"

861,99.99% is a big number bro xD
862,Trias!!
863,How do you buy these coins?
864,"For me the best decentralized social media is Mastodon, though that lies outside the crypto currency space. Might be a controversial take, but many technologies being created using blockchains, while cool & shows the true power, don't need to be on a blockchain to be decentralized. Carbon does look pretty promising for a Twitter alternative dedicated for the NFT space though."

Before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a good look at things first. For the past few days the price of XRP has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going to bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making loss, other are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me, i started with $9,500 and i have accumulated over $89,600 within 2weeks with the trading strategies given to me by Expert Mr Powell His method are top notch and profitable, obviously he's the best. You can What///sap him."

1070,"<< The current bullish run is identical to the previous two. Remember when everyone previously used the Robinhood app (or Coinbase pro) before what Robinhood did with the GME stock buying which led to the mass exodus from Robinhood to alternative apps. That was before my time with Bit¢σιи but I heard about it. Well, since now so many people use Bi-nance, Bybit etc and everyone is shorting Bit¢σιи on those platforms all at the same levels, could this have anything to do with the bull market potentially being over with Bit¢σιи? It’s a sincere question we should find answers to in other not to make too many losses. At the moment, the PI indicator is about to indicate a Bitcoin top. From observations of bitcoin halving cycles, there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run, so, if the PI indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year.I was able to gain the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still stucked between massive losses due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all this changed when I encountered Renato Jace's service., although I have been into numerous services but Renato Jace stands out with experienced expertise in the field. I must confess it wasn't an easy task learning the routes on trading but with his assistance, I earned a lot Ͳҽ  Ӏҽցɾ ąʍ  @Renatojace  ,,, ░ w  ░ p ░  +    1 5  5  1  2  8  7  6 2 0 2,,,"

1074,I checked into this one and ummmm...I think I will wait on the side for a sec to see if they release more info. They don't show their team or anything. Atleast with Bonfire you got to see the team and they did an actual live video. I would love to jump in but there are so many scams going on. So I will wait and see.

1126,The global pandemic hit the financial market like a wrecking ball and the effect of that on Bitcoin has been no different. The prices of stocks fell all over the world due to masses looking to liquidate stocks due to the global crisis that prevailed. Bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies followed suit of the financial market and its price halved down from what it was at the beginning of 2020. Many argue that this pointed to Bitcoin being no different than the traditional stocks. Bitcoin was introduced after market crashed in 2008 and its identical behavior to that of the traditional stock
